		<desc>THIS CARTRIDGE, WHICH INCLUDES AN OVERLAY. PROVIDES AN "EASY" WAY TO PROGRAM THE ASTROCADE IN MACHINE LANGUAGE. THOUGH NOT A Z-80 ASSEMBLER. MLM DOES SIMPLIFY THE ENTRY OF HEX CODE (WHICH OTHERWISE MUST BE ENTERED USING DECIMAL VIA BASIC. ALSO THE KEYPAD LAYOUT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE USE OF THE KEY-SHIFTS, SO TYPING IS FASTER). PROGRAMS CAN BE SAVED VIA THE BALLY BASIC 300-BAUD.</desc>

		<path>./Solar Conqueror (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Solar Conqueror</name>
		<desc>THE GAME'S RELEASE DATE IS 1982 ON THE GAME BOX AND 1981 ON THE CARTRIDGE.

SOLAR CONQUEROR IS A TOP-DOWN VIEWED SHOOT 'EM UP WITH MULTIDIRECTIONAL SHOOTING AND MOVEMENT SIMILAR TO ASTEROIDS OR ROBOTRON. THE WAR HUNGRY DEMENS ARE THREATENING TO WIPE OUT THE PLAYER'S RACE WITH A RADIATION DEATH RAY AND THEREFORE THE PLAYER HAS TO CONQUER THEIR SOLAR SYSTEMS.

EACH SOLAR SYSTEM CONSISTS OF TWO OR FOUR PLANETS AND TO CONQUER THEM ALL PLANETS HAVE TO BE DEFEATED. IN EACH SCREEN A PLANET IS LOCATED TO THE FAR RIGHT OF THE SCREEN AND FROM IT VARIOUS ALIEN DEFENDERS WILL APPEAR. TO DEFEAT THE PLANET AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONE THE PLAYER HAS TO KILL ALL THE ENEMIES WHILE AVOIDING GETTING HIT BY THEM. THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT ENEMIES: KAMIKAZE COMBAT SHIPS, GROUND-TO-AIR MISSILES AND SUPER FIGHTING (KILLER) SATELLITES. THERE ARE ALSO ASTEROIDS FLOATING AROUND THE PLANETS THAT HAS TO BE AVOIDED. LARGER PLANETS HAVE STRONGER GRAVITY WHICH LEADS TO THE SPACESHIP BEING HARDER CONTROL. THE EFFECT OF THE GRAVITY INCREASES AS THE SHIP GETS CLOSER TO THE PLANET.

THE GAME CAN BE PLAYED BY UP TO FOUR PLAYERS. BEFORE STARTING OUT IT'S POSSIBLE TO CHOOSE HOW MANY LIVES EACH PLAYER SHOULD HAVE AND AT WHAT LEVELS THEY SHOULD START ON, THEREBY HANDICAPPING MORE SKILLED PLAYERS. ANY CONTACT WITH AN ENEMY, A PROJECTILE OR A PLANET LEADS TO A LOST LIFE BUT A NEW ONE IS GIVEN FOR EACH SOLAR SYSTEM CONQUERED.</desc>

		<desc>RELEASED ON THE ARCADES AS SPACE ZAP AND FOR THE BALLY ASTROCADE AS SPACE FORTRESS.

THIS IS A FIXED SCREEN SHOOT 'EM UP WHERE THE PLAYER IS IN CONTROL OF A STATIONARY LASER BASE WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN.

THE GAME IS CONTROLLED WITH FIVE BUTTONS: ONE FOR SHOOTING AND FOUR FOR AIMING, ONE FOR EACH DIRECTION. IN ADDITION TO THE MINES AND ALIEN SHIPS THERE ARE ALSO ATTACK SATELLITES THAT ORBIT THE LASER BASE BEFORE ATTACKING. THE MINES ARE WORTH 250 POINTS, ALIEN SHIPS ARE WORTH 500 POINTS AND ATTACK SATELLITES ARE WORTH 2,000 POINTS. THE PLAYER STARTS OUT WITH THREE LIVES BUT EARNS A NEW ONE AT 75,000, 150,000 AND 300,000 POINTS.</desc>

		<name>Star Battle</name>
		<desc>STAR BATTLE IS A SPACE SHOOTER BASED ON THE TRENCH RUN SEQUENCE FROM THE ORIGINAL STAR WARS MOVIE. THE GAME IS FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS AND INVOLVES A BATTLE BETWEEN AN X-WING AND A TIE FIGHTER, ALTHOUGH SINCE IT DOESN'T CARRY A LICENSE THEY ARE NOT CALLED THAT. THE X-WING IS CONTROLLED BY PLAYER ONE WHILE THE TIE FIGHTER IS CONTROLLED BY PLAYER TWO OR THE COMPUTER. BEFORE STARTING OUT A MAXIMUM SCORE (1-999) IS ENTERED AND THE PLAYER THAT FIRST REACHES IT WINS THE GAME. A SINGLE HIT IS ENOUGH TO BRING DOWN THE ENEMY SHIP AND IT IS WORTH ONE POINT.

THE GAME IS VIEWED FROM A THIRD-PERSON PERSPECTIVE WITH A PSEUDO 3D REPRESENTATION OF THE TRENCH. THE COLOUR OF THE TRENCH CHANGES CONSTANTLY TO ILLUSTRATE THE FORWARD MOTION OF THE FIGHTERS. BY MOVING THE JOYSTICK UP OR DOWN THE FIGHTERS ACCELERATE OR DECELERATE WHICH MEANS THEY MOVE TO THE TOP OF THE SCREEN AND DECREASES IN SIZE OR MOVE TO THE BOTTOM AND GET LARGER. IF ONE MOVES CLOSER TO THE CAMERA THE OTHER GETS FURTHER AWAY AND VICE VERSA.</desc>

		<name>Treasure Cove</name>
		<desc>TREASURE COVE IS AN ACTION GAME THAT TAKES PLACE OFF A SMALL ISLAND IN THE CARIBBEAN WHERE THE PLAYER HAS TO DIVE INTO THE OCEAN AND SEARCH FOR THE TREASURE OF A LOST SPANISH GALLEON. THE ACTION TAKES PLACE ON A SINGLE SCREEN AND THE PLAYER STARTS OUT IN A SMALL BOAT AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. AT THE BOTTOM THERE ARE SEVERAL PIECES OF TREASURE THAT HAS TO BE RETRIEVED (ONE AT A TIME) BUT THE OCEAN IS ALSO FULL OF FISHES AND OTHER SEA CREATURES THAT HAVE TO BE AVOIDED. ANY CONTACT WITH THESE (INCLUDING THE SMALLEST OF FISHES) WILL LEAD TO AN IMMEDIATE LOSS OF LIFE. A LIFE IS ALSO LOST IF THE PLAYER RUNS OUT OF OXYGEN WHICH MEANS IT'S NECESSARY TO PLAN AHEAD SINCE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO GO BACK TO THE BOAT (AND RECHARGE THE OXYGEN) EMPTY HANDED. WITH THE PRESS OF A BUTTON THE PLAYER CAN MOVE QUICKER BUT AT A HIGHER COST OF OXYGEN. AFTER CLEARING ALL TREASURE FROM THE COVE THE GAME WILL MOVE ON TO A NEW LOCATION WITH MORE VALUABLE TREASURE BUT ALSO WITH MORE FISHES.

THE GAME CAN BE PLAYED BY ONE TO FOUR PLAYERS IN HOT SEAT. BEFORE STARTING OUT THE NUMBER OF LIVES FOR EACH PLAYER CAN BE CHOSEN FROM ONE TO NINE. THERE IS ALSO A TOURNAMENT LEVEL MODE WHERE EACH PLAYER HAS FOUR DIVERS. THIS MODE WAS MEANT FOR PLAYERS WHO WANTED TO MAIL THEIR HIGH SCORE TO THE DEVELOPER FOR HIGH SCORE VERIFICATION.</desc>
