		<path>./Nightmare on Elm Street, A (USA).zip</path>
		<name>A Nightmare on Elm Street</name>
		<desc>LJN'S NES VERSION OF THE CLASSIC HORROR SERIES CASTS THE PLAYER AS A TEEN SEARCHING THE HOUSES ON ELM STREET FOR FREDDY KRUEGER'S BONES. ONCE THEY ARE ALL COLLECTED, THEY MUST BE THROWN INTO THE HIGH SCHOOL  FURNACE TO DESTROY FREDDY ONCE AND FOR ALL (A PLOT SIMILAR TO 1987'S A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3: DREAM WARRIORS).

NIGHTMARE HAS TWO WORLDS. IN THE RED-TINTED "REAL WORLD," PLAYERS FIGHT SNAKES AND SPIDERS WHILE NAVIGATING STANDARD PLATFORM CHALLENGES. THE PLAYERS HERE HAVE A "SLEEP METER" THAT DEPLETES WITH EVERY HIT TAKEN. IF THE PLAYER'S SLEEP METER DROPS TO EMPTY, THE GAME TRANSITIONS INTO THE BLUE-TINTED "DREAM WORLD," WHERE ENEMIES TAKE ON THE APPEARANCE OF SKELETONS AND GHOSTS. AN INVISIBLE TIMER ALSO STARTS, COUNTING DOWN UNTIL FREDDY APPEARS AND FORCES THE PLAYER INTO A BRIEF BOSS BATTLE. THE SLEEP METER BECOMES A STANDARD LIFE GAUGE IN THE DREAM WORLD, AND DEDUCTS A LIFE FROM THE PLAYER IF DRAINED.

PLAYERS CAN FIND AND COLLECT THREE DIFFERENT ICONS IN THE DREAM WORLD TO BECOME "DREAM WARRIORS" WITH SPECIAL POWERS AND PROJECTILE ATTACKS - BOTH OF WHICH GIVE A SIGNIFICANT EDGE WHEN FIGHTING FREDDY. COLLECTING ALL THE BONES IN A LEVEL TAKES THE PLAYER TO A FINAL LEVEL BOSS, USUALLY TAKING THE FORM OF A MONSTER WITH FREDDY'S FACE OR TRADEMARK RAZOR GLOVE. PLAYERS MOVE BACK AND FORTH DOWN ELM STREET, AND A NEW HOUSE OPENS UP AS THE PREVIOUS ONE IS CLEARED.

NIGHTMARE IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE NES FOUR SCORE ACCESSORY, ALLOWING UP TO FOUR PLAYERS TO PLAY AT ONCE USING THE SAME SCREEN.</desc>

		<desc>PLAY A WOULD-BE HERO IN THE CITY OF HILLSFAR, WHERE ACTION AND ADVENTURE AWAIT THE DARING ADVENTURER. JOIN THE LOCAL GUILD AND COMPLETE MISSIONS FROM THE GUILD MASTER IN A QUEST FOR GLORY AND GOLD!

HILLSFAR IS A "SINGLE-HERO" ROLE PLAYING GAME (IN COMPARISON TO OTHER ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS RPGS, WHERE THE PLAYER USUALLY CONTROLS A GROUP OF CHARACTERS). A COMBINATION OF 1ST PERSON PERSPECTIVE (WHEN TRAVELING IN THE CITY OF HILLSFAR) AND 3RD PERSON PERSPECTIVE (USUALLY IN SOME ACTION-STYLE MINI-QUESTS) VIEWPOINTS.

AS A WOULD-BE-HERO, FOUR CLASSES ARE AVAILABLE IN A RANDOMLY GENERATED MISSION-BASED PLOT: THIEF, MAGE, FIGHTER OR CLERIC. EACH CLASS, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, HAS A DIFFERENT APPROACH FOR COMPLETING QUESTS.

IN HILLSFAR, GAMEPLAY USUALLY CONSISTS OF VARIOUS "MINI-GAMES" THAT ARE NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE QUESTS OR MISSIONS PROVIDED AT THE LOCAL GUILD BY THE GUILD MASTER. THESE MINI-GAMES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:

1. FIGHTING AT THE ARENA (3RD PERSON PERSPECTIVE)
COMPETING AT THE ARCHERY RANGE (1ST PERSON PERSPECTIVE)
EXPLORING BUILDINGS OR MAZES (TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE)
RIDING A HORSE WHILE AVOIDING OBSTACLES (3RD PERSON PERSPECTIVE/SIDE-SCROLLING)
LOCKING PICKING DOORS AND CHESTS (1ST PERSON PERSPECTIVE)

UNLIKE MOST RPGS, THERE ISN'T ANY "RANDOMLY GENERATED MONSTER COMBAT" IN HILLSFAR. RPG COMBAT ONLY OCCURS IN THE ARENA.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons : Pool of Radiance</name>
		<desc>LOCATED ON THE NORTHERN SHORE OF THE MOONSEA IN FORGOTTEN REALMS, PHLAN WAS ONCE A FLOURISHING TRADE CITY. HOWEVER, LATELY MONSTERS BEGAN SETTLING IN IT, GRADUALLY TURNING WHOLE DISTRICTS INTO RUINS. ONLY NEW PHLAN REMAINED UNDER HUMAN CONTROL, BUT ITS INHABITANTS ARE AFRAID TO VENTURE INTO THE MONSTER-INFESTED AREAS. IN ORDER TO CLEAN THE NEARBY BARREN RIVER AND REBUILD PHLAN, LOCAL AUTHORITIES SPREAD RUMORS ABOUT ALLEGED RICHES HIDDEN SOMEWHERE IN THE CITY. A PARTY OF ADVENTURERS, ATTRACTED BY THESE NEWS, SAILS TOWARDS PHLAN AND ACCEPTS THE QUEST.

POOL OF RADIANCE IS THE FIRST ADAPTATION OF THE ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS ROLE-PLAYING SYSTEM IN A COMPUTER GAME FORMAT. IN THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME THE PLAYER CAN USE A PRE-MADE PARTY OF SIX CHARACTERS OR CREATE EACH OF THEM FROM SCRATCH. SIX RACES (HUMAN, ELF, DWARF, GNOME, HALFLING, AND HALF-ELF) AND FOUR CLASSES (FIGHTER, CLERIC, WIZARD, AND THIEF) ARE AVAILABLE. THE PLAYER CAN TWEAK THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE CHARACTERS AND ASSIGN A MORAL ALIGNMENT TO EACH ONE.

EXPLORATION OF THE TOWN AND HOSTILE AREAS (DUNGEONS) IS VIEWED FROM A FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE IN A PSEUDO-3D WORLD. ENEMY ENCOUNTERS ARE RANDOM AND TAKE PLACE ON SEPARATE ISOMETRIC COMBAT SCREENS, WHERE PLAYER-CONTROLLED PARTY AND ENEMIES TAKE TURNS FIGHTING EACH OTHER. EXPERIENCE POINTS ARE AWARDED FOR DEFEATING ENEMIES, AND CHARACTERS LEVEL UP AFTER HAVING ACCUMULATED SET AMOUNTS. FIGHTERS GAIN MORE ATTACKS, THIEVES BECOME PROFICIENT IN BACKSTABBING, WHILE CLERICS AND WIZARDS CAN MEMORIZE MORE SPELLS TO CAST BEFORE THEY NEED TO REST. NON-HUMAN CHARACTERS CAN ALSO "MULTI-CLASS" (LEARN THE ABILITIES OF ANOTHER CLASS) WHEN LEVELING UP.

THE NES VERSION WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER VERSIONS. IT REMOVED REFERENCES TO THE ADVENTURE'S JOURNAL AND SOME OF THE MORE COMPLEX FEATURES OF THE COMPUTER VERSIONS, LIKE DIFFERENT CURRENCY UNITS. BATTLES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN SIZE, THE GRAPHICS WERE OVERHAULED AND REDESIGNED SO THAT THE GAME COULD BE CONTROLLED WITH A CONTROL PAD, AND MUSIC WAS WRITTEN FOR IT. A RANDOMLY GENERATED DUNGEON FEATURE WAS ALSO REMOVED.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons And Dragons - Dragon Strike</name>
		<desc>UNLIKE ITS NAMESAKE ON COMPUTERS, THIS VERSION OF DRAGONSTRIKE IS A STRAIGHT ACTION GAME WITH A TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE. SET DURING THE WAR OF THE LANCE IN THE DRAGONLANCE WORLD OF KRYNN, THE PLAYER CONTROLS DRAGONS IN MISSIONS AGAINST THE FORCES OF EVIL.

AT THE START OF THE GAME, ONE OF THREE DRAGONS CAN BE SELECTED (BRONZE, SILVER AND GOLD), EACH WITH DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES IN SPEED AND ARMOR AND TWO DIFFERENT BREATH ATTACKS. IN EACH OF THE MORE THAN 12 MISSIONS, SEVERAL OBJECTIVES MUST BE COMPLETED: ENEMY DRAGONS MUST BE HUNTED DOWN, SHIPS SUNK AND FORTRESSES DESTROYED. THE DRAGON CAN CHANGE BETWEEN LOW AND HIGH ALTITUDES TO AVOID OBSTACLES AND ENEMY FIRE AND TO ATTACK CERTAIN TYPES OF ENEMIES: GROUND TROOPS CAN ONLY BE DESTROYED FROM THE LOWER ALTITUDE, DRAGONS ONLY FROM THE HIGHER ONE. KILLED ENEMY DRAGONS LEAVE POWER-UPS THAT GRANT TEMPORARY PROTECTION, SPEED, OR LET THE DRAGON REGAIN HEALTH. SOME OF THE MISSIONS INCLUDE BOSS BATTLES AGAINST LARGE ENEMIES LIKE A GIANT KRAKEN OR A POWERFUL DARK WIZARD.

IN TWO-PLAYER MODE, THE SECOND PLAYER (WHO CAN SELECT A DIFFERENT DRAGON) CAN CONTINUE IN THE MISSION WHERE THE PREVIOUS PLAYER FAILED.</desc>

UNLIKE THE TWO PREVIOUS LOLO GAMES, HERE YOU CAN WANDER AROUND A WORLD MAP AND ENTER DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN A NON-LINEAR FASHION. HOWEVER, SOME OF THE LOCATIONS REMAIN BLOCKED UNTIL YOU FIND A KEY AFTER COMPLETING ANOTHER LEVEL. 

THE GAMEPLAY IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE ONE OF THE TWO PREVIOUS GAMES. YOU HAVE TO COLLECT ALL THE HEARTS IN EACH ROOM. ENEMIES WILL PREVENT YOU FROM DOING THAT, AND OTHERS WILL APPEAR ONCE YOU HAVE EATEN ALL THE HEARTS AND ARE HURRYING TOWARDS THE EXIT. THE PUZZLES INVOLVE MOSTLY PUSHING THINGS TO PREVENT ENEMIES FROM STOPPING YOU.</desc>

ADVENTURES OF LOLO IS A PUZZLE GAME, AND EACH LEVEL IS A CASTLE ROOM. THE GOAL IN EACH ROOM IS TO COLLECT ALL THE HEARTS. IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY, BECAUSE SOME HEARTS ARE BLOCKED BY ENEMIES WHO WILL SHOOT YOU WHEN YOU CROSS THEIR PATH HORIZONTALLY OR VERTICALLY (OR BOTH). ONCE YOU COLLECT ALL THE HEARTS, A TREASURE CHEST WILL OPEN AND ACTIVATE ALL THE CREATURES IN THE ROOM, EVEN THOSE WHO WERE NOT HOSTILE UNTIL NOW. YOU MUST QUICKLY CROSS THE ROOM TO THE EXIT WHICH IS NOW AVAILABLE TO GO TO THE NEXT ROOM. THE GAME CONTAINS 50 ROOMS IN TOTAL.

THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL INCREASES WITH EACH ROOM, AND AFTER A FEW LEVELS THERE IS AN ESPECIALLY HARD ROOM WITH TOUGHER ENEMIES.</desc>

WHEN CONVENTIONAL DEFENSE TACTICS FAIL, THE FEDERATION LOOKS TO FIND A SPECIALLY SELECTED PERSON, HAL BAILMAN AND EQUIP HIM WITH A SPECIAL "LIGHTSHIP". HIS MISSION WILL TO BE TO FLY THROUGH THE DEFENSES OF THE EIGHT KNOWN AIR FORTRESSES AND DOCK AT THE AIRLOCK. THEN HE MUST TRAVEL THROUGH THE FORTRESS IN ONLY A SPACESUIT TO FIND AND DESTROY THE CENTRAL CORE. ONCE THE CENTRAL CORE IS DESTROYED, HAL MUST THEN QUICKLY FIND THE EMERGENCY LIGHTSHIP AND ESCAPE BEFORE THE FORTRESS EXPLODES.

THE GAME IS MADE UP OF TWO PARTS. THE FIRST PART IS A SIDE-SCROLLING SHOOTER ON THE SURFACE OF THE AIR FORTRESS WHERE YOU MUST AVOID VARIOUS FLYING ENEMIES AND TRY TO DESTROY AS MANY WAVES AS POSSIBLE. THIS LASTS UNTIL YOU DOCK WITH THE AIRLOCK. ONCE DOCKED, YOU WALK THE INSIDE OF THE AIR FORTRESS AT YOUR OWN PACE. HAL IS EQUIPPED WITH A JETPACK RATHER THAN A JUMP AS WELL AS A BLASTER WEAPON AND A MORE POWERFUL BOMB WEAPON. ANY MOVEMENT OR FIRING YOU DO CONSUMES ENERGY WHICH IS REGENERATED BY STANDING STILL. YOUR GOAL IS TO BLOW UP THE CORE AND FIND THE ESCAPE SHIP BEFORE EXPLOSION.

POWER-UPS TO INCREASE ENERGY OR BOMBS CAN BE FOUND IN EACH PART OF THE GAME. ADDITIONALLY, SUPER-BOMBS (CLEAR SCREEN OF ENEMIES) AND INVULNERABILITY CAN BE FOUND WHILE FLYING THE LIGHTSHIP.</desc>

		<desc>ANTICIPATION IS A VIDEO BOARD GAME FOR ONE TO FOUR PLAYERS (BOTH COMPUTER AND HUMAN). THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO BE THE FIRST TO COLLECT A CARD FOR EACH OF THE FOUR COLORS ON THE GAME BOARD. DURING EACH TURN THE COMPUTER WILL DISPLAY SEEMINGLY RANDOM DOTS, THEN A PENCIL STARTS CONNECTING THE DOTS TO FORM A PICTURE. THE FIRST PLAYER TO CORRECTLY IDENTIFY THE PICTURE WILL EARN A CARD FOR THE COLOR OF THE PICTURE BEING DRAWN. AS THE PICTURE DRAWS, A DICE ON THE SCREEN WILL COUNT DOWN FROM 6 TO 1. WHATEVER VALUE IS SHOWING WHEN A PLAYER SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFIES THE PICTURE IS THE NUMBER OF SPACES THAT PLAYERS GAME PIECE WILL MOVE ON THE GAME BOARD FOR THE NEXT TURN. THE COLOR OF THE SPACE THE GAME PIECE LANDS ON WILL DICTATE THE CATEGORY FOR THE NEXT PICTURE TO BE DRAWN. 

EACH GAME WILL CHOOSE FOUR CATEGORIES FROM THE VARIOUS OPTIONS, WHICH INCLUDE: TOOLS, MAN MADE, CLOTHING, FOOD, MATH, OFFICE, TRAVEL, MUSIC, THINGS, NATURAL, LEISURE, AND MANY OTHERS. AFTER YOU'VE MASTERED THE EASIER SKILL LEVELS, THE DIFFICULTY CAN BE INCREASED WHICH WILL PRESENT MORE COMPLICATED PICTURES, REMOVE SOME OF THE DOTS FROM THE PICTURE, OR ELIMINATE THE DOTS ENTIRELY.</desc>

		<desc>THE ORIGINAL BREAKOUT CONCEPT INVOLVES CONTROLLING A BAT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND USING IT TO CATCH AND DIRECT A BALL SO AS TO HIT ALL THE BRICKS WHICH ARE ARRANGED AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. IT WAS UNPOPULAR FOR OVER A DECADE, BEFORE TAITO REVIVED IT WITH SOME NEW IDEAS IN THIS ARCADE GAME.

THE GAME'S PLOT REDEFINES THE BAT AS A VAUS SPACESHIP, THE BALL AS AN ENERGY BOLT, AND THE BRICKS FORM A MYSTERIOUS WALL STOPPING THE SHIP FROM PROGRESSING TO SAFETY.

BY THE MID-80S, POWER-UPS WERE POPULAR IN MOST TYPES OF ARCADE GAMES, AND ARKANOID FEATURES THEM. THEY ARE CAUGHT BY POSITIONING THE BAT BELOW THEM AS THEY FALL (MEANING THAT YOU RISK MISSING THE BALL IF YOU GO FOR THEM AT THE WRONG TIME). THE POWER-UPS INCLUDE LASERS (WHICH ARE MOUNTED TO EACH SIDE OF THE SHIP AND ALLOW YOU TO SHOOT OUT THE BLOCKS), A CATCHING DEVICE (SO AS TO BE ABLE TO FIRE THE BALL OFF AT A DIFFERENT ANGLE EVERY TIME YOU HIT IT) AND ONE THAT SLOWS THE BALL.... SORRY, BOLT.... DOWN. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE GAME INSPIRED TONNES OF CLONES, FEW OF WHICH ADDED ANYTHING ELSE.</desc>

THE GAME PLAYS LIKE A STANDARD ACTION-BASED PLATFORMER. THE LEVELS FEATURE PLENTY OF ENEMIES AND GAPS YOU MUST JUMP OVER. YOUR ONLY WEAPON ARE STICKS OF DYNAMITE. WHEN YOU THROW A STICK, IT WILL BOUNCE OFF THE FLOOR AND EXPLODE ONLY AFTER A COUPLE OF SECONDS, SO VERY PRECISE AIMING AND TIMING ARE NEEDED TO DEFEAT THE ENEMIES. MANY LEVELS CONTAIN OPTIONAL TREASURE CHESTS AS WELL AS HIDDEN DOORS THAT LEAD TO BONUS LEVELS. SOMETIMES LEVEL PROGRESSION IS NON-LINEAR, I.E. YOU CAN JUMP STRAIGHT TO A HIGH-NUMBERED ZONE IF YOU FIND THE CORRESPONDENT DOOR ON THE LEVEL. ALL THE LEVELS ARE TIMED. THE PROTAGONIST DIES WHEN HE FALLS INTO A PIT, TOUCHES AN ENEMY, OR RUNS OUT OF TIME.</desc>

LJN'S GAME DIFFERS COMPLETELY FROM THE COMPUTER VERSIONS, AND PLAYS AS A LITERAL RACE AGAINST TIME BROKEN UP BY BRIEF ARCADE MINIGAMES. IN THE MAIN GAME, THE PLAYER CONTROLS MARTY IN AN OVERHEAD VIEW AS HE RUNS DOWN THE STREETS OF 1950S HILL VALLEY.  A COLLECTION OF PERIOD-APPROPRIATE BAD GUYS BLOCK HIS PATH, INCLUDING BULLIES, HULA HOOP GIRLS, BUMBLEBEES, AND PARK BENCHES.  THE CAMERA SCROLLS FORWARD AT A FIXED SPEED, SO THE PLAYER MUST KEEP MARTY ON THE MOVE AND AWAY FROM OBSTACLES. HITTING ONE CAUSES MARTY TO FALL AND LOSE A LIFE. THE PLAYER MUST ALSO COLLECT CLOCKS SCATTERED ON THE STREET TO STOP MARTY'S PHOTOGRAPH FROM FADING AWAY.  IF IT FADES COMPLETELY, MARTY IS ERASED FROM EXISTENCE.

STREET RUNNING SECTIONS LEAD TO THREE MINIGAMES. IN THESE, MARTY MUST SLING MILKSHAKES AT ONCOMING BULLIES, DEFLECT KISSES (SHOWN AS HEARTS) FROM HIS MOTHER, AND COLLECT NOTES TO ROCK OUT ON STAGE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL DANCE. THE FINAL STAGE RESEMBLES THE STREET SECTIONS, AS THE PLAYER MUST CONTROL THE DELOREAN TIME MACHINE AND COLLECT ENOUGH ENERGY TO TRAVEL THROUGH TIME (SHOWN AS LIGHTNING BOLTS INSTEAD OF CLOCKS).</desc>

YOUR TASK IS TO FIND YOUR WAY THROUGH MONSTER-INFESTED LABYRINTHS AND TO DEFEAT THE INCREASER  WHATEVER HE (OR IT) IS.

THE GAME IS AN ACTION PLATFORMER WITH MORE EMPHASIS ON EXPLORATION THAN ON "JUMP &amp; RUN" GAMEPLAY. YOU DON'T DIE IMMEDIATELY IF A MONSTER TOUCHES YOU, BUT HAVE A LIFE BAR THAT GETS GRADUALLY DEPLETED AS YOU ARE HIT. DEFEATED ENEMIES BRING YOU ENERGY POINTS, WHICH YOU CAN SPEND TO BUY UPGRADES. YOU START WITH A SWORD, BUT LATER OBTAIN OTHER WEAPONS AS WELL. THE GAME'S STRUCTURE IS NOT ENTIRELY LINEAR; MANY AREAS HAVE DIFFERENT DOORS LEADING TO DIFFERENT PLACES.</desc>

		<desc>LIKE KONAMI'S OTHER ADAPTATION OF BATMAN RETURNS, THE NES VERSION IS A SIDE-SCROLLING BEAT 'EM UP. NEXT TO BRAWLING ACTION, IT ALSO FEATURES TWO SECTIONS WHERE THE PLAYER CONTROLS THE BATMOBILE AND THE BATSKIBOAT SEEN IN THE MOVIE.

IN THE BEAT 'EM UP SECTIONS, BATMAN HAS TO DEFEAT A LARGE NUMBER OF ENEMIES (MEMBERS OF THE PENGUIN'S CIRCUS GANG) TO ADVANCE. POSSIBLE ATTACKS INCLUDE PUNCHES, SLIDING ATTACKS, DROP KICKS AND A POWERFUL 360° CAPE SLASH ATTACK WHICH WILL DRAIN BATMAN'S HEALTH BAR. GADGETS TO BE USED INCLUDE A LIMITED NUMBER OF BATARANGS AND A GRAPPLING HOOK. THE HOOK IS USEFUL FOR MANY THINGS: IT CAN TAKE DOWN FLYING ENEMIES, PULL BATMAN UP TO HIGHER LEVELS, LETS HIM CLIMB INTO OPEN WINDOWS AND MORE. HIDDEN IN BACKGROUND ITEMS SOMEWHERE IN THE LEVELS ARE POWER-UPS, INCLUDING HEARTS THAT REFILL THE HEALTH BAR AND EXTRA BATARANGS.

EACH OF THE SIX LEVELS IN THE GAME CONCLUDES WITH A BOSS FIGHT AGAINST ONE OR MORE ESPECIALLY POWERFUL ENEMIES.

THE BATMOBILE IS ARMED WITH MACHINE GUNS AND BAT DISCS, USED TO DISPATCH THE ENEMY BIKES AND CARS IN THE DRIVING LEVEL. THE BATSKIBOAT SECTION IS SIMILAR, EXCEPT THAT THERE ARE NO ENEMIES AND THE ONLY GOAL IS TO COLLECT COINS FOR EXTRA POINTS.</desc>

		<name>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure</name>
		<desc>BILL AND TED ARE TWO SURFER-SPEAKING 1980S HIGH SCHOOL DUDES FROM SAN DIMAS, CALIFORNIA.  AFTER THE EVENTS OF THE FILM BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, THEY SEEM FREE TO BUILD THE BAND THAT WILL ONE DAY UNITE EARTH'S PEOPLE AND BRING ABOUT WORLD PEACE.  EXCEPT...  RUFUS RETURNS FROM THE FUTURE WITH A WARNING THAT SOMEONE HAS WARPED THE TIME CONTINUUM BY KIDNAPPING HISTORICAL FIGURES AND STRANDING THEM IN THE WRONG TIME PERIOD (...SOOO, BASICALLY WHAT BILL AND TED DID IN THE FIRST FILM?)  IT'S UP TO THE BOYS TO SORT OUT THE MESS.

THE PLAYER CONTROLS EITHER BILL OR TED, WHO HAVE SPLIT UP TO TACKLE THE QUEST (ALLOWING EACH TO LEAVE ITEMS TO ASSIST THE OTHER). EACH "MISSION" BEGINS BY CONSULTING A PHONE BOOK OF HISTORICAL FIGURES, AND SPOTTING THE PAGE WHOSE NUMBER HAS CHANGED (A SECOND NUMBER, FLASHING IN RED).  THE PLAYER DIALS THAT NUMBER, AND GUIDES THE PHONE BOOTH THROUGH THE CIRCUITS OF TIME. RUFUS COULD ONLY LEND A PAYPHONE, SO PLAYERS WILL NEED TO PLOT OUT THE SHORTEST PATH TO THEIR DESTINATION, WHILE AVOIDING ANY HAZARDS. EACH CHANGE IN DIRECTION COSTS ONE COIN.

ONCE IN THE TARGET TIME PERIOD, THE PLAYER CONTROLS BILL OR TED THROUGH AN ISOMETRIC VIEW AS THEY SEARCH FOR THE DISPLACED HISTORICAL FIGURE.  THE PLAYER MUST STICK TO A DEFINED PATH TO AVOID FALLING, AND MUST BE CAUTIOUS OF THE LOCALS.  SOME WILL OFFER CLUES OR HELPFUL ITEMS, WHILE OTHERS DEMAND A COIN IF BUMPED INTO.  OTHER LOCALS WILL ACTIVELY CHASE BILL AND TED AND THROW THEM IN JAIL, WHERE THEY MUST USE A SKELETON KEY (IF THEY HAVE ONE) TO ESCAPE. PLAYERS CAN FIND AND COLLECT COINS FOR THE PHONE BOOTH, KEYS FOR THE JAIL, AND DISTRACTIONS (LIKE PUDDING OR TAPE PLAYERS) TO THROW OFF ANY PURSUERS.

THE PLAYER MUST ALSO LOCATE AN ITEM OF "HISTORICAL BAIT," APPROPRIATE TO THE TARGET, TO GET THEM TO FOLLOW. ONCE THE HISTORICAL DUDE HAS BEEN BAITED AND BAGGED, THE PLAYER SWITCHES TO THE OTHER MEMBER OF THE TITULAR DUO TO RESCUE A NEW HISTORICAL CELEBRITY. THE PROCESS REPEATS UNTIL TIME IS CORRECTED.</desc>

DURING THE CONSTRUCTION OF ALTILE, HUMANITY HAS BECOME UNITED AND PEACEFUL. DURING THIS NEW ERA OF PROSPERITY, EARTH DECOMMISSIONS THE ROBOWARRIORS, A FORCE OF HEAVILY ARMED HALF-MAN HALF-ROBOT WAR VEHICLES. BUT FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION, ALIENS CALLING THEMSELVES THE XANTHO EMPIRE AND LEAD BY THE BEING XUR INVADE PLANET ALTILE AND TERRAFORM IT FOR THEIR OWN USES. THE SURVIVORS OF ALTILE SEND OUT A DISTRESS CALL TO EARTH. RECEIVING THIS MESSAGE, THE PEOPLE OF EARTH QUICKLY ACTIVATE THE LATEST AND MOST POWERFUL OF THE ROBOWARRIORS, A MODEL KNOWN AS ZED (Z-TYPE EARTH DEFENSE) AND SEND IT AT TOP SPEED TO ALTILE.

CONTROLLING ZED FROM AN OVERHEAD VIEW, THE PLAYER IS ABLE TO MOVE IN ANY OF 4 DIRECTIONS (UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT), DROP BOMBS AND SHOOT A PROJECTILE WEAPON. THE TERRAIN OF ALTILE IS MADE UP OF MANY OBSTACLES AND THE BOMBS SERVE TO DESTROY THESE AND MAKE PASSAGE FOR ZED. DESTROYING ANY ENEMY OR OBSTACLE MAY YIELD DIFFERENT POWER-UPS WHICH CONTAIN ANY OF 10 DIFFERENT EFFECTS (INCLUDING AMMUNITION AND ENERGY REFILLS) WHICH MAY BE STOCKED AND USED AT ANY TIME FROM THE MENU. OR THE POWER-UPS MAY BE INSTANT-USE REFILLS FOR BOMBS AND ENERGY SUPPLIES.

ADDITIONALLY SOME LEVELS CONTAIN KEYS, WHICH UNLOCK DOORS AND CHALICES WHICH PREVENT THE LEVEL FROM RUNNING ON ENDLESSLY. SECRET AREAS SUCH AS A WELL OF HOPE AND A ROOM OF IDOLS MAY ALSO BE FOUND. ALTOGETHER, THERE ARE EIGHT DIFFERENT "WORLDS" FOR ZED TO CONQUER, CONTAINING NUMEROUS STAGES AND GUARDED BY A VICIOUS BOSS MONSTER.</desc>

THEY CAN ALSO PICK UP SPECIAL ITEMS THAT INCREASE THEIR POINTS, SPEED AND ATTACK POWER. THIS GAME FEATURES 80 LEVELS, ALL-NEW ENEMIES, AND BONUS MINI-GAMES.</desc>

		<desc>BUBBLE BOBBLE IS THE STORY OF TWO HUMANS, BUB AND BOB WHO WANDER INTO THE MYSTERIOUS CAVE OF MONSTERS AND MAGICALLY TURN INTO DINOSAURS. THE ONLY WAY TO TRANSFORM BACK IS TO REACH THE END OF THE CAVE...

BUBBLE BOBBLE IS A PLATFORM GAME, WITH EACH LEVEL BEING A SINGLE SCREEN. THE ENEMIES MUST BE CLEARED FROM A LEVEL TO GO TO THE NEXT ONE. WITH ONE PLAYER CONTROLLING BUB AND THE OTHER CONTROLLING BOB, THE PLAYER CAN JUMP AND COLLECT ITEMS FOR POINTS (SUCH AS FRUIT). THE REAL POWER BUB AND BOB HAVE HOWEVER IS THE ABILITY TO BLOW BUBBLES. THESE BUBBLES CAN BE AS PLATFORMS TO LEAP ON, OR TO TRAP ENEMIES. ENEMIES TRAPPED IN A BUBBLE MUST BE POPPED BY JUMPING INTO THEM, WHEREIN THEY'LL TURN TO FRUIT. ADDITIONALLY, POWER-UPS SOMETIMES FLOAT BY IN BUBBLES. THEY INCLUDE LIGHTNING, WHICH FLIES OUT HORIZONTALLY AT ENEMIES, AND WATER, WHICH DRAGS THE PLAYER AND ENEMIES STRAIGHT DOWN FLOWING OVER PLATFORMS. TAKING TOO LONG TO COMPLETE ANY LEVEL WILL SUMMON BARON VON BLUBBA, WHO WILL FLOAT AROUND THE SCREEN TRYING TO DESTROY THE PLAYER.</desc>

YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU BUMP THE CARS OUT OF THE WAY BEFORE YOU GET BUMPED AND CRASH INTO THE SIDES YOURSELF! YOUR CAR ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO JUMP QUITE HIGH IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH SPEED. THIS IS USEFUL TO JUMP OVER ENEMY CARS IF THERE ARE TOO MANY IN THE WAY, AND MUST ALSO BE USED TO JUMP GAPS IN THE ROADWAY AND OTHER HIGHWAY OBSTACLES.

		<desc>THE MANDARIN HAS KNOCKED OUT IRON MAN AND THE VISION. THIS TIME IT IS PERSONAL.

YOU PLAY AS CAPTAIN AMERICA OR HAWKEYE. IN THE ONE PLAYER MODE, YOU MUST FIGHT YOUR WAY THROUGH VARIOUS THUGS TO RESCUE IRON MAN AND THE VISION. THIS GAME IS A SIDE SCROLLER, SOMEWHAT REMINISCENT OF BIONIC COMMANDO IN WHICH YOU FIGHT THROUGH A LEVEL THEN MOVE TO AN OVERHEAD MAP TO DECIDE WHERE TO GO NEXT. IN BETWEEN LEVELS, WASP GIVES YOU HINTS.

CAPTAIN AMERICA'S ATTACKS ARE: WHEN HE IS STANDING, SHIELD THROW; WHEN HE IS CROUCHING, PUNCH AND WHEN HE IS JUMPING, KICK. ALSO, IF YOU PUSH TWICE IN A DIRECTION, CAP CAN DO A POWERFUL FORWARD CHARGE WITH HIS SHIELD FOR A SHORT DISTANCE.

HAWKEYE'S ATTACKS ARE ALL ARROW SHOTS. HE CAN SHOOT LEFT, RIGHT, UP, UPPER-LEFT OR UPPER-RIGHT.

IF YOU COMPLETE AN AREA WITH ONE CHARACTER THEN COMPLETE IT WITH THE OTHER CHARACTER RIGHT AWAY, YOU CAN PRESS START TO SWITCH BETWEEN CAP OR HAWKEYE. THIS HAS THE ADVANTAGE THAT CAP'S FORWARD CHARGE IS POWERFUL AND BY GRABBING POLES, HE CAN THEN JUMP TO AREAS HAWKEYE CANNOT.

HAWKEYE CAN SHOOT ENEMIES OR TARGETS TOO HIGH FOR CAP TO JUMP UP AND KICK.

IN THE BATTLE MODE, THIS IS A TWO PLAYER, ONE-ON-ONE BATTLE. PLAYER ONE CHOOSES FROM CAPTAIN AMERICA OR HAWKEYE (THE GOOD GUYS) AND PLAYER TWO CHOOSES FROM WIZARD, ULTRON OR CROSSBONES (THE BAD GUYS).

YOU FIGHT EACH OTHER UNTIL ONE PLAYER HAS WON THREE ROUNDS.</desc>

TWO PLAYERS CAN PLAY AGAINST EACH OTHER, OR ONE PERSON CAN PLAY AGAINST A COMPUTER GENERATED OPPONENT. THE ANSWER TO THE PUZZLE IS HIDDEN BY TILES. THE TILES HAVE WORDS DENOTING GAME PRIZES ("MEXICO", "CAMERA", "TELESCOPE", FOR EXAMPLE), AND YOUR OBJECT IS TO FIND THE TWO MATCHING WORDED TILES. EXPOSING TWO AT A TIME, YOUR MEMORY IS TAXED AS MORE PRIZE TILES ARE REVEALED AND THEN COVERED OVER AGAIN.  AS MORE TILES ARE MATCHED, THE HIDDEN PUZZLE IS REVEALED.

		<path>./Cobra Triangle (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Cobra Triangle</name>
		<desc>COBRA TRIANGLE IS A SINGLE-PLAYER BOAT-RACING GAME THAT LETS YOU DO MORE THAN RACE. IT BORROWS THE POWER-UP SYSTEM FROM THE SHOOT 'EM UP GENRE BUT KEEPS THE EMPHASIS MORE ON MANEUVERING THAN SHOOTING. SINCE YOU HAVE A HEALTH METER WITH A DOZEN BARS IN IT, IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT TO DODGE BULLETS UNLESS YOUR HEALTH IS REALLY LOW, BUT YOU SHOULD TRY NOT TO RUN INTO TOO MANY WALLS. IN ORDER TO GET VERY FAR YOU NEED TO MAKE USE OF YOUR POWER-UPS WHICH ARE TURBO FOR BETTER ACCELERATION; FIRE FOR INCREASED FIREPOWER; SPEED FOR INCREASED TOP-SPEED; MISSILE FOR FIRING MISSILES AS WELL AS BULLETS; AND FORCE WHICH MAKES YOU FIRE TONS OF MISSILES AND ALSO MAKES YOU INVINCIBLE FOR A LIMITED TIME. YOU GET ROUGHLY ONE MINUTE TO COMPLETE EACH LEVEL. SPEAKING OF WHICH, THERE ARE 7 TYPES OF LEVELS EACH WITH A DIFFERENT OBJECTIVE:

(1) RACE TO THE FINISH - SHOOT OTHER BOATS ALONG THE WAY TO THE FINISH LINE AND AVOID ENEMIES LIKE TURRETS AND SHARKS. SOME BOATS TOW POWER-UP PODS BEHIND THEM THAT YOU CAN COLLECT AFTER YOU SHOOT THEM. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN YOU FINISH, AND YOU AREN'T TOLD IF YOU GET 1ST OR 2ND OR 3RD PLACE... IT SEEMS THAT THE OTHER BOATS ARE ONLY THERE TO GET IN YOUR WAY. WATCH FOR THE FORK IN THE RIVER; CHOOSING ALTERNATE PATHS TAKES YOU TO THE SAME LEVELS OF THE GAME BUT IN A DIFFERENT ORDER.

(2) COLLECT THE PODS - SIMPLY RACE IN A STRAIGHT PATH WHILE RUNNING OVER RAMPS TO COLLECT PODS AND 1UP'S IN THE AIR. YOU GO ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL WHEN TIME RUNS OUT.

(3) DISPOSE OF MINES - THERE IS A SMALL SQUARE IN THE WATER WITH MINES IN IT. YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO COLLECT THE MINES AND TOW THEM TO ANOTHER SQUARE TO MAKE THEM EXPLODE. OF COURSE, THERE IS AN INVINCIBLE ENEMY BOAT THAT TRIES TO STEAL THEM BACK FROM YOU AND SOME GUYS THAT SHOOT AT YOU. IT TAKES AWHILE SINCE YOU CAN ONLY TOW THEM ONE AT A TIME.

(4) FRY THE MONSTER - THE 'BOSS' LEVELS. YOU FIGHT A SEA-SERPENT, A CRAB, A SHARK, ETC. HE HAS HIS OWN HEALTH DISPLAY RIGHT ABOVE YOURS, BUT IT TENDS TO DEPLETE SLOWER.
(BONUS) SHOOT THE TARGETS - AFTER EVERY BOSS LEVEL YOU GO TO AN AUTO-SCROLLING LEVEL WHERE YOU ARE REWARDED WITH A 1UP PRIZE IF YOU MANAGE TO SHOOT ALL THE TARGETS ALONG THE SHORE WITHOUT MISSING ANY.

(5) GUARD THE PEOPLE - THERE'S A LARGE SQUARE FILLED WITH 8 HELPLESS SWIMMERS, AND FOR SOME REASON THEY'RE ALL ABOUT TO BE KIDNAPPED. OTHER BOATS RACE INTO THE SQUARE AND TOW THEM AWAY UNLESS YOU DESTROY THEIR SHIPS BEFORE THEY GET AWAY. YOU CAN TOW THE PEOPLE BACK INTO THE SQUARE-IF YOU HAVE TIME-WHILE AVOIDING THE SPACESHIPS THAT FIRE STUNNING MISSILES AT YOU. IF YOU HAVE AT LEAST ONE SWIMMER LEFT WHEN THE TIMER RUNS OUT THEN YOU PASS.

(6) REACH THE FINISH - RACE IN A STRAIGHT COURSE WITH PLENTY OF OBSTACLES BUT NO OTHER BOATS. YOU DRIVE UPSTREAM WHILE THE CURRENT DRAGS A HORDE OF LOGS AND WHIRLPOOLS IN YOUR DIRECTION TO STOP YOU. OCCASIONALLY SOME PLANES FLY BY AND SHOOT AT YOU. IF YOU HAPPEN TO DIE IN THIS OR ANY OTHER LEVEL, YOU SIMPLY REAPPEAR ON THE SPOT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE AN EXTRA LIFE. A CONTINUE PUTS YOU BACK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LEVEL YOU WERE ON.

(7) JUMP THE WATERFALL - A LEVEL THAT CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF MOVING RAMPS YOU MUST USE TO JUMP OVER HUGE PITS. MOVING CURRENTS, WHIRLPOOLS, AND THE VIOLATION OF SEVERAL LAWS OF PHYSICS MAKES THIS MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT SOUNDS.

THE ENTIRE GAME CONSISTS OF REPEATING THESE TYPES OF LEVELS FOR A GRAND TOTAL OF 25 STAGES. THE LATER STAGES ARE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE FIRST. THEY'RE FILLED WITH ADDITIONAL OBSTACLES LIKE ICEBERGS, MORE MINES, MORE ENEMIES, AND LONGER COURSES. THERE ARE EVEN SPEED-RAMPS THAT LET YOU TAKE SMALL SHORT-CUTS IN LATER RACING LEVELS.</desc>

		<name>Conflict</name>
		<desc>CONFLICT IS A TURN-BASED, HEX-GRID WARGAME FOR THE NES THAT CAN BE PLAYED BY ONE OR TWO PLAYERS.  IT IS NOT A STRICTLY HISTORICAL WARGAME IN WHICH BATTLES OF THE PAST ARE RECREATED USING REAL-WORLD GEOGRAPHY.  INSTEAD, THE TWO OPPOSING SIDES (BLUE VS. RED) FIGHT IT OUT ACROSS 16 IMAGINARY SCENARIOS WITH ARMIES MODELED ON NATO AND WARSAW PACT FORCES OF THE LATE 1980S. 

THE GAME ALTERNATES BETWEEN TWO MODES OF PLAY: A STRATEGIC/OPERATIONAL SCALE, IN WHICH PLAYERS MOVE THEIR UNITS AROUND THE HEX MAP; AND A TACTICAL COMBAT MODULE FOR RESOLVING UNIT-TO-UNIT COMBATS.  IN THE TACTICAL MODE, HUMAN PLAYERS HAVE THE CHOICE OF EITHER ISSUING ORDERS THEMSELVES OR USING THE "AUTO" MODE WHICH DELEGATES COMMAND TO THE AI.
SPLASH GRAPHICS AND TEXT MESSAGES CONVEY BATTLE RESULTS.

BY CAPTURING TOWNS AND WINNING BATTLES, THE PLAYER GAINS "FAME" POINTS THAT CAN BE USED TO PURCHASE MORE AND BETTER MILITARY HARDWARE.  EVERY SCENARIO ENDS ONLY WHEN THE SAME, SINGLE VICTORY CONDITION IS ACHIEVED BY ONE OF THE TWO SIDES: DESTROY THE OPPOSING SIDE'S MAIN BATTLE TANK UNIT IN COMBAT.

WINNING ANY ONE OF THE FIRST 15 SCENARIOS YIELDS A LETTER OF THE ALPHABET; TOGETHER, THE LETTERS SPELL OUT THE PASSWORD THAT MUST BE ENTERED IN ORDER TO PLAY THE FINAL SCENARIO.</desc>

		<desc>RACE AMERICA IS A 2-CAR CROSS-COUNTRY RACING GAME. EITHER 2 PLAYERS CAN COMPETE ON THE SAME SCREEN, OR THE COMPUTER CAN CONTROL THE SECOND PLAYER. THE GAME PROVIDES EIGHT COLORFUL OPPONENTS TO RACE AGAINST, EACH OF WHOM IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE DISTINCT ADVANTAGES IN A RACE. EACH RACE BEGINS FROM A SIDE-SCROLLING PERSPECTIVE AS THE 2 COMPETITORS SPEED OUT OF THE GATE. AFTER A CERTAIN DISTANCE, THE PERSPECTIVE SHIFTS TO THIRD PERSON AND THE DRIVER IN THE LEAD OCCUPIES THE TOP HALF OF THE SCREEN WHILE THE DRIVER IN SECOND IS RELEGATED TO HALF OF THE LOWER SCREEN. OCCASIONALLY, THE GAME ALSO EMPLOYS AN OVERHEAD VIEW. TO ADD TO THE CHALLENGE, THE GAME'S CARS HAVE 6-SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS WHICH PLAYERS MUST SHIFT USING THE CONTROL PAD, BUT NOT WHILE PRESSING THE GAS BUTTON.</desc>

		<desc>IN THE YEAR 30XX, THE MANKIND HAS EXHAUSTED ALL THE METAL RESOURCES ON THE EARTH, SO THEY HAD TO TRAVEL INTO SPACE IN ORDER TO FIND MORE. THEY FIND A PLANET HIGH IN MINERALS, AND THEY NAME IT SELIM.

BUT SOON THEY DISCOVER THAT THERE IS SOMEONE WATCHING, SPYING ON THEM; IT'S SOME KIND OF ALIEN RACE. THESE ALIENS FIND A HOLE IN THE HUMANS' MAIN COMPUTER AND GET INSIDE IT. THE COMPUTER, PROGRAMMED TO SELF-DESTRUCT IN CASE OF A FAILURE, STARTS ITS COUNTDOWN.

THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO AVOID SELF-DESTRUCTION, WHICH IS ENTERING A 14 DIGIT CODE INTO THE MACHINE; BUT THESE DIGITS ARE HIDDEN IN THE WALLS OF THE CORRIDORS IN THE COMPLEX. YOUR MISSION IS TO FIND THESE LETTERS AND AVOID SELF-DESTRUCTION, ABOARD THE "RED WARRIOR", AND USING YOUR ONLY WEAPON, AN ENERGY BALL.

CRACKOUT IS AN ARKANOID CLONE FOR THE NES, BUT IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST SINGULAR CLONES. YOU'LL HAVE TO DESTROY ALL BLOCKS BUT ALSO THE WALLS SURROUNDING THEM, AS THE 14 LETTERS ARE SPREAD INSIDE THEM, APART FROM KILLING THE ALIEN BOSSES HERE AND THERE. IN YOUR WAY, YOU WILL FIND A BIZARRE MIXTURE OF ENEMIES, FROM ALIEN FORMS TO PARTS OF THE BODY (EYES, LIPS, SKULLS...), WHO WILL MAKE YOUR GAME TOUGHER BY CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF YOUR BALL; BUT ALSO HAPPIER BY DROPPING A SWEET VARIETY OF POWER-UPS SUCH AS THE CHERRIES (EXTRA LIFE), THE CLOCK (THE ENEMIES FREEZE), A ROCKET (TO THROW INTO THE BLOCKS), A FIRE DEVICE (THE BALL FIRES MISSILES), A PARACHUTE (SLOWS THE BALL) AN EXTRA BALL, OR THE WEIRDEST OF THEM ALL, THE SO-CALLED KONAMI MAN, WHO WILL TAKE YOU TO A SECRET PARALLEL COMPLEX WITH DIFFERENT (AND HARDER) LEVELS.</desc>

CRASH 'N THE BOYS: STREET CHALLENGE FEATURES THE SAME BASIC GAMEPLAY ENGINE AND MECHANICS FOUND IN THE REST OF THE KUNIO/NEKKETSU HIGH GAMES. THE PLAYER CONTROLS A CHARACTER IN SIDE-SCROLLING LEVELS AND TRY TO DEFEAT OPPONENTS USING AN ARSENAL OF ATTACKS AND SPECIAL MOVES. UNIQUE TO THIS GAME IS THAT IN ORDER TO CLEAR THE FIVE STAGES, THE PLAYER MUST ALSO ACCOMPLISH A SERIES OF SPORT-THEMED OBJECTIVES. THERE IS A THROWING EVENT, A GOLFING EVENT, SWIMMING, JUMPING, AND ALL-OUT FIGHTING EVENTS, ALL WITH UNIQUE TWISTS INSPIRED BY THE STREET/GANGS THEME OF THE GAME (E.G. THE JUMPING EVENT INVOLVES JUMPING ACROSS THE ROOFTOPS IN THE CITY).

DEPENDING ON THE PLAYER'S PERFORMANCE IN EACH EVENT THEY MAY EARN MEDALS THAT CAN BE EXCHANGED FOR POWER-UPS AND STAT INCREASES. THE GAME SUPPORTS TWO PLAYERS CO-OP OR VS. GAMEPLAY.</desc>

		<desc>IN THE 24TH CENTURY, THE GAME OF BASEBALL IS VERY DIFFERENT. TIRED OF PAYING HUGE PLAYERS SALARIES, THE TEAM OWNERS GOT TOGETHER ONE WEEKEND AND CAME UP WITH A BOLD NEW IDEA, ROBOTS. INDEED THEY RENAMED THEIR LEAGUE THE CYBER LEAGUE AND STOCKED IT WITH FOUR ROBOT TYPES; CYBORG, TANK, FLOATER OR MOTORCYCLE, TO PLAY.  ON AN ORBITAL STADIUM IN SPACE, THESE ROBOTS ALL PLAY A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VARIATION OF THE BASEBALL RULES. HITTING THE BALL AND CATCHING POP-FLYS AND MAKING HOME RUNS ARE ALL THE SAME, BUT WHEN THE CALL OF A PLAY IS IN DISPUTE, THERE ARE NO BASE REFEREES; THE ROBOTS ENGAGE IN A ONE-ON-ONE BATTLE USING ANY WEAPONRY THEY'RE CARRYING.  OF COURSE TO MAKE THINGS INTERESTING, WEAPONRY (AND OTHER ROBOT PARTS AND EQUIPMENT) CAN ONLY BE PURCHASED WITH TEAM FUNDS DURING A TOURNAMENT GAME, AND TEAM FUNDS CAN ONLY BE OBTAINED BY WINS. THUS THE SERIES CLOSER IS ALWAYS SURE TO BE A SOLD OUT GAME.</desc>

		<desc>AFTER AMERICAN FOOTBALL PLAYERS STARTED CHEATING BY USING BIONIC PARTS, THE GAME WAS FORCED TO CHANGE ITS RULES. BY 2022, THE GAME WAS PLAYED NOT BY HUMANS, BUT TWO TEAMS OF SEVEN ROBOTS. TO SPICE THINGS UP, THE USUAL PIG SKIN BALL WAS REPLACED WITH A 350 POUND BOMB.

CYBERBALL BRINGS THIS FAST AND FURIOUS ACTION TO LIFE. GAMEPLAY IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THE REAL SPORT, ALTHOUGH THE 'DOWNS' ARE REPLACED BY THE BOMB'S HEAT GRADUALLY INCREASING TOWARDS 'CRITICAL'. AFTER THIS IT WILL EXPLODE AND POSSESSION WILL BE SWAPPED. THIS IS PREVENTED WHEN YOU CROSS THE 50-YARD LINE, LOSE POSSESSION OR SCORE A TOUCHDOWN, IN WHICH CASES IT RESETS TO 'COOL'. FIELD GOALS AND PUNTS ARE NOT FEATURED - THE ONLY KICK IS THE INITIAL KICK-OFF YOU RECEIVE.

CONTROL PASSES FROM THE QUARTERBACK (THROWER) TO THE INTENDED CATCHER AS SOON AS A PASS IS RELEASED. THE TWO-PLAYER GAME IS CO-OPERATIVE - ON OFFENSE ONE PLAYER PASSES AND THE OTHER RECEIVES</desc>

		<desc>TOM CRUISE'S FILM BROUGHT NASCAR RACING TO THE MASSES, AND MINDSCAPE DID THE SAME FOR GAMES PLAYERS WITH THIS LICENSE. IF YOU MENTALLY CHANGE THE DRIVER NAMES, IT CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS A RECREATION OF REAL NASCAR RACING RATHER THAN A DIRECT RECREATION OF THE FILM. 

YOU PLAY CRUISE'S COLE TRICKLE CHARACTER (HIS NAME, LIKE MANY OF THE OTHERS, IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TO THAT OF A REAL NASCAR RACER OF THE DAY) AGAINST YOUR RIVALS ON 8 TRACKS, BASED ON REAL-LIFE COUNTERPARTS. THE RACES ARE ALL ON OVALS, ALTHOUGH THE EXACT LENGTHS, CORNER TYPES AND GRADIENTS ARE VARIED.  THIS MEANS THAT THE IDEAL RACING LINE ON ONE TRACK CAN PUT YOU INTO THE WALL ON ANOTHER. QUALIFYING IS INCORPORATED ALONGSIDE THE RACES THEMSELVES.

FROM TIMES TO TIMES YOU'LL HAVE TO PULL INTO THE PIT STOP AREA. WHEN DOING SO, YOU CONTROL THE FIVE MEMBERS OF THE PIT CREW. LOOSING TIME ON PIT WILL MAKE YOU LOOSE POSITIONS AT THE RACE. THE OTHER RACERS, HOWEVER, NEVER PIT.

THE NES VERSION HAS 3RD-PERSON PERSPECTIVE ONLY.</desc>

IN DEJA VU YOUR CHARACTER WAKES UP IN A TOILET STALL OF A SLEAZY PUB WITH NO MEMORY OF WHO YOU ARE OR WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, YOU SOON STUMBLE UPON A VERY DEAD CORPSE UPSTAIRS WITH THREE BULLETS BURIED IN HIM. SURE ENOUGH, YOU FIND THERE'S A GUN IN YOUR POCKET WITH THREE BULLETS MISSING.

THE MAIN TERRORIST, HANS, IS AFTER THE MONEY LOCKED AWAY IN A SAFE ON THE 30TH FLOOR. HIS HACKER, THEO, IS SLOWLY BREAKING THE LOCKS INTO THE VAULT. IT'S UP TO MCCLAIN TO STOP THEM. DIE HARD FOR THE NINTENDO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS A LOT DIFFERENT TO ITS OTHER COUNTERPARTS. THE GAME IS PLAYED FROM A TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE, RATHER THAN THE 1ST-/3RD-PERSON PERSPECTIVE.

THERE ARE 40 TERRORISTS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING, AND THE TASK IS TO CLEAR EACH FLOOR OF TERRORISTS. THE STAIRWELL, AIR DUCT OR THE EXPRESS ELEVATOR IS USED TO TRAVEL ONLY TO FLOORS 31-35. THESE ARE FREELY ACCESSIBLE AT ANY TIME, DOING AWAY WITH LINEARITY, AND MORE FLOORS ARE UNLOCKED IN "ADVANCED" MODE). AT THE START OF THE GAME, JOHN CAN ONLY USE HIS FISTS TO DEAL WITH FOES, BUT AFTER BRINGING DOWN SOME TERRORISTS, SEVERAL WEAPONS BECOME AVAILABLE, INCLUDING THE PISTOL, MACHINE GUN, C-4 EXPLOSIVES, ROCKET LAUNCHER, AND FLASH BANGS, USING THEIR WEAPONS AGAINST THEM. WHEN HIT BY THESE TERRORISTS, JOHN LOSES SOME LIFE, BUT IT CAN BE RESTORED BY COLLECTING SODA CANS AND MED-KITS. THE GAME ENDS WHEN ALL LIFE IS LOST. 

ONE INTERESTING ASPECT OF THE GAME ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO LISTEN TO HANS SHOUTING ORDERS TO HIS GUARDS THROUGH A TWO-WAY RADIO. ALSO NOTABLE IS THE "FOOT METER". IT STARTS OUT FULL, BUT WILL EVENTUALLY DECREASE IF JOHN STEPS ON SHATTERED GLASS OR RUNS AROUND AT A FASTER SPEED. IF THE METER IS EMPTY, HE WILL WALK MUCH SLOWER THAN WITH A FULL METER. THIS MAY HAVE BEEN ADDED IN TUNE WITH THE FILM, WHERE THE MAIN CHARACTER JOHN MCCLAIN'S FEET END UP IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE NEAR THE END. PARTS OF THE ENVIRONMENTS ARE DESTRUCTIBLE, MOST NOTABLY VENDING MACHINES (RECEIVE FREE SODA), GLASS WALLS AND WINDOWS. NOT ALL PARTS OF THE ENVIRONMENT ARE SHOWN ON THE SCREEN ALL THE TIME - A FOG OF WAR APPEARS TO SHROUD NEARBY AREAS IN DARKNESS.

THE MISSIONS ARE TIME LIMITED. THERE ABOUT FOUR MINUTES BEFORE ONE OF THE SIX LOCKS ARE OPENED (SHOWN IN THE STATUS SCREEN), BUT MORE TIME CAN BE GAINED BY DESTROYING THE MAIN COMPUTER ON THE FOURTH LEVEL. ONCE ALL THE LOCKS HAVE BEEN OPENED, THERE ARE ONLY A FEW MINUTES TO ESCAPE. ONCE THIS TIME EXPIRES, THE GAME ENDS.

LIKE ITS COUNTERPARTS, THE GAME FEATURES CINEMATIC SEQUENCES, WHICH CHANGE THE STORY DEPENDING ON WHICH ACTIONS ARE TAKEN.</desc>

IN FACT, THE GAME BEGINS WITH A DIGITIZED SAMPLE OF THAT QUOTE. THE GAME PLAY CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF SIDE-SCROLLING ACTION. DIRTY HARRY CAN PUNCH AND KICK THE COPIOUS THUGS THAT ASSAULT HIM USING THEIR OWN FISTS, GUNS, BASEBALL BATS, NETS, AND DYNAMITE. THE HERO CAN ALSO PULL IS .44 AND AIM IT IN 5 DIRECTIONS IN ORDER TO PICK OFF ENEMIES, BUT THE AMMO IS LIMITED. FURTHER, DIRTY HARRY HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER TOOLS AT HIS DISPOSAL, PROVIDED HE COLLECTS THEM.

THIS IS NOT A ONE-WAY SIDE-SCROLLER, HOWEVER. THERE ARE SOME ADVENTURE ELEMENTS AS WELL, SUCH AS BEING ABLE TO WALK THROUGH ALLEYS TO OTHER STREETS AND GOING THROUGH DOORS TO ENTER BUILDING. ENTERING BUILDINGS PROVIDES EVEN GREATER CHALLENGES, LIKE SNAKES AND LASER FLOORING. DIRTY HARRY EVEN TAKES THE FIGHT DOWN TO THE SEWER.</desc>

AO LONGO DO CAMINHO, MARIO DEVE SE ESQUIVAR DE UM FLUXO CONSTANTE DE BARRIS, BOLAS DE FOGO "VIVAS" E MOLAS. EMBORA NÃO SEJA TÃO PODEROSO COMO EM OUTROS JOGOS FUTUROS, MARIO PODE ENCONTRAR UM MARTELO QUE LHE PERMITE, POR UM PERÍODO LIMITADO DE TEMPO, DESTRUIR OS BARRIS E BOLAS DE FOGO.

THE NES VERSION OFFERED NEW STAGES, NEW MOVES AND ILLUSTRATED CUT-SCENES, AS WELL AS A NEW FINAL BOSS AND A NEW ENDING. UNLIKE THE FIRST NES GAME, IT OFFERED 2-PLAYER CO-OP GAMEPLAY WITH THE OPTION TO TURN OFF THE FRIENDLY FIRE.

		<name>Dragon Warrior III</name>
		<desc>DRAGON WARRIOR III IS THE CONCLUDING GAME OF THE FIRST DRAGON QUEST/DRAGON WARRIOR TRILOGY, AND ITS STORY TAKES US BACK TO THE TIME PERIOD OF THE LEGENDARY ERDRICK (ALSO KNOWN AS LOTO), THE ANCESTOR OF THE FIRST GAME'S HERO. YOU ARE THE SON OF A POWERFUL WARRIOR ORTEGA, SKILLFUL IN PHYSICAL COMBAT AND SPELLCASTING. YOUR FATHER WENT OUT TO FIGHT THE EVIL BARAMOS, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE APPEARANCE OF MONSTERS IN YOUR REGION, AND NEVER RETURNED. YOU ARE SENT BY THE KING ON A QUEST TO CONTINUE YOUR FATHER'S BRAVE DEEDS AND TO DEFEAT BARAMOS.

DRAGON WARRIOR III IS A TOP-DOWN ROLE-PLAYING GAME WHERE YOU TRAVEL AROUND THE OVERWORLD, CAVES, CASTLES, CITIES AND OTHER LOCATIONS WHILE BATTLING RANDOM ENCOUNTERS, BUYING EQUIPMENT, AND TALKING TO PEOPLE. YOU AND YOUR PARTY MEMBERS RECEIVE EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY BEAT UP MONSTERS AND LEVEL UP WITH ENOUGH EXPERIENCE, INCREASING THEIR STATS. THE GAME FEATURES A DAY/NIGHT CYCLE - AS YOU TRAVEL, DAY SLOWLY CHANGES TO NIGHT AND VICE VERSA; SHOPS ARE TYPICALLY CLOSED AT NIGHT. 

YOU BEGIN WITH CONTROL OF JUST THE MAIN CHARACTER BUT CAN QUICKLY RECRUIT THREE MORE MEMBERS TO YOUR PARTY. DURING THE GAME YOU CAN CHOOSE TO DROP YOUR CURRENT CHARACTERS AND RECRUIT OTHERS AT ANY TIME. THE RECRUITABLE CHARACTERS ARE DIVIDED INTO SIX CLASSES: SOLDIER, FIGHTER, MERCHANT, GOOF-OFF, PILGRIM AND WIZARD.

THE GAME HAS A UNIQUE JOB SYSTEM, GIVING YOU THE ABILITY TO SWITCH YOUR HIRED CHARACTERS' CLASSES AFTER THEY HAVE ACHIEVED AT LEAST LEVEL 20 IN THEIR BASE CLASS. CHARACTERS CAN SWITCH TO THE OTHER BEGINNING CLASSES, AS WELL AS THE SAGE CLASS, WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THE BEGINNING. WHEN A CHARACTER SWITCHES CLASSES, THEY LOSE ALL EARNED EXPERIENCE POINTS, AND HALF OF THEIR STATS, BUT RETAIN ALL OF THE ABILITIES OF THE PREVIOUS CLASS. IN THIS WAY, YOU CAN CREATE POWERFUL COMBINATION CHARACTERS THAT ARE ABLE TO CAST SPELLS AND FIGHT EFFECTIVELY.</desc>

NOW, DRAGONLORD STOLE THE BALL OF LIGHT, AND YOUR MISSION IS TO RECOVER IT AND TO RESTORE PEACE IN THE WORLD.

IN DRAGON WARRIOR, YOU MOVE YOUR CHARACTER AROUND IN A TOP-DOWN WORLD. IN CITIES AND PALACES YOU CAN TALK TO PEOPLE, REST IN INNS AND BUY STUFF IN SHOPS. THERE'S A VARIETY OF WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT AND ARMOR TO BUY. 

WHEN WANDERING AROUND IN THE WILDERNESS, YOU OCCASIONALLY ENCOUNTER ENEMIES, AND FIGHT THEM FROM 1ST PERSON PERSPECTIVE. COMBAT IS TURN BASED: YOU SELECT MENU OPTIONS WHILE FIGHTING - YOU CAN ATTACK WITH YOUR WEAPON, CAST A SPELL (USING UP SOME OF YOUR MAGIC ENERGY), USE AND ITEM OR TRY TO RUN. KILLING MONSTERS GIVES YOU EXPERIENCE, AND, AS IS TYPICAL FOR RPGS, YOU LEVEL UP AND IMPROVE YOUR STATS WHEN YOU GAIN ENOUGH EXPERIENCE. 

LIKE IN LATER RPGS, YOU HAVE LIMITED HIT POINTS, LOSE THEM WHEN YOU ARE ATTACKED BY ENEMIES, AND DIE WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF THEM. WHEN YOUR CHARACTER DIES IN A BATTLE, HE IS AUTOMATICALLY RESTORED IN A NEARBY TOWN.</desc>

ONCE AGAIN, DIRK IS UP TO RESCUE PRINCESS DAPHNE FROM THE EVIL DRAGON SINGE. TO DO SO, DIRK WILL USE WEAPONS SUCH KNIFES, AXES, FIRE BALLS, ETC, THROWN AGAINST DRAGONS, BATS, SNAKES, THE LIZARD KING (WHO WILL STEAL GOLD FROM HIM), AMONG OTHER FOES. HE WILL ALSO DO A LOT OF JUMPING AND DUCKING TO AVOID THREATS ALONG HIS WAY, SUCH AS FALLING BRIDGES, PRESSES, SPIKES AND HOLES ON THE FLOOR. TO COMPLETE A STAGE, ALL HE HAS TO DO IS TO GET TO THE END OF IT ALIVE.

AT THE END OF SOME STAGES, DIRK WILL TAKE AN ELEVATOR THAT WILL LEAD HIM TO OTHER STAGES. THE ELEVATOR MAKES SHORT STOPS AT SOME PLATFORMS, AND YOU HAVE TO DECIDE IF DIRK WILL JUMP ONTO THAT PLATFORM OR ANOTHER. IF  HE TAKES THE WRONG PLATFORM, HE MAY GO BACK TO A PREVIOUS STAGE AND GO THROUGH IT ALL OVER AGAIN. FROM THE ELEVATOR DIRK CAN ALSO GET TO A BONUS LEVEL, THE LIZARD KING'S THRONE ROOM, WHERE HE CAN TRY TO RECOVER THE GOLD THE KING HAS STOLEN FROM HIM.

ALTHOUGH DIRK HAS A LIFE BAR, HE WILL INSTANTLY DIE IF TAKES DAMAGE FROM THE MOST OF THE THREATS. HE ALSO HAS A "CANDLE BAR", WHICH IS USED (BY PRESSING THE START BUTTON) TO LIGHT UP DARK PLACES AND TO DISCOVER HIDDEN ITEMS AT SPECIFIC LOCATIONS.

THE GAME CAN BE PLAYED BY 2 PLAYERS TAKING TURNS. THE PAL VERSION HAS FASTER GAMEPLAY, ADDITIONAL ENEMIES (INCLUDING LEVEL BOSSES), DEATH ANIMATIONS AND SPLASH SCREENS IN BETWEEN THE LEVELS.</desc>

		<desc>THE DUDES WITH ATTITUDES ARE ON A MISSION TO UNCOVER BURIED JEWELS ON CARIBBEAN ISLANDS. THESE DUDES BEING REFERRED TO ARE EMOTICON LOOKING CHARACTERS WHO GO BY THE NAMES OF DUDE, HAPPY, PATCH, BOZO, BABE AND FOXY. IN THIS PUZZLE GAME, YOU CONTROL ONE OF THE DUDES AS THEY BOUNCE BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE SCREEN TRYING TO ACQUIRE THE JEWELS ON THE PLAYFIELD. THE ONE CAVEAT IS THAT YOUR DUDE HAS TO MATCH THE COLOR OF THE JEWEL HE OR SHE IS TRYING TO COLLECT. TO BECOME THE CORRECT COLOR TO SNATCH UP THE JEWELS, YOU HAVE TO BOUNCE ACROSS A PAINT CAN (AN ATTITUDE CONVERTER) THAT WILL CHANGE YOUR DUDE TO THAT OF THE SAME COLOR AS THE PAINT CAN. THE OBJECT IN EACH PUZZLE IS TO RETRIEVE ALL THE TREASURES IN A ROOM WITHOUT THEIR CHARACTER FALLING PREY TO THE VARIOUS ENEMIES IN ROOMS OR RUNNING OUT OF TIME. THIS IS AN UNLICENSED GAME.</desc>

		<desc>ALL WEEKEND BALLPLAYERS KNOW SOFTBALL'S NO JOKE, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE A LITTLE FUN WITH IT. AND WHEN YOU STEP UP TO THE PLATE IN THIS CART YOU'LL FIND THE WACKIEST BUNCH OF PLAYERS TO EVER HIT A SOFTBALL DIAMOND!

PLAY SEVEN INNING FAST OR SLOW-PITCH GAMES. IN ONE PLAYER MODE, YOU FACE THE COMPUTER IN A FIVE-GAME ELIMINATION TOURNAMENT. WIN THEM ALL, AND YOU EARN THE RIGHT TO CHALLENGE THE AWESOME AMAZONS - ALL-STAR SOFTBALL'S ALL-TIME CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM. OF COURSE, YOU AND A FRIEND CAN PLAY EACH OTHER IN A HEAD-TO-HEAD CONTEST.

THERE ARE NO PRESET BALL CLUBS SO YOU RECRUIT 10-MEMBER SQUAD FROM A ROSTER OF 60 WEIRD PLAYERS. LOOK FOR PLAYERS WHO HAVE STRONG BASIC BASEBALL SKILLS SUCH AS ARM STRENGTH AND SPEED. BUT TO WIN ON SOME OF THE TRICKY FIELDS YOU'LL ALSO NEED PLAYERS WITH MORE UNUSUAL SKILLS - SUCH AS CLIMBING FENCES, DIVING INTO WATER, AND FLYING AT NIGHT

IN FAST PITCH, YOU HURL THAT BABY IN THREE SPEEDS. BUT STAY ALERT, BASE RUNNERS STEAL AND BATTERS BUNT. IN SLOW PITCH, YOU CAN LOB THE BALL SHORT OR LONG. YOU CAN ALSO MAKE YOUR PITCHES CURVE RIGHT OR LEFT.FIELDING THE BALL TAKES PRACTICE, BUT YOUR GUYS CAN ALSO DIVE FOR HARD GROUNDERS AND LEAP UP TO SNARE LINE SHOTS. FOR QUICK DOUBLE PLAYS, INFIELDERS CAN TAG A BASE THEN THROW THE BALL.

WITH SIX SOFTBALL FIELDS TO CHOOSE FROM, INCLUDING THE SANDLOT, THE CLIFF, AND A PROFESSIONAL FIELD, THERE'S SOME GREAT ACTION. GET READY TO TAKE YOURSELF OUT TO THE SOFTBALL PARK.</desc>

		<path>./Elevator Action (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Elevator Action</name>
		<desc>YOU ARE AGENT 17 (CODENAME: "OTTO"). YOUR MISSION IS TO SECURE ALL TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS FROM A SECURITY BUILDING AND ESCAPE IN THE GETAWAY CAR, LOCATED IN THE BASEMENT OF THE BUILDING.

ENEMIES SPIES ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE 30-FLOOR BUILDING AND THEY HAVE ONLY ONE MISSION: EXECUTE AGENT 17 AT ALL COSTS. THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS IN WHICH AGENT 17 CAN KILL THEM:

1. SHOOTING THEM WITH HIS GUN.
2. KICKING THEM BY JUMPING ONTO THEM.
3. SHOOTING A LIGHT ON THE CEILING WHILE IN AN ELEVATOR, DROPPING THE LIGHT ONTO ONE OF THEM.
4. CRUSHING THEM WITH AN ELEVATOR.

WHENEVER A LIGHT HAS BEEN DROPPED, THE HALLWAYS WILL BE DARK FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, MAKING THE ENEMY SPIES HARDER TO SEE. THE SAME HOLDS TRUE FOR HALLWAYS THAT ARE ALREADY DARK.

WHILE OTTO IS IN AN ELEVATOR, HE WILL HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OF IT BY MOVING UP OR DOWN. AGENT 17 CAN STILL GET KILLED IF HE'S ALREADY IN AN ELEVATOR IF A BULLET'S TRAJECTORY IS AIMED AT IT.. WHEN OTTO IS NOT IN AN ELEVATOR, IT WILL MOVE FROM FLOOR TO FLOOR AUTOMATICALLY, EVEN WHEN ENEMY SPIES ARE IN IT. OTTO IS ABLE TO LEAP OVER THE ELEVATOR GAPS, BUT HE MUST BE AS CLOSE TO THE EDGE AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT FALLING OFF IN ORDER TO MAKE THE JUMP SAFELY. IF THERE IS AN ELEVATOR CABLE IN THE WAY, HOWEVER, IT WILL BLOCK HIM, CAUSING HIM TO FALL. 

JUST BECAUSE THE GAME IS CALLED ELEVATOR ACTION DOESN'T MEAN THAT ELEVATORS ARE THE ONLY MEANS OF TRAVEL. THERE ARE ALSO ESCALATORS WHICH YOU CAN RIDE UP OR DOWN, USEFUL IF YOU WANT TO AVOID GUNFIRE AND DON'T HAVE TIME TO JUMP.

OTTO MUST GO INTO THE ROOMS WITH RED DOORS TO COLLECT THE TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS. IF HE TRIES TO GET TO HIS CAR WITHOUT GETTING ALL THE DOCUMENTS, HE CANNOT ESCAPE AND MUST GO BACK AND COLLECT THE REMAINING DOCUMENTS. ONCE HE HAS ALL THE DOCUMENTS AND DRIVES AWAY, HE THEN PROCEEDS TO THE NEXT BUILDING.

IF OTTO TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO COLLECT THE DOCUMENTS, THE ALARM WILL GO OFF, AND HE WILL HAVE TROUBLE CONTROLLING THE ELEVATORS, WHICH WILL TAKE TIME TO REACT. BAD GUYS WILL BE ESPECIALLY AGGRESSIVE. THE ALARM DOESN'T GO OFF WHEN OTTO LOSES A LIFE, IT ONLY RESETS AFTER FINISHING A BUILDING. BESIDES DUCKING, BAD GUYS MAY ALSO DROP THEMSELVES AND LAY FLAT ON THE FLOOR. IT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR OTTO TO SHOOT BAD GUYS WHEN THEY DO THIS. ALSO, OTTO CANNOT DUCK WHEN IN AN ELEVATOR.</desc>

		<name>Eliminator Boat Duel</name>
		<desc>ELIMINATOR BOAT DUEL IS A RUTHLESS ONE ON ONE BOAT RACING GAME THAT CAN EITHER BE PLAYED AGAINST THE COMPUTER OR A HUMAN OPPONENT. THE RACES TAKE PLACE IN SUCH SETTINGS AS OPEN WATER, THE BAYOU, AND EVEN INDUSTRIAL WATER DISTRICTS. EACH BOAT RACE CONSISTS OF SEVERAL SECTIONS. FIRST, THERE IS THE STARTING LINE -- WHERE YOU CAN EXPECT A $2000 FINE FOR A FALSE START -- WHICH BEGINS WITH A BRIEF SIDE-SCROLLING RACE WITH SPLIT-SCREEN BACKGROUND SCROLLING, A COMMON CHARACTERISTIC OF LATER NES TITLES. THE PRIMARY SECTIONS OF THE RACES ARE A MIXTURE OF TOP-DOWN RACING AND 3RD-PERSON RACING FROM A PERSPECTIVE BEHIND THE BOATS. THE TOP-DOWN SECTIONS ARE THE MOST INVOLVED WITH NUMEROUS THREATS TO AVOID SUCH AS ALLIGATORS, SHARKS, AND WHIRLPOOLS THAT WILL TURN YOU THE WRONG WAY. THERE ARE ALSO RAMPS TO JUMP OFF OF, PEOPLE IN NEED OF RESCUE, NITRO SPEED BOOST POWERUPS, AND RAW CASH BONUSES TO COLLECT. THE 3RD PERSON SEGMENTS HAVE LESS DETAIL AND DISTRACTION BUT MOVE MUCH QUICKER AS THE 2 PLAYERS VIE TO STAY WITHIN THE FLAGS, COLLECT SPEED BOOSTS, AND HIT THE OCCASIONAL RAMP. SPEED BOOSTS ARE COLLECTED ALONG THE WAY AND CAN BE USED AT THE PLAYER'S DISCRETION TO GAIN A MUCH-NEEDED EDGE AT ANY POINT DURING THE RACE.

A RACE FINISHES BACK IN THE SIDE-SCROLLING VIEW. IF THE BOATS COME THROUGH TOO CLOSE TOGETHER, THE BIKINI MODELS ON THE SIDELINES ACT CONFUSED AND REQUEST A SLO-MO REPLAY, WHICH THE GAME SUBSEQUENTLY PROVIDES. PRIZE MONEY IS THEN AWARDED WITH WHICH THE PLAYERS MAY USE TO REPAIR AND UPGRADE THEIR BOATS WITH FASTER ENGINES, TOUGHER HULLS, AND BETTER STEERING.</desc>

		<path>./Dance Aerobics (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Family Trainer 3 : Aerobics Studio</name>
		<desc>DANCE AEROBICS IS A CHANCE TO GET FIT BY FOLLOWING THE MOVEMENTS OF AN AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR.

PLAYERS USE SIDE B OF THE POWER PAD ACCESSORY (A FLOOR MAT WITH 12 PADS IN A 4 BY 3 GRID) TO FOLLOW THE MOVEMENTS OF AN AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR. TO SUCCEED THE PLAYER MUST PRESS THE PADS WITH THERE FEET AND HANDS AT THE SAME TIME AS THE ON SCREEN AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR. ANY MISSED MOVEMENTS ARE RECORDED ON A MISTAKE COUNTER AND 10 MISSED MOVEMENTS WILL FAIL THE LEVEL. THE ROUTINES (A SET OF REPEATED MOVEMENTS) START SLOW AND SIMPLE WITH A BIT OF NO-PENALTY PRACTISE TIME HOWEVER AS THE PLAYER GETS BETTER THE ROUTINES GET MORE COMPLEX WITH LESS PRACTICES TIME. EACH LEVEL HAS A SET NUMBER OF ROUTINES THAT INCREASE WITH EACH LEVEL FROM 4 AT THE START TO A TOTAL OF 32 ON THE FINAL LEVEL (LEVEL 7). AT THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF EACH LEVEL THE PLAYER WILL GET A PASS STAMP WHICH THEY CAN ENTER LATER TO SKIP THAT LEVEL.

THE SECOND MODE IS MINI-GAMES CALLED PAD ANTICS THAT INCLUDES TUNE UP, MAT MELODIES, AND DITTO. TUNE UP IS WHERE THE 10 OF THE 12 PADS (THE CENTRE 2 BEEN WHERE THE PLAYER STANDS) MAKES A MUSICAL NOTE (DO, RE, ME ETC.). MAT MELODIES IS LIKE TUNE UP BUT THE PLAYER IS GIVEN A SONG TO PLAY AND THE PLAYER MUST MEMORISE TO PLAY THE NOTES AS THEY COME AS EVERY MISSED NOTE LOSES POINTS, GET OVER 80 POINTS (FROM STARTING AT 100) AND PROGRESS TO A HARDER SONG.  DITTO IS LIKE A ONE-PLAYER TWISTER LIKE GAME WHERE THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PLACE YOU HANDS AND FEET WHERE INDICATED ON THE MAT ON THE SCREEN WITH 1 OR 2 POINTS SCORED WITH EVERY SUCCESSFUL POSITION.

THE THIRD MODE IS AEROBICS STUDIOS.  AEROBICS STUDIOS IS THE SAME AS THE MAIN GAME BUT WITH ONLY 4 LEVELS (STUDIO 5,  STUDIO 10, STUDIO 15, AND STUDIO 20) ALL UNLOCKED AT THE START, A SCORE THAT COUNTS DOWN FROM 100 WITH MISTAKES (OR UP IF THE PLAYER IS DOING WELL), NO PROGRESSION IN LEVELS, AND THE PLAYER CAN CONTINUE PLAYING EVEN IF THERE SCORE IS AT 0.</desc>

		<name>Faxanadu</name>
		<desc>THIS 2D PLATFORMER HAS ELEMENTS OF ROLE-PLAYING AND ADVENTURE IN ADDITION TO SIDE-SCROLLING ACTION.

THE STORY IS A CLASSIC ONE OF GOOD VERSUS EVIL.  DISASTER STRIKES THE ONCE PEACEFUL ELF TOWN OF EOLIS. THE SKY RAINS METEORITES UPON THE WORLD TREE - WILD ANIMALS AND EVIL MONSTERS TERRORIZE THE CITIZENS - THE WATER SUPPLY FROM THE WELLS IS DWINDLING - PLANTS ARE WITHERING - PEOPLE ARE DYING. ONLY YOU CAN RESTORE PEACE TO THE LAND BY CONQUERING THE EVIL ONE, WHO LIVES IN THE EVIL PLACE.

THERE ARE MANY PLACES YOU MUST VISIT DURING YOUR QUEST INCLUDING THE MEDIEVAL TOWN, WHERE YOU BEGIN, COUNTRY VILLAGES, FORTRESSES, CAVES, AND GLOOMY BOGS - EACH WITH ITS OWN AMBIANCE AND MUSICAL SCORE.  YOU WILL BE TALKING WITH THE VILLAGERS, COLLECTING GOLD TO BUY WEAPONS, ARMOR AND OTHER OBJECTS, JUMPING OVER OBSTACLES AND USING ITEMS.  ATTACK ZOMBIES, DWARVES, GIANT SNAKES, WYVERNS, EVIL GNOMES, OR ONE-EYED ONE-FOOTED THINGS WITH A LARGE COLLECTION OF SWORDS AND DAGGERS OR ZAP THEM WITH A MAGIC SPELL. 

AS AREAS ARE COMPLETED BY DEFEATING ENEMIES, YOUR CHARACTER RISES UP IN LEVELS AND ACHIEVES A NEW RANK WHICH IS TIED DIRECTLY TO THE RESTORE PASSWORD (CALLED A MANTRA IN THE GAME). THE HIGHER YOUR RANK, THE MORE GOLD YOU START OUT WITH.  SAVING A GAME CAN ONLY BE DONE IN A SHRINE OR TEMPLE WITH A PRIEST.  THIS IS ALSO WHERE YOU ARE TRANSPORTED WHEN YOU RESTART THE GAME - OR IF YOU DIE.</desc>

		<name>Felix the Cat</name>
		<desc>FELIX THE CAT IS A PLATFORMER BASED ON THE FAMOUS CARTOON CHARACTER.

THE PROFESSOR HAS KIDNAPPED KITTY, FELIX GIRLFRIEND, TRYING TO EXCHANGE HER FOR FELIX' MAGIC BAG. NATURALLY, FELIX IS NOT GOING TO LET HIMSELF BE BLACKMAILED, AND INSTEAD SETS OUT TO FREE KITTY. 

THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF LEVELS. 

1. TYPICAL PLATFORMING LEVELS IN WHICH FELIX HAS TO MAKE HIS WAY TO THE EXIT WHILE JUMPING ABOUT OBSTACLES AND CHASMS, KILLING ENEMIES USING DIFFERENT WEAPONS.

SWIMMING LEVELS IN WHICH FELIX RIDES A FLOAT OR ON THE BACK OF A DOLPHIN.

LEVELS THAT TAKE PLACE ENTIRELY UNDER WATER.

FLYING LEVELS THAT PUT FELIX IN CONTROL OF DIFFERENT FLYING DEVICES, SUCH AS A PLANE, A HOT-AIR BALLOON OR AN UMBRELLA.

THROUGHOUT ALL LEVELS, FELIX CAN COLLECT CAT SYMBOLS TO IMPROVE HIS WEAPONS. AFTER COLLECTING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CAT SYMBOLS, MILK BOTTLES OR HEARTS WILL APPEAR. HEARTS IMPROVE FELIX' CURRENT WEAPON. WHAT TYPES OF WEAPON FELIX CAN USE, DEPENDS ON WHAT TYPE OF LEVEL HE IS IN. THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT WEAPONS RANGING FROM A BOXING GLOVE TO MOTORCYCLES TO TANKS TO SPACESHIPS. ALL WEAPONS THAT ARE BETTER THAN THE STANDARD WEAPON HAVE AN ENERGY BAR THAT DIMINISHES OVER TIME AND CAN BE REFILLED BY COLLECTING MILK BOTTLES. GETTING HIT BY AN ENEMY DECREASES THE LEVEL OF FELIX' CURRENT WEAPON. IF HE GETS HIT WHILE CARRYING THE STANDARD WEAPON, HE LOSES A LIFE.

THE GAME BOY VERSION PLAYS VIRTUALLY IDENTICALLY TO THE NES VERSION, BUT FEATURES LESS LEVELS.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy</name>
		<desc>HIRONOBU SAKAGUCHI'S FINAL FANTASY... THE FIRST OF ONE OF THE LONGEST ROLE-PLAYING GAME SERIES KNOWN TO MANKIND. FINAL FANTASY IS THE GAME FOR THE NES CONSOLE THAT STARTED IT ALL.

THE WORLD IS VEILED IN DARKNESS. WINDS DON'T BLOW, THE SEAS ARE STORMY, AND THE EARTH ROTS. ALL PEOPLE CAN HOPE FOR IS THAT THE ANCIENT PROPHECY WILL BE FINALLY FULFILLED. "WHEN THE WORLD IS VEILED IN DARKNESS, FOUR WARRIORS WILL COME..." AND INDEED, THEY COME - THE FOUR CHARACTERS YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY CHOSEN. THEIR FIRST QUEST IS TO FREE A PRINCESS FROM THE EVIL GARLAND, AND THEN THE REAL JOURNEY BEGINS...

FINAL FANTASY IS PLAYED WITH AN ADVENTURING PARTY RATHER THAN WITH A SINGLE CHARACTER. BEFORE THE GAME STARTS, THE PLAYER CHOOSES FOUR CHARACTERS FROM SIX DIFFERENT CLASSES: FIGHTER, THIEF, BLACK BELT, WHITE MAGE, RED MAGE, AND BLACK MAGE. WHICH FOUR CLASSES THE PLAYER CHOOSES FOR HIS CHARACTERS IS ENTIRELY UP TO HIM. HE ALSO GIVES THE CHARACTERS NAMES. 

IN THE GAME, THE PARTY WALKS AROUND IN A TOP-DOWN WORLD, VISITS CITIES, CAVES, PALACES AND OTHER PLACES TO BUY EQUIPMENT, REST AND GET HINTS AND NEW QUESTS, AND FIGHTS BADDIES WHEN THEY ARE ENCOUNTERED. FINAL FANTASY USES A TURN-BASED COMBAT SYSTEM; THE ATB (ACTIVE-TIME BATTLE) SYSTEM FROM THE LATER INSTALLMENTS IS NOT USED. IN BATTLE, THE PLAYER GIVES EACH CHARACTER IN ORDER A COMMAND (ATTACK A PARTICULAR ENEMY, CAST A SPELL, USE AN ITEM, OR TRY TO RUN.) THEN THE CHARACTERS AND THE ENEMIES ACT IN A RANDOM ORDER. ATTACKED ENEMIES AND PARTY MEMBERS LOSE HIT POINTS, DYING WHEN THEY REACH ZERO HP. WHEN ALL THE ENEMIES ARE DEFEATED, LIVING PARTY MEMBERS RECEIVE EXPERIENCE, EVENTUALLY GAINING A LEVEL AND IMPROVING THEIR STATS WHEN ENOUGH EXPERIENCE IS ACCUMULATED. SLAIN PARTY MEMBERS CAN BE REVIVED IN TOWNS FOR A PRICE. 

SPELLS ARE BOUGHT IN CITIES IN SPECIAL SHOPS. THE SPELLS ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO CATEGORIES - WHITE MAGIC AND BLACK MAGIC. WHITE MAGES CAN ONLY USE WHITE MAGIC, BLACK MAGES CAN ONLY USE BLACK MAGIC, AND RED MAGES CAN USE BOTH. CASTING SPELLS IN BATTLE USES UP MAGIC POINTS, WHICH, LIKE HIT POINTS, CAN BE RESTORED BY RESTING IN INNS.</desc>

		<desc>THIS IS A PLATFORM "BEAT-'EM-UP" GAME BASED ON THE ANIMÉ SERIES HOKUTO NO KEN. ACCORDING TO THE STORY MENTIONED IN THE MANUAL, KENSHIROU, THE MAIN CHARACTER, HAS TO SAVE THE PEOPLE FROM THE EVIL EMPEROR HEAVEN. THE GAME ITSELF, HOWEVER, FEATURES NO STORY WHATSOEVER, BUT A LOT OF PLATFORM ACTION INSTEAD. YOU HAVE TO RUN QUICKLY THROUGH THE LEVELS (THERE IS A TIME LIMIT), PUNCHING AND KICKING YOUR ENEMIES, CAUSING THEM TO FLY AWAY OR TO EXPLODE, OCCASIONALLY MEETING A BOSS, VISITING SECRET AREAS BEHIND DOORS AND COLLECTING VARIOUS POWER-UPS. 

THIS IS IN FACT THE SECOND GAME IN THE SERIES; THE FIRST ONE WAS NEVER RELEASED OUTSIDE OF JAPAN.</desc>

THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE GAME IS TO GET THROUGH THE 72 ROOMS OF THE FUN HOUSE. THE OBJECT OF EACH ROOM IS TO THROW TOMATOES AT THE TARGETS LITTERED THROUGHOUT THE ROOM BEFORE TIME EXPIRES. SOMETIMES THESE TARGETS ARE NUMBERED, SO THEY HAVE TO BE HIT IN NUMERICAL ORDER. AFTER ALL TARGETS ARE HIT, A KEY WILL APPEAR ALLOWING THE PLAYER TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ROOM. 

THIS MAY APPEAR SIMPLE, BUT THE PLAYER'S CHARACTER IS ON ROLLERBLADES, THUS MAKING NAVIGATING NOT SUCH A SIMPLE TASK.

THE PLAYER ALSO HAS TO DEAL WITH VARIOUS TERRAIN OBSTACLES IN EACH ROOM SUCH AS SLIME COVERED RAMPS OR ICY FLOORS.

THE PLAYER STARTS WITH THREE LIVES, BUT CAN EARN MORE BY COLLECTING 25 SILVER COINS. THERE ARE ALSO GOLD COINS WITH EACH ONE EQUALING 5 SILVER COINS.

OTHER HELPFUL ITEMS THE PLAYER CAN COLLECT ARE GLOP CLOCKS, WITH THE SMALL ONES ADDING 8 SECONDS, AND THE LARGE ONES ADDING 15 SECONDS TO THE GAME CLOCK. THERE ARE ALSO SNEAKERS WHICH WILL TEMPORARILY INCREASE THE PLAYER'S SPEED. THERE ARE ALSO STARBURSTS, WHICH INCREASE THE PLAYERS SCORE AND WARP CUBES, WHICH WILL SEND THE PLAYER TO ANOTHER PART OF THE FUN HOUSE.</desc>

		<desc>GALAXY 5000 IS AN ISOMETRIC-PERSPECTIVE SPACE RACING GAME WHERE 4 SPACESHIPS COMPETE HEAD TO HEAD IN OUTER SPACE RACES. 1 OR 2 HUMAN PLAYERS CAN COMPETE IN THE RACES; THE REST OF THE SHIPS ARE CONTROLLED BY THE COMPUTER. THE SHIPS COMPLETE SEVERAL LAPS AROUND EACH COURSE AND HAVE LIMITED FIRING CAPACITY TO THROW THEIR OPPONENTS OFF BALANCE. THE SHIPS CAN ALSO JUMP. IN FACT, THE SHIPS CAN JUMP RIGHT OFF THE EDGE OF THE COURSE AND DROP DOWN (IN SPACE). IF THE PLAYER DOES NOT COMPLETE A COURSE IN GOOD TIME, THE ENTIRE RACE TRACK WILL DISINTEGRATE AND LEAVE THE SHIP TO FALL DOWN (AND APPARENTLY SPLASH INTO SOME WATER BELOW).

A NOTABLE ITEM ABOUT THIS GAME IS ITS USE OF SQUEAKY, COMICAL, DIGITIZED VOICES FOR EXCLAMATIONS WHEN COLLIDING WITH ANOTHER PLAYER ("HEY!", "EXCUSE ME!", "WATCH IT!"). THERE ARE ALSO 2 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CONTROL SCHEMES THAT A PLAYER CAN ADOPT FOR CRUISING AROUND THE COURSE. THE FIRST SCHEME ROTATES AND DRIVES THE SHIP IN THE DIRECTION THAT THE CONTROL PAD IS BEING PRESSED. THE SECOND SCHEME USES LEFT AND RIGHT TO ROTATE THE SHIP AND UP TO THRUST IN THE DIRECTION THE NOSE IS POINTING.</desc>

		<desc>BATTLETANK IS AN ADVANCED TANK SIMULATOR WHERE PLAYERS TAKE CONTROL OF A TANK FROM ITS DRIVER'S SEAT. PLAYERS ARE STUCK STRAIGHT IN THE TANK AND SENT OFF TO THE BATTLEFIELD IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THE MISSION THEY ARE ASSIGNED TO.  

MISSION OBJECTIVES.CAN BE ANYTHING FROM ELIMINATING THE ENEMIES TO DESTROYING THE ENEMY FUEL DUMP TO TAKING OUT AN ENEMY CAMP.  HOWEVER DANGEROUS ENEMIES LURK ALL OVER THE BATTLEFIELD.  HELICOPTERS, MINEFIELDS AND OTHER TANKS WAIT TO BLOCK YOUR MOVES.  THESE ENEMIES CAN MOVE OFF-SCREEN AND STRAFE AROUND THE TANK, LEADING TO DIFFICULTIES.  

HOWEVER, MANY STRATEGIC ELEMENTS ARE INVOLVED.  THE FIRST-PERSON MODE OFFERS A LIMITED VIEW OF THE BATTLEFIELD, AND IF PLAYERS PUSH THE TANK INTO OVERDRIVE IT CAN MISS THE TARGET AND RUSH INTO A NEST OF TANKS OR A MINEFIELD.  TURRET ANGLE, AMMUNITION, AND TANK FUEL REMAINING MUST ALL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BY THE PLAYER.  TO ADD TO THIS, CERTAIN GUNS ON THE TANK (THERE'S 4 OF THEM) WILL ONLY HURT CERTAIN ENEMIES.  BUT DON'T EXPECT ANY HELP HERE!  SIX HITS AND YOUR TANK IS COOKED!</desc>

IT FEATURED A CHOICE OF FOUR CHARACTERS TO PLAY WITH, EACH WITH DIFFERENT WEAPONS. THOR THE WARRIOR, HAS A  BLUDGEONING BATTLE AXE, THYRA THE VALKYRIE, HAS A CLOSE RANGE SWORD, QUESTOR THE ELF HAS HIS LONG RANGE BOW, AND MERLIN THE WIZARD HAS MAGICAL BOLTS.

GHOSTS, GOBLINS AND EVEN THE LIFE DRAINING DEATH ARE YOUR ENEMIES. ENEMIES STREAM OUT OF GENERATORS, SO DESTROY THESE BEFORE TACKLING THE REST. 

KEYS ARE NEEDED TO OPEN THE MANY DOORS WITHIN THE LEVELS, AND IN SOME SITUATIONS A DOOR WILL CONTAIN ONLY BONUS ITEMS, NOT A PROGRESSIVE ROUTE.  SCATTERED MAGIC POTIONS ACT LIKE SMART BOMBS AND CLEAR THE SCREEN OF ALL ENEMIES. BEWARE OF POISON THOUGH, THIS REDUCES YOUR ENERGY LEVEL.
TREASURE IS ABUNDANT THROUGHOUT THE LEVELS AND ADDS TO YOUR SCORE.</desc>

		<name>George Foreman's KO Boxing</name>
		<desc>FEATURING HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION GEORGE FOREMAN, THIS IS A BOXING SIMULATION WHERE PLAYERS, TAKING THE ROLE OF FOREMAN, GO THROUGH A SERIES OF TWELVE ROUNDS AGAINST DIFFERENT BOXERS TO WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP TITLE BELT.

PLAYED FROM AN THIRD-PERSON PERSPECTIVE USING A VIEW FROM RIGHT OVER THE SHOULDERS OVER THE BOXER, PLAYERS CAN MOVE LEFT AND RIGHT TO DODGE INCOMING PUNCHES, BLOCK AND THROW LEFT AND RIGHT PUNCHES. THE STANDARD PUNCH IS A CROSS, BUT BY HOLDING THE UP-KEY PRESSED, JABS CAN ALSO BE THROWN.

BY AVOIDING PUNCHES AND HITTING THEM, A SUPERPUNCH OFTEN BECOMES AVAILABLE, INFLICTING MUCH MORE DAMAGE. A FIGHT CONSISTS OF A MAXIMUM OF THREE ROUNDS OF THREE MINUTES EACH. WHEN A BOXER IS KNOCKED DOWN FOUR TIMES, THE MATCH IS OVER (TECHNICAL KNOCK-OUT). THE SAME HAPPENS WHEN A BOXER GOES DOWN THREE TIMES IN A SINGLE ROUND (REGULAR KNOCK-OUT). WHEN DOWN, PLAYERS NEED TO PRESS BOTH PUNCH BUTTONS IN RAPID SUCCESSION TO GET BACK TO THEIR FEET. THE SCREEN SHOWS AN ENERGY METER DRAINED WHEN PUNCHES ARE RECEIVED. AFTER BEING KNOCKED DOWN AND DURING INTERMISSIONS, SOME ENERGY IS RESTORED.

ALL VERSIONS, EXCEPT FOR THE GAME BOY, CAN BE PLAYED WITH TWO PLAYERS. A PASSWORD SYSTEM IS USED TO SAVE THE PROGRESS.</desc>

		<desc>BASED ON THE MOVIE OF THE SAME NAME, THE GHOSTBUSTERS ARE THE ONES TO CALL WHO WILL "BUST" ANY GHOST HAUNTINGS. IT DOES THIS THROUGH THE USE OF NUCLEAR ACCELERATED "PROTON PACKS" AND TRAPS, WHEREBY THE GHOSTS CAN BE CAPTURED AND TRANSFERRED TO A SECURE STORAGE FACILITY. HOWEVER NEW YORK CITY HAS SUDDENLY BECOME A VERY HAUNTED PLACE, AND THE NUMBER OF GHOSTS HAS SUDDENLY INCREASED. THE GHOSTBUSTERS MUST REDUCE THE PARANORMAL (PK) LEVEL IN THE CITY, REPRESENTING GHOST POWER, BEFORE THE TEMPLE OF ZUUL AWAKENS AND RESSURECTS AN EVIL GODDESS, GOZER.

GHOSTBUSTERS IS AN ACTION GAME THAT COMBINES AN OVERHEAD VIEW AND A SIDE-VIEW. FROM GHOSTBUSTERS HQ, THE PLAYER MUST MONITOR THE MAP OF NEW YORK CITY FOR "GHOST ALARMS" AS WELL AS CASUAL SPIRITS, AND PLOT A ROUTE TO THE ALARMED AREA. THE PLAYER THEN CONTROLS THE GHOSTBUSTER VEHICLE AS IT DRIVES THROUGH TRAFFIC. HERE, THE PLAYER IS ABLE TO CAPTURE CASUAL GHOSTS ON THE WAY IF THEY ARE EN ROUTE. ONCE AT THE LOCATION, THE GAME SWITCHES TO A SIDE-VIEW. TWO OF THE GHOSTBUSTERS WILL TAKE POSITION AND ACTIVATE THEIR PROTON BEAMS AND TOSS A TRAP TO THE GROUND. THE PLAYER WILL ATTEMPT TO  MANEUVER THE GHOST(S) OVER THE PLACED TRAP. ONCE ACTIVATED, THE TRAP ATTEMPTS TO CAPTURE ANY GHOSTS DIRECTLY ABOVE IT. SUCCESSFUL CAPTURE WILL EARN THE PLAYER MONEY, WHICH CAN THEN BE USED TO PURCHASE NEW GHOSTBUSTERS VEHICLES AND NEW MODIFICATIONS FOR THE VEHICLE. UNSUCCESSFUL CAPTURE WILL SEE THE GHOST FLY AWAY.

AS THE GAME PROGRESSES, THE PK ENERGY OF THE CITY INCREASES. GHOSTBUSTERS MUST KEEP IT UNDER CRITICAL LEVELS BY BEING CONSTANTLY  SUCCESSFUL AT GHOST CAPTURES. EVENTUALLY THE TEMPLE OF ZUUL WILL ACTIVATE, AND IF THE PK LEVELS ARE STILL MANAGEABLE, THE GHOSTBUSTERS CAN VENTURE THERE FOR A FINAL SHOWDOWN WITH GOZER.</desc>

WHILE TAKING A SHORTCUT THROUGH THE GRAVEYARD HOME ONE DAY, HE COMES ACROSS A GLOWING SKULL. INTRIGUED, HE TAKES IT TO DR. FEMUR, HIS ANATOMY TEACHER, THE NEXT DAY, WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THE DAY BEFORE HALLOWEEN. DR. FEMUR WANTS TO KEEP IT FOR AN OVERNIGHT STUDY, AND SPIKE RELUCTANTLY AGREES, NOTICING THAT THE SKULL APPEARED BIGGER THAN THE DAY BEFORE.

DURING THE NIGHT, THE SKULL BEGINS TRANSMITTING A MESSAGE TO THE REALM OF THE DEAD. ON HALLOWEEN, THE DEAD BEGIN THEIR ASSAULT. THE TEACHERS AND STUDENTS INSIDE ARE TURNED INTO ZOMBIES AND DEMONS UNDER THE CONTROL OF WHATEVER INTELLIGENCE HAS TAKEN OVER THE SCHOOL. SAMANTHA POM-POM, THE HEAD CHEERLEADER, IS CAPTURED BY THE DEAD AND HELD SOMEWHERE INSIDE THE SCHOOL. PARANORMAL ELIMINATORS AND MEMBERS OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM HAVE VENTURED INSIDE TO FIND HER, BUT HAVE NOT RETURNED. WHEN SPIKE LEARNS OF THE MESS FROM THE TV NEWS, HE RUSHES TO THE SCHOOL AND DECIDES TO RESCUE HER HIMSELF.

SPIKE VENTURES INSIDE. THE DOORS SHUT AND LOCK BEHIND HIM. THERE'S NO TURNING BACK NOW.

SPIKE BEGINS HIS QUEST WITH ONLY HIS TRUSTY BASEBALL BAT AND BATTERED SNEAKERS, BUT CAN COLLECT BETTER WEAPONS AND SHOES ALONG THE WAY. AMONG THEM ARE THE STRAIGHTFORWARD SICKLE, EMBALMING FLUID, TOWEL AND ALMIGHTY GAMMA GUN, THE STRANGE DEWEYTRON AND TASERLIKE SPINAL ZAP, AND A SANDWICH (IF IT CAN BE USED AS A WEAPON, THEY SHOULD HAVE FIRED THE CAFETERIA WORKERS A LONG TIME AGO), AMONG OTHER WEAPONS. USEFUL ITEMS INCLUDE THE SPRING SHOES, NEEDED TO REACH HIGH PLACES, THE SUCTION SHOES, WHICH ALLOW YOU TO WALK ON THE CEILING, AND THE GOLDEN APPLE, NEEDED TO BYPASS THE MEDUSA HEAD GUARDING THE WAY TO THE SECOND HALF OF THE SCHOOL.

GET GOING! YOU HAVE 129 ROOMS TO EXPLORE AND SAMANTHA IS COUNTING ON YOU. GOOD LUCK.</desc>

		<desc>THIS GAME WAS MADE WITH THE INTENTIONS OF HELPING THE PLAYER IMPROVE THEIR GOLF GAME. YOU CAN PRACTICE SETTING UP PUTTS, DEALING WITH WIND RESISTANCE, CHOOSING A STRIKE POINT ON THE GOLF BALL, AND OTHER TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF GOLFING IN THE TWO TRAINING MODES THE GAME OFFERS. ONCE YOU FEEL YOU HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE YOU CAN ENTER THE GOLF GRAND SLAM, A TOURNAMENT AGAINST 29 OTHER FICTITIOUS PRO PLAYERS.

THE GAME FEATURES 4 SETS OF 14 DIFFERENT GOLF CLUBS THAT YOU CAN BRING TO THE COURSE. THE GOLFING IS DONE BY LINING UP A CURSOR TO WHERE YOU WANT THE BALL TO LAND AND THEN CHOOSING THE PROPER GOLF CLUB, STANCE, AND GRIP. THE LAST STEP BEFORE TAKING THE SWING IS FINDING THE CORRECT CONTACT POINT ON THE GOLF BALL. THE CONTACT POINT IS REPRESENTED AS A DOT THAT SCATTERS AROUND ON TOP OF A GOLF BALL ICON AND YOU HAVE TO TRY TO STOP IT ON THE PART OF THE BALL WHERE YOU WANT YOUR CLUB TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE BALL.</desc>

INDY IS ARMED WITH HIS TRUSTY WHIP TO FIGHT OFF FOES, BUT CAN ALSO GET INVOLVED IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT. THE FIRST LEVEL TAKES PLACE IN CAVES UNDERNEATH COLORADO, BEFORE YOU REACH A MOVING CIRCUS TRAIN STREWN WITH TRAPS, A ZEPPELIN WHICH IS FULL OF GUARDS AND LADDERS, AND THEN CASTLE GRUNWALD IN AUSTRIA.</desc>

		<desc>INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE DIFFERS FROM THE TWO OTHER GAMES WITH THE SAME NAME AS IT IS A HYBRID OF VARIOUS GENRES SUCH AS PLATFORM ACTION, MOTORCYCLE RACING, PUZZLE SOLVING AND EVEN SOME ADVENTURE ELEMENTS.

IN INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE YOU PLAY INDY'S ROLE IN HIS SEARCH FOR THE HOLY GRAIL, BUT THIS TIME IT IS YOU WHO CHOOSES WHICH STEP HE WILL TAKE AT EACH PART OF HIS QUEST. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE VERY BEGINNING YOU RECEIVE A DIARY ABOUT THE GRAIL FROM INDY'S FATHER, WHO IS IN VENICE. AT THE SAME TIME, YOU RECEIVE A TELEGRAM FROM MARCUS SAYING THAT THE CROSS OF CORONADO IS IN PORTUGAL ON A SHIP CALLED CORONADO, AND THAT HE'LL MEET INDY THERE. SO YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE WHAT YOU'LL DO FIRST: GO TO VENICE AND CHECK ABOUT THE GRAIL AND YOUR FATHER, OR GO TO PORTUGAL TO FIND MARCUS AND THE CROSS OF CORONADO.

IN THE ENTIRE GAME YOU'LL BE PROMPTED WITH THESE CHOICES, EACH ONE LEADING TO DIFFERENT STAGES THROUGHOUT THE GAME. EACH STAGE PRESENTS DIFFERENT GAME GENRES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN VENICE YOU FIND A SCRAMBLED PICTURE OF THE GRAIL, AND YOU HAVE TO TRY TO PUT IT BACK TOGETHER, JUST LIKE YOU'D DO WITH THE PIECES OF A PUZZLE. BESIDES, IN THE PLATFORM STAGES, INDY HAS PLENTY OF MOVEMENTS, AS HE CAN PUNCH, KICK, WALK, RUN, JUMP AND USE HIS WHIP.

THE GAME PRESENTS BITMAPPED PICTURES OF THE REAL MOVIE ACTORS, SUCH AS HARRISON FORD AND SEAN CONNERY.</desc>

ESCAPE WITH THE MINE CART AFTER YOU'VE FREED ALL CHILDREN.
2. MINE CART LEVEL: PICK THE RIGHT ROUTE THROUGH A NETWORK OF TRACKS WHILE RIDING IN A MINE CART. AVOID POTHOLES, BROKEN TRACKS &amp; GUARDS IN CARTS AND SAFELY REACH THE END OF THE TRACK.
3. TEMPLE LEVEL: MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE ALTAR AND GRAB THE SANKARA STONE WHILE MOLA RAM, BATS AND THUGGEE GUARDS ATTACK YOU. WATCH OUT FOR THAT LAVA.

ALONG THE WAY, THE SHIP WILL STOP TO ALLOW A DIVER TO SWIM OUT AND KILL BABY SHARKS, JELLYFISH AND MANTA RAYS TO FIND CONCH SHELLS.  THE CONCH SHELLS ARE USED TO BUY UPGRADES FOR THE BOAT.  EXTRA CONCH SHELLS CAN BE EARNED IN BONUS ROUNDS WHERE A SEA PLANE FLIES OVER THE WATER TO BOMB JELLYFISH (THINK THE BONUS ROUNDS OF GALAGA WITH REVERSED PERSPECTIVE).

THE DIVER WILL BATTLE JAWS SEVERAL TIMES IN AN ATTEMPT TO WEAR DOWN HIS LIFE METER.  IF THE PLAYER IS LUCKY, THEY CAN FIND A SUBMARINE TO INCREASE THEIR FIREPOWER AND DEFENSE.

IF THE DIVER MANAGES TO WEAR DOWN JAWS' ENERGY, THEY TAKE BACK TO THE BOAT AGAIN, LAUNCHING STROBES INTO THE WATER IN AN ATTEMPT TO LURE THE SHARK OUT OF THE WATER.  IF CLOSE ENOUGH, THE PLAYER CAN USE THE BOAT TO RAM JAWS IN AN ATTEMPT TO KILL HIM AND WIN THE GAME.</desc>

UP TO THREE PLAYERS CAN TAKE PART IN THE THREE-ROUND TRIVIA CONTEST WHERE THE ANSWERS ARE GIVEN AND THE CONTESTANTS MUST SUPPLY THE CORRECT QUESTION.

IN THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS, SIX CATEGORIES OF FIVE ANSWERS EACH ARE RANDOMLY CHOSEN BY THE COMPUTER TO FILL THE "WALL" AND THE PLAYER BEGINS BY CHOOSING ANY ONE OF THEM.  AFTER THE CHOSEN ANSWER IS GIVEN, THE FIRST PLAYER TO HIT HIS "BUZZER" GIVES THE RESPONSE USING THE CONTROLLER TO MOVE A CURSOR OVER AN ONSCREEN KEYBOARD, SPELLING OUT THE QUESTION WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT.  IN THE FINAL ROUND, A CATEGORY IS ANNOUNCED AND THE PLAYERS EACH PLACE A BET, UP TO THE LIMIT OF THEIR WINNINGS SO FAR, ON THE FINAL QUESTION.  AFTER ALL PLAYERS ARE READY, THE FINAL ANSWER IS SHOWN AND ALL PLAYERS GIVE THEIR QUESTIONS.

		<desc>GAMETEK'S FAITHFUL NES RECREATION OF THE LONG-RUNNING INTERNATIONAL QUIZ SHOW. UP TO THREE CONTESTANTS CAN PLAY AT ONCE, WITH GAPS OPTIONALLY FILLED IN BY COMPUTER AI. IF THREE HUMAN PLAYERS ARE ENGAGED, THEN PLAYER 1 AND 2 SHARE THE FIRST CONTROLLER, WITH THE SECOND CONTROLLER GOING TO PLAYER 3.

FOR THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS, SIX CATEGORIES WITH FIVE QUESTIONS EACH ARE RANDOMLY SELECTED BY THE COMPUTER TO POPULATE THE GAME BOARD. THE CONTESTANT WHO ANSWERED THE LAST QUESTION CORRECTLY GETS TO PICK THE CATEGORY AND A DOLLAR VALUE, WITH HARDER QUESTIONS BEING WORTH MORE MONEY. PLAYERS HAVE TEN SECONDS FROM THE TIME A QUESTION APPEARS TO "RING IN" WITH THE APPROPRIATE CONTROLLER BUTTON AND ANSWER. 

ANSWERS ARE BUILT BY USING THE CONTROLLER TO NAVIGATE AROUND A GRID OF LETTERS AND "TYPE" OUT THE CORRECT ANSWER. SPACES AND PUNCTUATION ARE IGNORED, BUT SPELLING AND GRAMMAR GENERALLY MUST MATCH THE EXPECTED ANSWER EXACTLY. THE CONTESTANT HAS 30 SECONDS TO PROVIDE THE ANSWER BEFORE "TIME IS UP" AND THE OTHER PLAYERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RING IN.

FINAL JEOPARDY CONSISTS OF ONE CATEGORY, WHICH PLAYERS BET THEIR CURRENT WINNINGS ON BEING ABLE TO ANSWER. A SINGLE QUESTION FROM THAT CATEGORY IS ASKED AFTER THE HIDDEN BETS HAVE BEEN PLACED. AGAIN, EACH PLAYER HAS 30 SECONDS TO PROVIDE THEIR ANSWER WHILE THE OTHER PLAYERS ARE INSTRUCTED TO LOOK AWAY. AT THE END, SCORES ARE TALLIED AND THE WINNER DECLARED.

CATEGORIES IN THIS EDITION DRAW FROM GENERAL KNOWLEDGE AND DO NOT FOLLOW A SPECIFIC THEME (LIKE THE SPORTS OR STAR WARS EDITIONS). EACH CATEGORY WILL ALWAYS CONSIST OF THE SAME FIVE QUESTIONS, AND THE GAME DRAWS ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF CATEGORIES. REPEATS WILL APPEAR AFTER A HANDFUL OF SESSIONS PLAYED. SOME QUESTIONS "CURRENT" FOR 1987 WILL ALSO BE LESS OBVIOUS DECADES LATER, AND MORE DIFFICULT THAN INTENDED.</desc>

		<desc>ONE OF MANY DIFFERENT TITLES BASED ON STEVEN SPIELBERG'S 1993 DINOSAUR THRILLER, THE VERSION FOR NES AND GAME BOY IS A TOP-DOWN ACTION GAME WITH EXPLORATION ELEMENTS.

PLAYING AS DR. ALAN GRANT, THE PLAYER MUST WORK THROUGH SIX LEVELS BY COMPLETING CERTAIN OBJECTIVES INCLUDING RESCUING THE KIDS TIM AND LEX, RESTORING POWER, DESTROYING RAPTOR NESTS AND FINALLY GETTING OFF THE DINOSAUR-INFESTED ISLAND. TO ADVANCE IN A LEVEL, A NUMBER OF DINOSAUR EGGS SCATTERED OVER THE AREA MUST BE COLLECTED OR DESTROYED. THIS WILL REVEAL A PASSCARD USED TO GAIN ENTRY TO BUILDINGS, OR SOME OTHER ITEMS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE ASSIGNMENT. THE PARK'S COMPUTER TERMINALS CAN BE USED TO REQUEST HINTS ON WHERE TO GO NEXT.

NATURALLY, THE LEVELS ARE FULL OF HOSTILE DINOSAURS. DR. GRANT CAN FEND THEM OFF WITH HIS GUN. SEVERAL AMMUNITION TYPES ARE AVAILABLE, VARYING IN DAMAGE AND SHOOTING PATTERNS. KILLED DINOSAURS WILL ALWAYS DROP THE MOST BASIC AMMO TYPE, THE OTHERS MUST BE FOUND. NEXT TO AMMO CLIPS, THERE ARE BOXES WITH QUESTION MARKS ON THEM TO BE COLLECTED. THESE MIGHT INCLUDE BENEFICIAL POWERUPS LIKE A HEALTH INCREASE, BUT CAN ALSO BE DANGEROUS AND REVEAL A BOMB.

SOME LEVELS END IN BOSS ENCOUNTERS, INCLUDING A TRICERATOPS STAMPEDE AND A FIGHT AGAINST THE TYRANNOSAURUS REX.</desc>

UNLIKE MOST PLATFORMERS, MOMENTUM IS VERY IMPORTANT IN KID KOOL.  HE TAKES SEVERAL STEPS TO GET UP TO FULL SPEED WHEN RUNNING AND CANNOT STOP ON A DIME.  THERE IS NO AIR CONTROL, SO HOW FAR HE IS ABLE TO JUMP DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON HOW FAST HE WAS GOING WHEN HE LEFT THE GROUND.

KOOL FACES A VARIETY OF ENEMIES.  THEY CAN BE DEFEATED BY JUMPING ON THEIR HEADS.  THE FIRST JUMP DRIVES THEM INTO THE GROUND AND THE SECOND ELIMINATES THEM.  THEY ALSO CAN BE BEATEN WITH A FURRY COMPANION THAT KOOL CAN PICK UP BY RUNNING FAST ENOUGH PAST THE APPROPRIATE SPOTS.  HE CAN BE THROWN WITH THE B BUTTON, THEN RETRIEVED BY STANDING NEAR HIM.  HE ALSO AFFORDS SOME PROTECTION AS IF KOOL IS HIT WHILE HOLDING HIM, HE WILL ONLY LOSE HIS COMPANION, NOT A LIFE.</desc>

THE FIRST FOUR STAGES INVOLVE YOU POWERING UP YOUR CHARACTERS AS FAR AS THEY CAN GO, PICKING UP SHIELDS (TO INCREASE DEFENSE), BOOTS (TO INCREASE SPEED), SWORDS (TO INCREASE ATTACK POWER), AND SPELL ICONS (WHICH WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE HELD BY EVERYONE FOR THE FINAL STORM ON THE CASTLE), DEFEATING MONSTERS ALONG THE WAY. THE POWER-UPS ARE HIDDEN UNDERNEATH MOUNTAINS, ROCKS, AND HOUSES. NEARLY EVERYTHING CAN BE SHOT AT AND DESTROYED. THE HEROES ARE, IN ORDER:

RAY JACK, THE KNIGHT, WHO POSSESSES STRONG ATTACKING POWER;
KALIVA, THE WIZARD, WHO IS GOOD WITH MAGIC AND JUMPING;
BARUSA, THE MONSTER, WHO HAS A STRONG DEFENSE; AND
TOBY, THE THIEF, WHO CAN MOVE SWIFTLY.

IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP ALL FOUR HEROES ALIVE FOR THE FIFTH AND FINAL STAGE, BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN POINTS THAT THE GROUP CANNOT GET PAST IF ONE OF THE PARTY MEMBERS HAS DIED.</desc>

JACKY AND LEE MUST FIGHT THEIR WAY INTO EIGHT DIFFERENT CASTLES IN ORDER TO DEFEAT THE MONSTERS AND RESCUE THE PRINCESS.

CHINESE HERO IS A TOP-DOWN ACTION GAME FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS, BOTH PLAYING ON THE SAME SCREEN. EACH NINJA HAS THE ABILITY TO MOVE IN ANY OF FOUR DIRECTIONS: UP, DOWN, LEFT AND RIGHT, AS WELL AS PUNCH DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEM AND DO A "MOON SAULT KICK" (WHICH CAN BE POWERED UP TO A "MIRACLE KICK") WHEREBY THEY JUMP AND SOMERSAULT DIRECTLY IN FRONT. BOTH PUNCHES AND THE MOON SAULT KICK CAN HARM ENEMIES. DEFEATING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF ENEMIES ON EACH LEVEL WILL OPEN THE DOORWAY INTO THE NEXT LEVEL. OCCASIONALLY EXTRA PASSAGES (NAMED "QUICK PASSAGE ZONE") CAN BE FOUND TO TAKE SHORTCUTS THROUGH AREAS WITH STRONGER ENEMIES. AT TIMES, DEFEATED ENEMIES WILL LEAVE POWER-UPS BEHIND WHICH EITHER PLAYER CAN COLLECT IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR ABILITIES TEMPORARILY. WHILE POWER-UPS ARE DIVERSE, HERE ARE EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE EFFECTS: WEAKENING SPECIFIC ENEMIES, INVINCIBILITY, INCREASED ATTACK, EXTRA LIVES AND THE ABILITY TO USE PROJECTILE ATTACKS.</desc>

		<name>Legacy of the Wizard</name>
		<desc>LONG AGO, AN EVIL DRAGON NAMED KEELA WAS IMPRISONED INSIDE A MAGICAL DUNGEON. HOWEVER TIME HAS PASSED AND THE MAGIC THAT SEALED THE DRAGON AWAY IS WEAKENING. THE DRASLE FAMILY DECIDES THAT IT'S TIME TO DESTROY THE DRAGON ONCE AND FOR ALL. HOWEVER ONLY ONE WEAPON IS CAPABLE OF DOING THIS, THE DRAGON SLAYER, WHICH IS ITSELF SEALED AWAY BY FOUR MAGICAL CROWNS. THE DRASLE FAMILY DECIDES TO TAKE ON THIS QUEST, AND WILL USE EVERY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH IT.

LEGACY OF THE WIZARD IS AN SIDE-SCROLLING ACTION PLATFORM GAME WITH ROLE-PLAYING ELEMENTS.  THE PLAYER CHOOSES A CHARACTER FROM AMONG FIVE DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE DRASLE FAMILY. THE CHOICES ARE: XEMM THE FATHER AND WOODCUTTER, MAYNA THE MAGIC-USING MOTHER, ROAS THE BRAVE WARRIOR SON, LYLL THE ATHLETIC DAUGHTER AND POCHI THE DOMESTICATED MONSTER-PET. EACH CHARACTER HAS UNIQUE ABILITIES (INCLUDING ATTACK AND JUMPING ABILITIES) AND CAN ONLY USE CERTAIN ITEMS FROM THOSE COLLECTED. PLAYERS CAN TRAVEL BACK TO THE DRASLE HOUSEHOLD AT ANY POINT TO CHANGE CHARACTERS.

THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO ENTER THE LARGE DUNGEON, ITSELF DIVIDED INTO 5 AREAS, COLLECTING A VARIETY OF ITEMS (WHICH AS MENTIONED, CAN ONLY BE USED BY PARTICULAR CHARACTERS) AND USE THEM TO PROGRESS THROUGH THE DUNGEON, DEFEATING MONSTERS. POWER-UPS DROPPED BY MONSTERS INCLUDE GOLD, KEYS, HEALTH-RESTORING BREAD, MAGIC-RESORING POTIONS AND HEALTH-DAMAGING POISON. GOLD CAN BE SPENT ON ITEMS AND OTHER POWER-UPS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AT VARIOUS SHOPS HIDDEN INSIDE THE DUNGEON. THE PLAYER MUST EVENTUALLY DEFEAT THE FOUR BOSSES GUARDING THE CROWNS THAT SEAL THE DRAGON SLAYER AND THEN USE THAT WEAPON TO DEFEAT THE KRESS.</desc>

THE WHITE LION RAN AWAY AND FOUND A SHELTER IN A DARK CAVE NEAR THE TOWN. SOME YEARS LATER, MARIA'S PARENTS ORGANIZE AN EXPEDITION TO THE CAVE IN ORDER TO FIND OUT WHAT THE WHITE LION REALLY IS. BUT THEY NEVER COME BACK...

NOW MARIA HAS TO GO TO THE CAVE AND TO SEARCH FOR HER PARENTS. EQUIPPED WITH THE FAMOUS SPEAR THE BRAVE SOLDIER MOJA USED TO DEFEAT THE LION, SHE RECEIVES THE VILLAGE ELDER'S PERMISSION TO DESCEND INTO THE CAVE. BUT WHILE WANDERING THROUGH THE DARK CORRIDORS, SHE FALLS INTO A RIVER, AND A STRONG CURRENT BRINGS HER TO THE DREAM WORLD. SHE NO LONGER CAN RETURN BACK, AND THE FAIRIES WHO INHABIT THE DREAM WORLD TELL HER THAT THE ONLY WAY TO DEFEAT THE LION IS TO TRAVEL TO YET ANOTHER WORLD - THE DARK WORLD...

IN THIS GAME, YOU CONTROL MARIA AS SHE TRAVELS ON THE WORLD MAPS, VISITS TOWNS, AND DESCENDS INTO DUNGEONS. THE BATTLES ARE TURN-BASED AND ARE VIEWED FROM FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE IN DRAGON WARRIOR STYLE. INSTEAD OF PARTY MEMBERS YOU HAVE GHOSTS YOU CAN SUMMON TO HELP YOU IN BATTLES, SUCH AS THE SOLDIER MOJA AND OTHERS. HIT POINTS AND MAGIC POINTS ARE CALLED COURAGE AND DREAM, RESPECTIVELY.

THE PRIMARY GAMEPLAY MODE IS A TOP-DOWN, VERTICAL-SCROLLING SHOOTER SIMILAR TO XEVIOUS AND CAPCOM'S OWN 1943.  YOUR MAIN WEAPON IS USED TO ATTACK FLYING ENEMIES, AND YOUR SECONDARY MISSILE WEAPON IS USED TO ATTACK FIXED PLACEMENT, LAND-BASED ENEMIES.  NUMEROUS POWERUPS ARE AVAILABLE ALONG THE WAY, AND THESE BOTH IMPROVE YOUR WEAPONS AND YOUR RESISTANCE TO DAMAGE (EVERY "UPGRADE" IS WORTH A FREE HIT FROM ENEMIES WITHOUT DYING).

SEVERAL SECONDARY GAMEPLAY MODES (DANGER, LUCKY, AND PALACE) ARE ALSO TRIGGERED AT KEY POINTS IN THE VERTICAL-SCROLLING MODE.  ALL OF THE SECONDARY MODES ARE SIDE-SCROLLING SHOOTERS.  THE DANGER STAGE REQUIRES YOU TO FACE A GAUNTLET OF ENEMIES, WHILE THE LUCKY STAGE IS FULL OF POWERUPS, GAME CONTINUES, AND OTHER BONUSES.  THE PALACE STAGE IS TRIGGERED WHEN YOU DEFEAT A MINI-BOSS; YOU MUST GET PAST THE PALACE DEFENSES BEFORE YOU CAN FACE THE END-OF-STAGE BOSS.  AND, OH YEAH...DON'T GET CRUSHED BY THOSE WALLS!</desc>

		<desc>TA-KEED, THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS, HAS MANAGED TO ESCAPE FROM HIS SUPERNATURAL PENITENTIARY WHERE HE HAS HAD CENTURIES TO PLOT EXACTLY HOW HE WILL TAKE REVENGE ON THOSE THAT LOCKED HIM AWAY. EMPEROR HANS SENDS HIS TROOPS TO DEAL WITH THIS THREAT, BUT THEY ARE NO MATCH FOR THE ULTIMATE EVIL ONE. AS AN ALTERNATIVE, THE EMPEROR SUMMONS THE BEARERS OF 4 MAGICAL BELLS. THESE 4 ADVENTURERS MUST MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE CASTLE AND WORK AS A TEAM IF THEY ARE TO DESTROY TA-KEED.

THE FIRST PART OF LITTLE SAMSON HAS EACH OF THE 4 CHARACTERS JOURNEYING FROM HIS OR HER HOME LAND TO THE EMPEROR'S PALACE. THIS GIVES THE PLAYER AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE THAT CHARACTER'S UNIQUE ABILITIES WHICH WILL BE ESSENTIAL THROUGHOUT THE GAME.

1. SAMSON IS A HUMAN WHO IS REASONABLY FAST AND ALSO POSSESSES MAGNIFICENT ROCK CLIMBING PROWESS. HE IS ABLE TO SCALE WALLS AND HANG ACROSS CEILINGS, AND ALSO GRAB ONTO WALLS AND CEILINGS WHILE JUMPING. HIS OFFENSIVE OPTION IS THE ABILITY TO SHOOT BELLS STRAIGHT AHEAD.

2. KIKIRA IS THE DRAGON LORD. SINCE SHE HAS CLAWS, SHE DOES NOT SLIP ON ICE. WHEN SHE JUMPS, SHE CAN ALSO FLY FOR SHORT BURSTS. SHE BREATHES FIRE IN 2 INTENSITIES, DEPENDING ON HOW LONG THE PLAYER HOLDS DOWN THE FIRE BUTTON. HER FIREBALLS SPREAD IN ARC PATTERNS.

3. GAMM IS THE ROCK LORD. SINCE HE IS A LIVING ROCK HE IS VERY STRONG. SO STRONG IN FACT THAT SPIKES DO NOT HURT HIM, WHICH IS VERY VALUABLE IN A NUMBER OF SITUATIONS. HE IS ALSO VERY SLOW AND HAS ONLY A SHORT LEAP. HE HAS A POWERFUL PUNCH.

4. K.O. IS THE MOUSE LORD. HE IS TINY WHICH ALLOWS HIM TO ENTER AREAS THAT OTHER TEAM MEMBERS CAN NOT. HE IS ALSO EXTREMELY FAST AND THE HIGHEST JUMPER OF THE TEAM. HOWEVER, HE IS THE WEAKEST MEMBER SO HE CAN NOT SUSTAIN VERY MUCH DAMAGE. HE HAS THE SAME WALL AND CEILING TRAVERSAL ABILITIES AS SAMSON. OFFENSIVELY, HE CAN DROP TIME-DELAY BOMBS.

WHEN ALL 4 CHARACTERS REACH THE EMPEROR'S PALACE, THEY ALL JUMP INTO SAMSON'S BELL. ACTUALLY, GAMM AND K.O. QUIETLY JUMP INTO SAMSON'S BELL; KIKIRA INITIALLY REFUSES. AFTER A BRIEF FIGHT (WITH THE PLAYER CONTROLLING SAMSON), KIKIRA JOINS THE EFFORT. THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE GAME, THE PLAYER CAN SWITCH BETWEEN ANY OF THE 4 CHARACTERS BY ENTERING THE SUB-SCREEN. EACH CHARACTER HAS THEIR OWN POWER METER. HOWEVER, ALL THE CHARACTERS SHARE LIVES. IF THE PRESENTLY SELECTED CHARACTER LOSES ALL OF HIS OR HER POWER, THEN ONE LIFE IS LOST. THE PLAYER MUST SWAP BETWEEN ALL 4 CHARACTERS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE JOURNEY.</desc>

THE EMPIRE HAS SENT ROBOTIC GUARDS DOWN TO PROTECT THE GOLD, AND CONTACT WITH ANY OF THESE WILL COST YOU A LIFE. YOUR METHOD OF ESCAPING THEM IS TO PRESS FIRE TO DIG A HOLE IN THEIR LINE OF MOVEMENT, THUS CAUSING THEM TO FALL IN BRIEFLY, ALLOWING YOU TO MOVE ACROSS THE GAP SAFELY. ONCE ALL THE GOLD HAS BEEN COLLECTED, A LADDER ALLOWING YOU TO MOVE ONTO THE NEXT SCREEN IS ADDED. COMPLETING THESE SCREENS OFTEN REQUIRES FORWARD PLANNING AND PRECISION.

THIS WAS ONE OF THE EARLIEST GAMES TO INCLUDE A LEVEL EDITOR, ALLOWING THE CREATION OF NEW LEVEL DESIGNS WITH NO PROGRAMMING SKILL.</desc>

IT IS UP TO THE PLAYER TO LINK THEM UP IN A LOOP FORM, THEN MOVING ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL. PIECES CAN BE PLACED ON ANY EMPTY SPACE ON THE GRID, AND ROTATED INTO ONE OF THE FOUR MAIN COMPASS DIRECTIONS.

ANY PIECES WHICH ARE NOT PART OF THE FINISHED LOOP WHEN A LEVEL IS COMPLETED ARE LEFT ON THE SCREEN, SO THERE IS VALUE IN PLAYING TOWARDS 2 DISTINCT LOOPS, TO ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE OPTIONS DEPENDING ON WHICH PIECES ARE DRAWN - UNLIKE PIPE DREAM THERE ARE NO CLUES AS TO WHICH PIECES ARE COMING NEXT.

THREE PLAY MODES ARE AVAILABLE, TWO OF WHICH CAN BE PLAYED WITH TWO PLAYERS. GAME A IS FREESTYLE - SIMPLY MAKE LOOPS, GAINING EXTRA POINTS FOR SIZE AND STYLE. 

GAME B IS ABOUT UNLOCKING BONUS BOARDS OF THE GAME BY REACHING A CERTAIN SCORE. AND USES A BONUS MULTIPLIER METHOD DEPENDING ON LOOP DIFFICULTY.

THE THIRD MODE OF PLAY BEGINS WITH AN ALREADY MADE LOOP AND THEN REMOVES RANDOM PIECES OF IT, SO THE PLAYER HAS TO PUT THEM BACK IN WHEN THEY APPEAR AGAIN. IT IS ESSENTIALLY A MEMORY TEST AND LOGIC PUZZLE OF FITTING THE PIECES BACK AS ONE REMEMBERS - ALTHOUGH PLACING A PIECE WHERE IT SEEMS TO FIT IS ALSO OFTEN EFFECTIVE.</desc>

		<name>M.U.L.E.</name>
		<desc>M.U.L.E. IS ABOUT FOUR HOPEFUL EXPLORERS TRYING TO MAKE A FORTUNE ON A VIRGIN PLANET. THIS IS DONE BY PRODUCING VARIOUS GOODS (FOOD, ENERGY, SMITHORE, CRYSTITE). EACH OF THESE GOODS HAVE THEIR USES: IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOOD, YOU WILL HAVE LESS TIME DURING YOUR TURN. IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY, YOUR OUTPUT WILL BE LOWER. IF ENOUGH SMITHORE ISN'T PRODUCED, THERE WILL BE A SHORTAGE OF M.U.L.E.S. CRYSTITE IS THE BIG EARNER THAT CAN MAKE OR BREAK YOUR GAME.

YOU START THE GAME BY SELECTING YOUR RACE. SOME ARE EASIER TO PLAY, SOME HARDER. THERE ARE THREE LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY, IN THE EASIEST THE GAME ONLY LASTS 6 TURNS, BUT THE REAL GAME IS 12 TURNS. CRYSTITE IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THE EASIEST LEVEL.

EACH TURN STARTS WITH LAND CLAIM. EACH PLAYER GETS TO CHOOSE A SPOT OF LAND FOR THEMSELVES FROM THE MAP. IF TWO PLAYERS CHOOSE THE SAME SPOT, THE PLAYER WITH LESS MONEY WINS. THE MAP CONSISTS OF DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE. RIVER IS BEST FOR PRODUCING FOOD, PLAINS FOR ENERGY, MOUNTAINS FOR SMITHORE. CRYSTITE IS HIDDEN AND MUST BE FIRST FOUND BY TAKING A LAND SAMPLE TO THE TOWN.

AFTER THE LAND CLAIM EACH PLAYER TAKES TURNS IN CULTIVATING THEIR LAND AND DO OTHER TASKS. THEY CAN BUY M.U.L.E.S TO START PRODUCTION ON THEIR LAND, SABOTAGE OTHER PLAYERS BY BUYING M.U.L.E.S AND LETTING THEM LOOSE, TRY TO CATCH THE WUMPUS FOR CASH AND TRY TO FIND CRYSTITE VEINS. THE TIME TO DO THESE THINGS DEPENDS ON IF THE PLAYER HAS ENOUGH FOOD. FINALLY THE PLAYER GOES TO THE CASINO AND WINS A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY, DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH TIME WAS LEFT.

AFTER THE CULTIVATION PHASE IS THE PRODUCTION PHASE WHERE EACH LAND PRODUCES AN AMOUNT OF GOODS DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS SUCH AS IF THE PLAYER HAS ENOUGH ENERGY IN STORAGE, WHAT TYPE OF LAND IS USED, AND SOME RANDOM EVENTS SUCH AS SUNSPOTS THAT INCREASE ENERGY OUTPUT. ALSO, IF THE SAME PLAYER HAS PLOTS PRODUCING THE SAME GOODS NEXT TO EACH OTHER, THEY GAIN A BONUS. THREE PLOTS OF SAME PRODUCTION TYPE ANYWHERE ON THE MAP BY THE SAME PLAYER ALSO GIVES A BONUS.

THIRD PHASE IS THE MOST INTERESTING ONE: THE AUCTION. HERE THE PLAYERS BUY AND SELL THEIR GOODS ON OPEN MARKET. PLAYERS NEGOTIATE THE PRICE BY MOVING UP AND DOWN ON THE SCREEN. THE SHOP ALSO HAS PRICES THAT DEPEND ON HOW ABUNDANT OR SCARCE THE GOODS IS. SO IF THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF FOOD, THE PRICE GOES UP AND VICE VERSA. THIS ALLOWS FOR INTERESTING TACTICS, ESPECIALLY IF ONE PLAYER MANAGES TO MONOPOLIZE FOOD, ENERGY OR SMITHORE PRODUCTION. IF THERE IS NO FOOD, OTHERS DON'T HAVE TIME TO CHANGE THEIR PRODUCTION TYPES, IF THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF ENERGY, THEIR LAND WON'T PRODUCE AND IF THERE ARE NO M.U.L.E.S THEY CAN'T CHANGE PRODUCTION TYPE ON THEIR PLOT. HOARDING GOODS ALSO HAS A DRAWBACK IN THE FORM OF SURPLUS WHERE EACH TURN A PERCENTAGE OF GOODS IS WASTED. 

THERE ARE A NUMBER OF RANDOM EVENTS IN THE GAME. SOME AFFECT ONE PLAYER, USUALLY THE ONE WINNING GETS SMALL PENALTIES AND THE LOSING PLAYER(S) GET SMALL REWARDS. THE BIG EVENTS THAT HAPPEN RANDOMLY ARE:
- M.U.L.E. GOES CRAZY - THE M.U.L.E. ON ONE OF THE PLOTS RUNS AWAY LOSING PRODUCTION FOR THAT ROUND PLUS THE MONEY TO REPLACE IT.
- PLANETQUAKE - PRODUCTION OF SMITHORE AND CRYSTITE IS MUCH LOWER.
- FIRE IN STORE - ALL STOCK IN THE SHOPS ARE DESTROYED (WHICH MEANS PRICES WILL SKYROCKET, BUT IF YOU NEEDED TO BUY SOMETHING, YOU ARE AT THE MERCY OF OTHER PLAYERS).
- PIRATE ATTACK - PIRATES STEAL ALL CRYSTITE FROM STORES AND PLAYERS (IN THE EASIEST LEVEL THEY STEAL SMITHORE). NASTY IF YOU HAPPENED TO HAVE A LOT OF THEM WAITING FOR BETTER PRICES.
- ACID RAIN STORM - AFFECTS THE PLOT UNDER THE STORM AND BELOW IT BY BOOSTING FOOD PRODUCTION AND DECREASING ENERGY PRODUCTION.
- SUNSPOT ACTIVITY - INCREASES ENERGY PRODUCTION.
- PEST ATTACK - EATS ALL FOOD ON ONE PLOT.
- METEOR STRIKE - DESTROYS THE M.U.L.E ON THE PLOT IT STRIKES BUT CREATES A VERY RICH CRYSTITE PLOT.

M.U.L.E ALWAYS HAS FOUR PLAYERS, WITH 1-4 HUMAN PLAYERS POSSIBLE AND THE REST PLAYED BY THE AI. BECAUSE THE PLAYERS ONLY NEED TWO BUTTONS AT MOST (UP/DOWN IN AUCTION) IN AUCTION, IT'S EASY TO PLAY WITH FOUR PEOPLE AROUND THE COMPUTER. 

M.U.L.E IS A VERY FINELY TUNED GAME WHERE REWARDS, PENALTIES, TIME TO USE FOR VARIOUS TASKS ETC. HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY FINE TUNED TO KEEP THE GAME BALANCED. RULES AND THE RANDOM EVENTS MEAN THAT NO TWO GAMES ARE THE SAME.</desc>

PLAYERS, REPRESENTED BY MACH RIDER, MUST MAKE THEIR WAY ACROSS TEN SECTORS TO REACH THE CITY BEFORE IT GETS TAKEN OVER BY THE ENEMY. AGGRESSIVE DRIVERS TRY TO FORCE PLAYERS OFF THE ROAD; OBSTACLES, SUCH AS ROCKS, AND THE ROAD'S MANY TURNS ALSO CAN CAUSE PLAYERS TO VEER OFF COURSE. IF DESTROYED, MACH RIDER WILL REFORM HIMSELF SO THAT HE CAN CONTINUE.

THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT PLAY MODES IN MACH RIDER.

ON THE FIGHTING COURSE, THERE ARE TWO PATHS TO CHOOSE FROM. THE GOAL MUST BE REACHED WHILE SHOOTING DOWN ENEMIES OR FORCING THEM OFF THE ROAD; MORE POINTS ARE REWARDED BY BUMPING OFF ENEMIES. UNLIMITED LIVES ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE FIRST STAGE, BUT REMAINING COURSES MUST BE FINISHED IN THREE LIVES OR LESS.

ON THE ENDURANCE AND SOLO COURSES, THERE IS A CERTAIN DISTANCE THAT MUST BE GONE BEFORE THE TIME RUNS OUT. ENEMIES ARE ON THE ENDURANCE COURSE, BUT THE SOLO COURSE IS DEVOID OF ENEMIES.

THERE IS ALSO A LEVEL EDITOR (SIMILAR TO THE ONE IN EXCITEBIKE) THAT ALLOWS CREATION OF ENDURANCE COURSE TRACKS, WHICH ARE ERASED ONCE THE NES IS TURNED OFF.</desc>

ONE DAY, DURING HIS TRAINING, JAKE IS ATTACKED BY SURPRISE BY UNKNOWN FOES WHO KIDNAP ALLISON, HIS GIRLFRIEND. THEN, JAKE HAS TO SAVE HER AND DISCOVER WHAT LIES BEHIND THAT ATTACK.

THIS GAME IS A SIDE-SCROLLING ONE, WITH THE BASIC CONTROLS COMMON TO MANY OF THOSE GAMES THAT FALL IN THE SAME CATEGORY: MOVING, JUMPING AND SHOOTING. YOUR BASIC WEAPON IS SOMETHING LIKE AN ENERGY BALL THAT CAN BE CHARGED BY HOLDING THE BUTTON FOR A FEW SECONDS UNTIL ITS MAXIMUM POWER. ALTHOUGH JAKE IS SUPPOSED TO STILL BE LEARNING HIS MAGIC FROM ZEBEDIAH, FROM THE VERY BEGINNING YOU CAN USE ALL HIS MAGICAL POWERS. YOU CAN SELECT WHICH MAGIC YOU WANT TO USE FROM A LIST, DISPLAYED WHEN YOU PRESS THE START BUTTON. THE MAGICAL POWERS AVAILABLE INCLUDE HEALING, TIME STOPPING, INVINCIBILITY, THE POWER OF THE ELEMENTS (FIRE, WATTER, WIND AND EARTH) AND 3 DIFFERENT METAMORPHOSIS. YOU CAN MORPH INTO A FLYING GUY WHO THROWS SOMETHING LIKE A BOOMERANG (THAT DOESN'T COME BACK), A FISH-LIKE GUY, WHO THROWS SOMETHING LIKE NINJA STARS AND CAN SWIM, AND A FELINE-LIKE GUY, WHO RELEASES ELECTRICAL SHOCKS FROM HIS HANDS AND BECOMES INVINCIBLE WHILE JUMPING. YOU DO NOT EVOLVE DURING THE GAME, AS YOUR HEALTH AND MAGIC BAR DOESN'T GROW.

TOTALLY RAD, AS THE NAME POINTS OUT, IS A GAME FULL OF SLANG, WITH THE CONSTANT USE OF WORDS LIKE TOTALLY, GNARLY, DUDE, EXCELLENT, DECENT, RIGHTEOUS, ETC.</desc>

IT IS A SEQUEL TO A 1984 ARCADE GAME DEVELOPED BY CAPCOM KNOWN AS PIRATE SHIP HIGEMARU. NEITHER THE ARCADE GAME, NOR THIS ADVENTURE ADAPTATION WERE RELEASED OUTSIDE JAPAN, ALTHOUGH A PROTOTYPE EXISTS FOR A CANCELED NORTH AMERICAN NES RELEASE, WHERE IT WAS TO BE RENAMED "MAKAI ISLAND".
IN HIGEMARU MAKAIJIMA, THE HERO FROM PIRATE SHIP HIGEMARU NAMED MOMOTARU MUST NOW PILOT HIS OWN SAILING VESSEL AROUND THE OCEAN SURROUNDING SEVEN ISLANDS. HIS GOAL IS TO FIND THE GREATEST TREASURE. TO DO THIS, HE MUST COLLECT THE KEYS WHICH OPEN THE DOCK GATES TO EACH OF THE ISLANDS BY INVADING SEVERAL PIRATE SHIPS AND DEFEATING THE CAPTAIN ON BOARD IN COMBAT. THE GAMEPLAY ON THESE PIRATE SHIPS ARE TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM THE ARCADE PREDECESSOR, WITH SOME SMALL MODIFICATIONS.
ONCE MOMOTARU HAS COLLECTED A KEY FROM A PIRATE SHIP, HE MUST THEN SAIL AROUND THE ISLANDS IN SEARCH OF THE CORRECT DOCK GATE WHICH THE KEY CORRESPONDS TO. ONCE THERE, THE PLAYER EMBARKS ON AN EXPLORATION OF THE ISLAND TO FIND ITEMS, DEFEAT A BOSS, AND COLLECT TREASURES BEFORE HEADING OFF IN SEARCH OF ANOTHER ISLAND KEY.

		<desc>A PORT OF THE ARCADE GAME. THE IDEA IS DECEPTIVELY SIMPLE: GUIDE A MARBLE DOWN A PATH WITHOUT HITTING ANY OBSTACLES OR STRAYING OFF THE COURSE. THE GAME IS VIEWED FROM AN ISOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE, WHICH MAKES IT HARDER TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE DIRECTION THE BALL IS TO FOLLOW. THERE ARE TIGHT CORRIDORS TO FOLLOW AND ENEMIES TO AVOID. THERE IS A 2-PLAYER MODE IN WHICH PLAYERS MUST RACE TO THE FINISH; OTHERWISE YOU'RE RACING AGAINST THE CLOCK.</desc>

		<desc>BOWSER, THE TOKEN BAD GUY FROM THE MARIO BROS. SERIES, IS UP TO NO GOOD AGAIN IN THIS EDUCATIONAL GAME DESIGNED TO TEACH CHILDREN GEOGRAPHY. THIS TIME HE'S SET UP HIS HEADQUARTERS IN ANTARCTICA AND CREATED PORTALS TO 25 FAMOUS CITIES AROUND THE WORLD, SO THAT HIS KOOPAS CAN WREAK HAVOC IN OUR OWN WORLD. HE'S ALSO KIDNAPPED MARIO, HENCE THE TITLE OF THIS GAME. YOU PLAY AS LUIGI WHO MUST FOIL BOWSER'S PLANS BY ENTERING THROUGH EACH OF THE PORTALS, TRACKING DOWN THE KOOPAS WHO HAVE STOLEN FAMOUS ARTIFACTS, AND LOOKING FOR CLUES ABOUT YOUR LOCATION. ONCE YOU'VE SET EVERYTHING RIGHT AND DETERMINED WHERE YOU ARE, YOU CALL YOSHI ON YOUR GLOBULATOR SO HE CAN TRACK YOU DOWN. YOU NEED YOSHI'S HELP TO EAT THE POKEY (A CACTUS-LIKE CREATURE) THAT'S GUARDING THE RETURN PORTAL, AND WHEN LUIGI RETURNS HE CAN CLOSE THE PORTAL FOREVER.

BY EXPLORING THESE 25 CITIES, CHILDREN CAN FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH THE LANDMARKS AND ARTIFACTS THAT EACH CITY HAS. WHEN LUIGI RETURNS THE STOLEN ARTIFACTS TO THE PROPER PLACES HE CAN EVEN TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THEM. THERE IS ALSO AN ADD-ON DISK YOU CAN PURCHASE THAT ADDS TEN ADDITIONAL CITIES TO THE GAME (IT ORIGINALLY RETAILED FOR $24.95).</desc>

		<name>Mechanized Attack</name>
		<desc>MECHANIZED ATTACK IS AN ADAPTATION OF AN ARCADE SHOOTING GAME WHERE THE PLAYER USES A MACHINE GUN TO STAGE AN ASSAULT ON A TROPICAL ISLAND THAT'S HOME TO A CYBORG ARMY. IN THIS NES PORT, THE PLAYER CAN USE EITHER A GAMEPAD OR THE NES LIGHT ZAPPER TO CARRY OUT THE MISSION. BATTLE THROUGH NUMEROUS STAGES BEGINNING WITH AN APPROACH TO THE ISLAND. THIS FIRST STAGE IS HELD OVER THE WATER AND FEATURES AT ATTACK ON A NUMBER OF SMALL GUNBOATS, A HELICOPTER, AND AN ENTIRE BATTLESHIP. AS THE PLAYER PROGRESSES THROUGH THE STAGES OF THE ISLAND, THE HUMAN (AND EVEN CANINE) ENEMIES ARE REVEALED TO BE ROBOTS WHEN THE FLESH IS DESTROYED. AT VARIOUS JUNCTURES OF THE GAME, THE PLAYER IS ALLOWED TO CHOOSE WHICH GAME PATH TO PURSUE.

WHILE THE ARCADE VERSION OF MECHANIZED ATTACK HAD A MINIATURE MACHINE GUN REPLICA FOR THE PLAYER TO USE, THIS NES ADAPTATION ATTEMPTS TO REPRODUCE THE FEEL BY ALLOWING THE PLAYER TO HOLD DOWN A GAME PAD BUTTON OR THE LIGHT ZAPPER TRIGGER FOR AUTOMATIC FIRE. EXTRA AMMO IS PLENTIFUL SO BE SURE TO FIRE AT THOSE POWER-UP BOXES TO GRAB AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. THERE ARE ALSO MORE POWERFUL GRENADES WHICH ARE IN MUCH SHORTER SUPPLY THAN THE BULLETS.</desc>

IT IS ONE OF THREE PORNOGRAPHIC THEMED GAMES RELEASED BY PANESIAN, ALONG WITH HOT SLOTS AND PEEK A BOO POKER
THE GAMEPLAY IS REMINISCENT OF THAT OF TETRIS AND PUZZLE BOBBLE IN THAT THE GOAL IS TO STEER CLUSTERS OF RISING BUBBLES AND PLACE THEM SO THAT THEY CONNECT TO OTHER BUBBLES OF SIMILAR COLOR ALONG THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. IF THE SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF SIMILAR BUBBLES ARE TOUCHING, THEY WILL BE CLEARED AND ALL FREE NEIGHBORING BUBBLES WILL RISE FURTHER, ALLOWING FOR COMBOS. IF THE ACCUMULATED BUBBLES ON SCREEN REACH THE BOTTOM OF THE PLAYING AREA, THE GAME IS OVER. IF A LEVEL IS COMPLETED, THE PLAYER WILL BE REWARDED WITH EROTICA.
THE ORIGINAL VERSION WAS RELEASED BY C&amp;E THEMSELVES UNDER THE TITLE MAGIC BUBBLE IN 1991. IT WAS LICENSED TO AMERICAN VIDEO ENTERTAINMENT, WHO RELEASED IT IN THE SAME YEAR UNDER THE TITLE MERMAIDS OF ATLANTIS, WITH ALL PORNOGRAPHIC ELEMENTS REMOVED OR OBSCURED. A LOCALIZED VERSION LEAVING ALL PORNOGRAPHIC CONTENT INTACT WAS RELEASED BY HACKER INTERNATIONAL IN JAPAN AS SOAP PANIC AND BY PANESIAN IN THE UNITED STATES AS BUBBLE BATH BABES.
THE GAME IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND AND IS SOUGHT AFTER BY COLLECTORS, OFTEN TOPPING PRICES OF $1000 U.S. DOLLARS ON AUCTION SITES SUCH AS EBAY.</desc>

AS FOX-HOUND'S (AN ELITE BLACK OPS UNIT) NEWEST RECRUIT, GOING BY THE CODENAME OF SOLID SNAKE, YOUR MISSION IS TO INFILTRATE OUTER HEAVEN AND RESCUE YOUR MISSING COMRADE, GREY FOX (WHO WAS CAPTURED AFTER A FAILED INFILTRATION), WHILE GATHERING INTELLIGENCE ON METAL GEAR. IN ORDER TO FULFILL YOUR OBJECTIVE, YOU MUST COLLECT VARIOUS WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENTS (INCLUDING KEYCARDS FOR FURTHER ACCESS INTO THE FORTRESS), WHILE AVOIDING VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE ENEMY. THE PLAYER MUST ALSO CONFRONT AGAINST BOSSES IN THE FORM OF OUTER HEAVEN'S ELITE MERCENARY FORCE AND RESCUE HOSTAGES HIDDEN WITHIN THE FORTRESS IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR RANK, WHICH GIVES THE PLAYER AN EXTENDED LIFE BAR AND INCREASED STORAGE CAPACITY FOR REPLENISHABLE ITEMS AND AMMO. THE PLAYER CAN USE A WIRELESS TRANSCEIVER TO COME IN TOUCH WITH THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER, BIG BOSS, TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR CURRENT MISSION OBJECTIVES OR CONTACT ONE OF THE LOCAL RESISTANCE MEMBERS OPERATING COVERTLY WITHIN THE FORTRESS TO GAIN USEFUL TIPS AND INSIGHTS.</desc>

WHILE THE GAME IS ONLY SEVEN LEVELS LONG, THE DIFFICULTY RAMPS UP QUICKLY, SO MASTERY OF THE GRAVITY TECHNIQUE AND MEMORIZATION OF THE LEVELS BECOME ABSOLUTE NECESSITIES FOR SURVIVAL.</desc>

GOOFY ASSISTS WITH CHAUFFEUR AND DATA PROCESSING DUTIES. MICKEY CAN VENTURE INTO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING 6 TERRITORIES: YUKON, SWAMP, FOREST, JUNGLE, PYRAMID, AND CARIBBEAN. IN EACH AREA, HIS MISSION IS TO COLLECT THREE DIAMONDS THAT CONTAIN LETTERS. DOING SO WILL SPELL A WORD. THEN, MICKEY VENTURES TO THE END OF THE LEVEL AND COLLECTS A LARGE SLAB. IF MICKEY COLLECTS THE THREE DIAMONDS IN THE STAGE TO SPELL A 3-LETTER WORD, MICKEY SPELLS THE WORD WITH DIGITIZED AUDIO SAMPLES AND SAYS THE WORD, COMPLETE WITH AN ILLUSTRATION. THEN, THE SLAB THAT MICKEY COLLECTED AT THE END OF THE STAGE IS FED BY GOOFY THROUGH A LARGE MACHINE THAT SPITS OUT A LETTER. IT IS UP TO THE PLAYER TO IDENTIFY WHICH LETTER THIS IS.

THIS GAME IS ORIENTED TOWARDS VERY YOUNG CHILDREN. AS SUCH, IT IS ESSENTIALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FAIL. THERE ARE MANY ENEMIES IN THE GAME BUT NONE ACTUALLY INFLICT HARM. SNAKES, PORCUPINES, HIPPOS, ALLIGATORS, AND EVEN BABY SEALS-- MICKEY JUST BOUNCES OFF EACH. MICKEY CAN ALSO SWIM HANDILY AND SUSTAIN LONG FALLS.

FURTHER, THE GAME ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO POINT AT LETTERS ON A BOARD AND HAVE MICKEY SAY THEM USING THE CARTRIDGE'S LIBRARY OF DIGITIZED MOUSE VOICE SAMPLES.</desc>

THIS IS THE FIRST GAME IN THE  MIGHT AND MAGIC SERIES, AND ONE OF THE PROTOTYPES OF ROLE-PLAYING GAMES IN GENERAL. THE ENTIRE GAME IS VIEWED FROM FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE. THE PLAYER CREATES A PARTY OF SIX ADVENTURERS, WITH TRADITIONAL CLASSES TO CHOOSE FROM (FIGHTER, CLERIC, ETC.). THE PLAYER ALSO SPECIFIES THE GENDER AND THE AGE OF THE CHARACTERS - THEY GROW OLD AND WILL EVENTUALLY DIE OF NATURAL CAUSES. AS IN MOST RPGS, THE GAMEPLAY REVOLVES AROUND EXPLORING THE GAME WORLD, PERFORMING QUESTS, AND LEVELING UP TO BE ABLE TO PROCEED TO THE STORY-ADVANCING CHALLENGES. THE TURN-BASED BATTLES TYPICALLY TAKE PLACE AGAINST SIX MONSTERS, BUT ENEMY REINFORCEMENTS CAN APPEAR ONCE THEIR COMRADES HAVE BEEN SLAIN.</desc>

ALSO EXCLUSIVE TO THIS PARTICULAR FINAL FIGHT GAME IS THE EXPERIENCE SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWS GAINING LEVELS TO LEARN ADDITIONAL MOVES, SIMILAR TO THE FIRST DOUBLE DRAGON GAME. THE CHARACTERS HAVE ALL BEEN SQUISHED DOWN TO SUPER-DEFORMED 8-BIT LIKENESSES.  GRAPHICALLY THIS LOOKS SIMILAR TO RIVER CITY RANSOM. EACH CHARACTER HAS A BUTTON FOR ATTACK AND A BUTTON FOR JUMPING.

THE MAN'S NAME WAS GEORGE, THE WOMAN'S NAME WAS MARIA. TWO YEARS PASSED, AND GEORGE SUDDENLY RETURNED. HE NEVER SPOKE TO ANYONE ABOUT WHAT HE HAD EXPERIENCED. INSTEAD, HE LEAD A SOLITARY LIFE AND BEGAN AN ODD STUDY, ALL BY HIMSELF. HIS WIFE NEVER RETURNED.

EIGHTY YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN. YOU PLAY THE ROLE OF A YOUNG BOY WHO LIVES IN A SMALL TOWN TOGETHER WITH HIS PARENTS AND HIS TWO SISTERS. ONE DAY, SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENS: THE HOUSE SEEMS TO BE POSSESSED BY A POLTERGEIST. THINGS START ATTACKING HOUSE INHABITANTS.

		<desc>IN 1982, A SEQUEL TO THE  INCREDIBLY POPULAR PAC-MAN WAS INTRODUCED IN THE FORM OF HIS GIRLFRIEND, MS. PAC-MAN.  THIS SEQUEL CONTINUED ON THE "EAT THE DOTS/AVOID THE GHOSTS" GAMEPLAY OF THE ORIGINAL GAME, BUT ADDED NEW FEATURES TO KEEP THE TITLE FRESH.

LIKE HER BOYFRIEND, MS. PAC-MAN ATTEMPTS TO CLEAR FOUR VARIOUS AND CHALLENGING MAZES FILLED WITH DOTS AND EVER-MOVING BOUNCING FRUIT  WHILE AVOIDING INKY, BLINKY, PINKY AND SUE, EACH WITH THEIR OWN PERSONALITIES AND TACTICS.  ONE TOUCH FROM ANY OF THESE GHOSTS MEANS A LOSS OF LIFE FOR MS. PAC-MAN.

MS. PAC-MAN CAN TURN THE TABLES ON HER PURSUERS BY EATING ONE OF THE FOUR ENERGIZERS LOCATED WITHIN THE MAZE. DURING THIS TIME, THE GHOSTS TURN BLUE, AND MS. PAC-MAN CAN EAT THEM FOR BONUS POINTS (RANGING FROM 200, 400, 800 AND 1600, PROGRESSIVELY). THE ENERGIZER POWER ONLY LASTS FOR A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME, AS THE GHOST'S EYES FLOAT BACK TO THEIR CENTER BOX, AND REGENERATE TO CHASE AFTER MS. PAC-MAN AGAIN.

SURVIVE A FEW ROUNDS OF GAMEPLAY, AND THE PLAYER WILL BE TREATED TO HUMOROUS INTERMISSIONS SHOWING THE GROWING ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAC-MAN AND MS. PAC-MAN, LEADING ALL THE WAY UP TO THE ARRIVAL OF "JUNIOR".</desc>

		<desc>NARC IS A 1-2 PLAYER GAME, WHERE YOUR MISSION IS TO INFILTRATE THE MR. BIG CORPORATION, THE SCOURGE OF THE UNDERWORLD. TO DO THIS, YOU MUST GET THROUGH THE GAME'S EIGHT STAGES, WITH OVER TEN SECTORS LIKE THE JUNKYARD, SUBWAY, DRUG LAB, NURSERY, DOWNTOWN, SUNSET STRIP, AND EVEN THE CORPORATION, WHERE MR. BIG RESIDES. IN ORDER TO GET THROUGH THE STAGES, YOU ARE REQUIRED TO COLLECT A NUMBER OF SAFE CARDS, AND INSERT THEM IN THE SLOT NEXT TO THE STAGE EXIT.  EACH SECTOR INCLUDES A MAP, AND SHOULD BE EASY TO READ. FOR EXAMPLE, THE BLUE OR RED DOTS REPRESENT YOU, AND THE WHITE DOTS ARE THE MISSILE LAUNCHERS, WHILE THE "E" INDICATES THE EXIT.

YOUR MISSION AIN'T GOING TO BE EASY, AS YOU WILL COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH ENEMIES INCLUDING THE CANINE MUTTS, DAS LOF GANG, DR. SPIKE RUSH, JOE ROCKHEAD, KINKY PINKY, SGT. SKYHIGH, HQ POSSE, AND MR. BIG HIMSELF. YOU HAVE TWO WAYS YOU CAN DEAL WITH THEM: EITHER PUT A BULLET IN THEM OR MAKE ARRESTS. FURTHERMORE, THEY WILL TRY TO BLOW YOU UP THE MINUTE THEY SEE YOU. FORTUNATELY, YOU'RE ARMED WITH A SHOTGUN AND MISSILE LAUNCHER, BUT THESE BOTH HAVE A LIMITED SUPPLY OF AMMUNITION. IF YOUR BULLET COUNTER REACHES ONE, YOU CAN ONLY FIRE ONE BULLET AT A TIME, SO YOU NEED TO FIND SOME MORE. ALSO, IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO WASTE ALL OF YOUR MISSILES: YOU MIGHT NEED THEM LATER WHEN YOU DEAL WITH LATER ENEMIES LIKE MR. BIG. YOU ARE ALSO BACKED UP BY A CHOPPER AND A MEAN SHINY STREET MACHINE.

MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, WHEN YOU BLOW UP ENEMIES, YOU CAN PICK UP SEVERAL ITEMS THAT THEY DROP, INCLUDING DRUGS, MONEY, AMMUNITION, MISSILE LAUNCHERS, AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY, SAFE CARDS.  EVEN IF YOU GOT THE SAFE CARD AND CAN PASS THE LEVEL, YOU CAN KEEP BLOWING UP ENEMIES TO SCORE MORE POINTS. ACCORDING TO THE GAME, THIS GAME IS FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY, SO YOU WILL NOT GET EMPLOYED BY YOUR LOCAL DEA OFFICE. IS THIS WHAT THE DEA DOES EVERY DAY: GO ON RAMPAGES?</desc>

YOU CAN EVEN SUBSTITUTE SECOND-STRINGERS FOR THE "SKILL" POSITIONS (QB, RB, WR, TE, AND FS/SS) WHEN YOUR STARTERS GET TIRED.

PLAY PERSPECTIVE IS VERY UNUSUAL: TOP-DOWN SLIGHTLY MODIFIED WITH A THREE-QUARTERS TILT BEHIND THE OFFENSE, AND THE SCROLLING IS DIAGONAL, FROM THE BOTTOM LEFT TO UPPER RIGHT OF THE SCREEN.  EACH TEAM HAS 12 PASSING AND 12 RUNNING PLAYS ON OFFENSE, AND THE OPTION TO REVERSE PLAY DESIGNS EFFECTIVELY GIVES YOU A TOTAL OF 48 POTENTIAL PLAYS TO RUN.  THE DEFENSE HAS 8 COVER PLAYS AND 8 BLITZES TO SELECT FROM.  THE KICKING AND PUNTING GAMES ARE HANDLED WITH A FAIRLY TYPICAL DIRECTIONAL ARROW/POWER METER SYSTEM.

GAMES ARE DIVIDED INTO FOUR 15-MINUTE (ACCELERATED REAL-TIME) QUARTERS.  THERE ARE NO PENALTIES, BUT REFEREES DO APPEAR ONSCREEN TO SIGNAL TOUCHDOWNS/FIELD GOALS, TAKE MEASUREMENTS ON SHORT YARDAGE PLAYS, AND SHOUT "FIRST DOWN!" (IN AUDIO) WHENEVER A TEAM MOVES THE CHAINS.  TEAM STATS ARE DISPLAYED ON A SUMMARY SCREEN AFTER EVERY QUARTER OF PLAY.  HIGHEST SCORING TEAM WINS, WHICH IN PLAYOFFS MODE MEANS MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ROUND--AND AN EVENTUAL SHOT AT WINNING IT ALL IN THE POWER BOWL!</desc>

		<desc>NEW GHOSTBUSTERS II FOLLOWS LOOSELY THE ORIGINAL IVAN REITMAN'S FILM PLOT. YOU START OUT BY SELECTING TWO GHOSTBUSTERS OUT OF  FIVE (THE 5TH ONE IS LOUIS TULLY). THE FIRST, PLAYER CONTROLLED BUSTER WILL USE PROTON PACK AND SECOND, CONTROLLED BY AI, USES THE TRAP WHERE GHOSTS END UP, AFTER BEEN FREEZED BY USING THE PROTON PACK. PLAYER CONTROLLED BUSTER CAN GET HURT, IF TOUCHED BY A GHOST, WHILE AI BUSTER CAN'T. 

THE GAME'S PERSPECTIVE IS TOP-DOWN, WHERE YOU MOVE FROM A ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER AND GET RID OF GHOSTS. THE TYPE OF GHOSTS VARY. AFTER EVERY LEVEL YOU HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST A BOSS, USUALLY SOMEONE FROM THE MOVIE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FIRST COURTHOUSE LEVEL YOU FIGHT AGAINST THE SCOLERI BROTHERS. 

THE GAME CONTAINS SIX LEVELS, INSPIRED BY THE MOVIE:THE COURTHOUSE
2. SUBWAYS

		<name>Ninja Gaiden III : The Ancient Ship of Doom</name>
		<desc>THIS IS THE THIRD ENTRY IN THE SERIES OF FAST-PACED NINJA ACTION GAMES, AND IS THE LAST GAME IN THE SERIES TO BE RELEASED ON THE NINTENDO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM.

SOME TIME HAS PASSED SINCE THE DEFEAT OF ASHTAR AND THE RESURRECTED JAQUIO, AND IRENE LEW HAS RECEIVED A NEW MISSION TO COMPLETE. SHE IS TO OBSERVE A STRANGE FACTORY THAT HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED RECENTLY FOR AN UNKNOWN PURPOSE, AND INVESTIGATE IT. SHE PROCEEDS TO RECONNOITER IT, BUT IS INTERCEPTED AND APPARENTLY ASSASSINATED BY HER FRIEND RYU HAYABUSA...EXCEPT IT ISN'T RYU. IT IS AN IMPOSTER. THE REAL RYU, ANGERED OVER HER DEATH, AND THE SUBSEQUENT FALSE ACCUSATION THAT HE MURDERED HER, CONTINUES HER MISSION AND PROCEEDS TO INVESTIGATE THE FACTORY.

AS STATED, THIS WAS THE LAST GAME IN THE REGULAR SERIES PRODUCED FOR THE NES. IT HAD MANY FEATURES THE PREVIOUS GAMES IN THE SERIES DID NOT, SUCH AS A POWER UP TO EXTEND THE LENGTH OF YOUR SWORD, A NEW VERTICAL "WAVE" ATTACK AND VERTICALLY-SCROLLING LEVELS. THE US VERSION OF THE GAME IS REPUTED TO BE THE HARDEST IN THE SERIES, DUE TO THE EXTRA DAMAGE INCURRED WHEN HIT, SLIGHTLY SHORTER REGULAR SWORD LENGTH, LIMITED CONTINUES AND MORE ENEMIES.

THE LYNX PORT IS THE SECOND NINJA GAIDEN GAME ON THE PLATFORM, THE FIRST BEING A PORT FROM THE ARCADE VERSION. THIS PORT IS IDENTICAL TO THE NES GAME, BUT THE IN-GAME PICTURE IS COMPRESSED FOR THE SMALLER SCREEN OF THE LYNX.</desc>

WHEN RYU LEARNS OF THIS, HE EMBARKS ON A QUEST TO FIND OUT WHO KILLED HIS FATHER AND WHY. THIS QUEST TAKES HIM TO AMERICA TO FIND AN ARCHAEOLOGIST WITH WHOM RYU'S FATHER WAS WORKING. FROM THERE, RYU BECOMES EMBROILED IN AN EVIL, SUPERNATURAL CONSPIRACY INVOLVING A VILLAIN NAMED JAQUIO WHO HAS PLANS TO USE AN ANCIENT CASTLE AND SOME RELICS TO UNLEASH A TERRIFYING EVIL UPON THE WORLD.

NINJA GAIDEN IS A SIDE SCROLLING GAME WHERE RYU THE NINJA CAN RUN, JUMP, AND SLASH WITH HIS NINJA SWORD. HE CAN ALSO ATTACH TO ANY VERTICAL SURFACE. POWERUPS ARE LITTERED THROUGHOUT THE LANDSCAPE THAT ALLOW RYU TO TOSS FIREBALLS AND NINJA STARS, AND PERFORM OTHER FEATS.

RYU WILL BATTLE THROUGH URBAN CITY SETTINGS, FORESTS, JUNGLES, SNOW COVERED CASTLES, UNDERGROUND RAILROADS, AND ANCIENT CASTLES. A MAJOR FEATURE IN NINJA GAIDEN ARE THE CINEMATIC SCENES -- SOMETIMES FULLSCREEN -- THROUGH WHICH THE STORYLINE UNFOLDS.</desc>

THE GAME BEGINS IN AN OVERHEAD MAP THAT ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO WANDER INTO VARIOUS SIDE-SCROLLING LEVELS. THE LEVELS GO ON AN ON UNTIL THE PLAYER COMPLETES A PARTICULAR TASK THAT MAKES A DOOR APPEAR. GOING THROUGH THE DOOR SOMETIMES LEADS OUTSIDE TO THE OVERHEAD MAP AND SOMETIMES LEADS TO A BOSS BATTLE.

THE FIRST GAME PLAYED IS A VERSION OF SUPER MARIO BROS. IN WHICH THE PLAYER IS GIVEN 99 LIVES AND THE GOAL OF COLLECTING 50 COINS IN THE FIRST LEVEL. UPON COLLECTING THE 50TH COIN, THE "FINISHED THE CASTLE" MUSIC WILL PLAY AND A SCORE WILL BE DISPLAYED.

THE SECOND GAME PLAYED IS COURSE 1 OF RAD RACER, USING THE 328 TWIN TURBO VEHICLE. THE PLAYER MUST FINISH THE COURSE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. NO CLOCK IS SHOWN IN THE GAME BUT THE CARTRIDGE KEEPS TRACK INTERNALLY. AFTER FINISHING RAD RACER, ITS SCORE IS DISPLAYED, MULTIPLIED BY 10 AND ADDED TO THE PREVIOUS SUPER MARIO BROS. SCORE.

LAST UP IS NINTENDO'S TETRIS IN A-TYPE MODE. ALL REMAINING TIME FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP IS PLAYED OUT HERE. THE PLAYER'S OBJECTIVE IS SIMPLY TO GET THE BEST SCORE. THE TETRIS SCORE IS MULTIPLIED BY 25 AND ADDED TO THE PREVIOUS SUPER MARIO BROS. AND RAD RACER SCORES.

AFTER ALL THE TIME RUNS OUT, A SCREEN WILL DISPLAY "TIME!" AND DISPLAY THE FINAL SCORE, A SUM OF THE PREVIOUS SCORES AND THEIR MULTIPLIERS.</desc>

IN THE GAME YOU ALWAYS STEER ONLY ONE CHARACTER, WHICH YOU CHOOSE BEFORE THE MATCH STARTS. YOU CAN THEN GIVE SIMPLE ORDERS TO YOU TEAM-MATES, LIKE PASS, TACKLE AND SHOOT. YOUR MOVES ARE ALSO LIMITED TO THESE MOVES. THE GAME IS TOTALLY LAWLESS, SO FEEL FREE TO MAKE ELBOW TACKLES WITHOUT A WINK FROM THE REFEREE.

		<name>Nobunaga's Ambition II</name>
		<desc>NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION II IS THE SEQUEL TO NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION. THE SETTING IS 16TH CENTURY FEUDAL JAPAN, A PERIOD WHEN RUTHLESS DAIMYO (FEUDAL LORDS) CONTENDED WITH EACH OTHER FOR DOMINANCE. ULTIMATELY, THE WINNER IN THIS STRUGGLE WILL BECOME SHOGUN AND HOLD ACTUAL POWER OVER THE ISLANDS, WHILE BEING NOMINALLY SUBJECT TO THE EMPEROR.

THE GAME CASTS THE PLAYER AS ONE OF THE DAIMYO, ALLOWING THEM FREEDOM TO DECIDE THE FATE AND FUTURE OF FEUDAL JAPAN, THROUGH DIPLOMACY AND ULTIMATELY WAR. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO UNIFY JAPAN UNDER THE PLAYER'S RULE. IF THE PLAYER FAILS THROUGH DEATH ON THE BATTLEFIELD, ASSASSINATION AT THE HANDS OF A NINJA, OR THROUGH NATURAL CAUSES, THEY CAN CHOOSE A SUCCESSOR AND PLAY ON. FUNCTIONALLY, THE FIRST JOB IS TO LET PROSPER THE FIEF (PROVINCE) UNDER THE PLAYER'S CONTROL THROUGH AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT AND TOWN INVESTMENT. 

THERE ARE TWO SCENARIOS AVAILABLE IN THE GAME: 

1. WARLORDS: 1560 A.D.
THE FIRST SCENARIO BEGINS AS THE DAIMYO PREPARE WHAT WILL EVENTUALLY BECOME A FULL SCALE WAR IN THE WHOLE OF JAPAN. THE WARRING STATES PERIOD BEGINS HERE. THERE ARE 28 OF THEM INCLUDED IN THE SCENARIO, AMONG OTHERS: THE MORI CLAN, THE TAKEDA, THE HOJO CLAN, THE UESUGI CLAN, ETC.

NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: 1582 A.D.
THE SECOND SCENARIO FOLLOWS THE RISE OF ODA NOBUNAGA IN 1582 A.D. TO POWER AND ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO PLAY EITHER AS ODA NOBUNAGA OR AS ONE OF HIS CHIEF ALLIES OR RIVALS. 

SAMURAI
THE GAME IMPROVES ON ITS PREDECESSOR BY INCLUDING SOME 400 HISTORICAL SAMURAI IN THE GAME, PROVIDING THE PLAYER WITH GENERALS FOR TROOPS AND GOVERNORS FOR A CONQUERED FIEF. 

EACH SAMURAI IS CHARACTERIZED BY STATISTICS: AGE, RANK, BODY POINTS, WAR, POLITICS, AMBITION, CHARISMA, AND LOYALTY. THERE ARE ALSO ADDITIONAL ATTRIBUTES FOR SPECIFIC MILITARY PURPOSES: SKILL, ARMS LEVEL, AND UNIT TYPE. SOME OF THESE ATTRIBUTES MAY BE IMPROVED THROUGH TRAINING (I.E. WAR, POLITICS, AND SKILL), REWARDS (I.E. LOYALTY), OR THROUGH MERCHANTS (I.E. ARMS LEVEL). 

STRATEGY
THE GAME IS TURN-BASED, WITH EACH TURN REPRESENTING ONE MONTH. CERTAIN EVENTS TAKE PLACE ANNUALLY SUCH AS TAX COLLECTING (MARCH) AND RICE HARVEST (SEPTEMBER), WHILE OTHER EVENTS, SUCH AS INVADING NEIGHBORS, FOLLOWS THE PLAYER'S TIME TABLE.

THE GAME USES AN INITIATIVE SYSTEM TO DETERMINE WHAT ACTIONS CAN BE COMPLETED IN A PARTICULAR MONTH. EACH DAIMYO AND SAMURAI HAS A STOCK OF "BODY POINTS" THAT REPRESENT THE ATTENTION HE CAN AFFORD TO SPEND ON AN ACTION. EACH ACTION HAS A COST IN BODY POINTS FOR THE CHARACTER EXECUTING IT, AND IF HE DOES NOT HAVE THE POINTS NECESSARY, HE MAY NOT PERFORM IT. BODY POINTS ARE REFRESHED A LITTLE EACH MONTH. THE LEVEL OF BODY POINTS REFRESHED PER MONTH IS DEPENDS ON THE LEVEL OF HIS POLITICAL SKILL. INTENSIVE OPERATIONS WILL DEPLETE BODY POINTS AND THEN REQUIRE TURNS OF INACTION TO STOCK UP AGAIN, SO TIMING ACTIONS TO COINCIDE WITH BODY POINT AVAILABILITY IS AN EXTRA WRINKLE TO THE MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES.

COMBAT
EACH SAMURAI CAN LEAD A 100-STRONG UNIT, WHICH MUST BE RECRUITED, THEN TRAINED, AND EQUIPPED WITH WEAPONS FOR BATTLE. THE ATTACK OF AN ARMY RESULTS IN A TACTICAL PLAY OUT OF THE RESULTING BATTLE OR SIEGE. A HEX-BASED MAP OF THE AREA OF THE BATTLEFIELD WILL FORM THE PLAYING BOARD FOR THE MOVEMENT TO COMBAT AND ACTUAL FIGHTING. FORTIFICATIONS (CASTLES) HAVE A DRAMATIC BENEFIT FOR THE DEFENDER. THE ATTACKER MUST DEFEAT THE DEFENDER WITHIN 30 DAYS OR MUST FORCE A WITHDRAWAL. ADDITIONALLY, BOTH SIDES MUST PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR FOOD PROVISIONS AS EACH DAY SUBTRACTS FOOD SUPPLIES IN ACCORDANCE TO THEIR ARMY SIZE.

UNIT TYPES
THE GAME INTRODUCES 3 BASIC MILITARY UNIT TYPES: INFANTRY (INF), CAVALRY (CAV), AND RIFLES (RIF). EACH UNIT TYPE HAS CERTAIN SPECIAL ABILITIES AND TACTICAL ADVANTAGES/DISADVANTAGES IN COMBAT:

1. INFANTRY HAVE THE ABILITY TO AMBUSH ANYWHERE ON THE MAIN FIEF MAP (EXPLAINED LATER) AND HAVE 4 MOVEMENT POINTS; 
CAVALRY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHARGE AT AN ENEMY (INFLICTING CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE ON BOTH SIDES) WITH THE CHANCE OF BREAKING THROUGH THE DEFENDING UNIT AND EMERGING ON THE OTHER SIDE. SAMURAI LEADERS MAY OFTEN BE KILLED (INSTEAD OF CAPTURED) IF THEIR UNIT REACHES ZERO. CAVALRY HAVE 6 MOVEMENT POINTS; RIFLES MAY ATTACK USING MUSKETS WHICH HAVE DEVASTATING OFFENSIVE CAPABILITIES, WHICH MAY ALSO KILL AN ENEMY SAMURAI UNIT IF THE OPPONENT'S UNIT REACHES ZERO (THUS, A STANDARD NON-RIFLE ATTACK IS ALSO AVAILABLE FOR CAPTURING AN ENEMY SAMURAI LEADER). RIFLES HAVE 3 MOVEMENT POINTS.

 
ADDITIONALLY, BOTH INFANTRY AND RIFLE UNITS MAY MOVE OVER WALLS OR THROUGH WATER DURING THE CASTLE SIEGE FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MOVEMENT POINTS.

TACTICAL COMBAT
TACTICAL COMBAT OCCURS IN TWO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS:

THE FIRST IS THE TACTICAL MAP OF THE FIEF, WHERE THE ATTACKERS FIRST ARRIVE AND THE DEFENDERS SURROUNDING THE CASTLE. IN THIS SETTING, EACH DAYS IS DIVIDED INTO THREE TIME PERIODS: MORNING, AFTERNOON, AND NIGHT, BEFORE THE DAY ENDS. AT NIGHT, ARMIES MAY MANEUVER TO SURPRISE ATTACK ENEMIES IN THE DARK, WHICH DOES CONSIDERABLY MORE DAMAGE THAN AN AVERAGE ATTACK. THIS MAY BE DONE IF THE ENEMY IS AT LEAST TWO SQUARES AWAY (NOT ADJACENT).

THE SECOND IS THE CASTLE SIEGE MAP, WHICH OCCURS IF THE DEFENDER CHOOSES TO RETREAT TO THE CASTLE FROM THE PREVIOUS MAP. HERE, EACH TURN REPRESENTS ONE DAY, THUS THE TIME LIMIT OF THE ATTACK AS WELL AS THE PROVISIONS OF BOTH SIDES, RAPIDLY DECREASE WITH EACH TURN. IN THIS SETTING, THE SIEGE FORCE MUST BREAK DOWN GATES LEADING TOWARDS THE CASTLE FOR THE FINAL ENGAGEMENT. THE DEFENDER IS DEFEATED, IF THE GOVERNOR OF THE FIEF RETREATS, OR IF HIS UNIT IS DESTROYED: RESULTING EITHER IN HIS CAPTURE OR DEATH.

THE END OUTCOME IS EITHER THE FALL OF THE FIEF TO THE ATTACKING FORCES OR VICTORY FOR THE DEFENDERS. EITHER WAY, CAPTURED SAMURAI (IF ANY) WILL REQUIRE A PROMPT RESPONSE FOR RELEASE, BEHEADING, OR RECRUITMENT TO THE WINNER'S FORCE.</desc>

		<name>Nobunaga's Ambition</name>
		<desc>IN THE 16TH CENTURY, JAPAN'S SENGOKU ("WARRING STATES") PERIOD DIVIDED THE NATION INTO NUMEROUS FEUDAL STATES, EACH RULED BY A DAIMYO. THESE DAIMYOS WOULD OFTEN GO TO WAR WITH EACH OTHER. MANY DREAMT OF CONQUERING THE LAND, BECOMING THE SHOGUN AND RULING THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. ONE OF THOSE DAIMYOS WAS THE AMBITIOUS NOBUNAGA ODA, A MERCILESS RULER AND A RENOWNED STRATEGIST. PLAYERS TAKE ON THE ROLE OF NOBUNAGA ODA OR ONE OF MANY OTHER DAIMYOS TO TRY TO CONQUER JAPAN. 

NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION IS A TURN-BASED STRATEGY GAME WHICH CAN BE PLAYED IN DIFFERENT MODES. GAMEPLAY IS SIMILAR TO KOEI'S BETTER KNOWN ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS GAME. PLAYERS BEGIN BY SELECTING EITHER A 17 REGIONS SCENARIO OR A LARGER 50 SCENARIO. THEN, THE PLAYER MUST SELECT A DAIMYO, EACH OF WHICH IS RATED ATTRIBUTES IN SEVERAL CATEGORIES; AGE, HEALTH, AMBITION, LUCK, CHARM AND IQ. AS THE GAME PROGRESSES, THESE VALUES CHANGE DEPENDING ON EVENTS IN THE GAME. THE AGE VALUE REPRESENTS A TIME LIMIT OF SORTS, AS AN ELDERLY DAIMYO BECOMES INCREASINGLY LIKELY TO DIE OF OLD AGE OR SICKNESS.

DURING EACH OF TURN (ONE PER SEASON), PLAYERS CAN ISSUE ONE OF SEVERAL COMMANDS FROM A MENU. THEY INCLUDE: RECRUITING NEW SOLDIERS, TRAINING THE ARMY, BUYING  WEAPONS, INCREASING PEASANT MORALE, FORMING ALLIANCES OR HIRING NINJAS TO BRIBE &amp; ASSASSINATE. WHEN ONE PLAYER ATTACKS ANOTHER, THERE IS A WAR FOUGHT OVER THE DEFENDER'S REGION. BATTLES ARE FOUGHT IN AN OVERHEAD-VIEW HEX BATTLE MAP. EACH PLAYER TAKES TURN MOVING UNITS AND ISSUING ORDERS, WHICH INCLUDE ATTACK, MOVE, BRIBE AND SURRENDER. THE GOAL IS TO DEFEAT ALL OF THE ENEMY UNITS (OR FORCE THEM INTO SURRENDER). ARMY UNITS EACH HAVE A CERTAIN WEAKNESS AGAINST OTHER TYPES OF ENEMIES, AND ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY THE TERRAIN.</desc>

		<desc>BASED ON THE BELGIAN COMIC BOOK, "LES TUNIQUES BLEUES", THIS STRATEGY GAME ALLOWS YOU TO REPLAY THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR FROM BOTH THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH SIDES.

IN THE STRATEGY PART OF THE GAME, YOU CAN MOVE YOUR TROOPS ON A MAP OF THE US. IF TWO OPPOSING ARMIES ENTER THE SAME STATE, THE BATTLE IS PLAYED OUT IN AN ACTION SEQUENCE. ADDITIONAL ACTION SEQUENCES MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED WHEN CAPTURING AN ENEMY FORT OR TRAIN.

JUST LIKE IN ZELDA II, THERE IS A TOP-DOWN MAP OF GREECE WITH TOWNS AND OTHER LOCATIONS TO EXPLORE. EACH OF THESE HAS SIDE-SCROLLING SECTIONS IN WHICH ORPHEUS FIGHTS HIS WAY THROUGH THE MINIONS OF HADES. THERE ARE VARIOUS ITEMS ONE MUST GET TO CONTINUE TO THE NEXT LOCATION, INCLUDING SWORDS, SHIELDS AND CRYSTALS. THERE ARE THREE FRAGMENTS OF LOVE HIDDEN AROUND; ORPHEUS HAS TO FIND THEM BEFORE HE CAN ENTER TARTARUS AND FIGHT HADES TO SAVE HIS BELOVED HELENE.

THE MONSTERS OF THE GAME ARE ALSO BASED ON THE GREEK MYTHOLOGY AND IT IS PRETTY ENTERTAINING TO CONFRONT CYCLOPES, MINOTAURS AND PEGASUSES.</desc>

		<desc>YOU HAVE BEEN RECRUITED FOR OPERATION WOLF, A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO RESCUE PRISONERS FROM THE ENEMY. THROUGH A SERIES OF MISSIONS, YOU'LL ENGAGE A VARIETY OF ENEMIES, FROM SOLDIERS TO NINJAS, PATROL BOATS TO HELICOPTERS, AND MORE. CAN YOU CARRY THE DAY?

OPERATION WOLF IS AN ARCADE CONVERSION OF THE GAME BY TAITO. IT IS ESSENTIALLY A BITMAPPED "RAIL-SHOOTER", WHERE YOU BASICALLY HOLD THE GUN AND SHOOT JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT MOVES, WHILE CONSERVING YOUR AMMO AND GRENADES. SHOOT AMMO/GRENADES AND HEALING ITEMS ON THE SCREEN TO "PICK THEM UP". YOUR PRIMARY MACHINE GUN CAN KILL EVERYTHING IF YOU HIT IT ENOUGH TIMES, BUT YOU CAN ALSO USE THE GRENADE LAUNCHER FOR REALLY DEADLY TARGETS LIKE HELICOPTERS OR ARMORED CARS. YOU CAN COLLECT A MACHINE GUN WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO SHOOT FASTER FOR A FEW SECONDS. 

YOU'LL BE PUMMELLED BY A LOT OF ENEMIES. SOME WILL BE SHOOTING, OTHERS WILL BE TOSSING GRENADES, KNIFES, AND MORE. SOME ARE ARMORED AND REQUIRES MORE THAN A FEW HITS, OTHERS DODGES. YOU CAN SHOOT GRENADES AND KNIFES OUT OF THE AIR IF YOU AIM WELL ENOUGH. THERE ARE ALSO CIVILIANS RUNNING AROUND WHICH CAN BE SHOT, BUT IT'S NOT BENEFICIAL. 

BOSSES APPEAR AT THE END OF SOME LEVELS, AND EACH HAS A SPECIFIC WEAKNESS YOU NEED TO EXPLOIT.</desc>

YOU ARE AN EXPLORER ON ASSIGNMENT IN A REMOTE CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE. YOU HAVE JUST BEEN REASSIGNED TO FIGHT KROHN SINCE YOUR SHIP, THE MILLENNIUM ORB, IS THE ONLY SPACE CRAFT CABABLE OF WITHSTANDING KROHN'S BLACK HOLE. TO DEFEAT KROHN, YOU MUST GET PAST 30 DIFFERENT CHAMBERS BLOCKING THE PATH. ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE OF EACH CHAMBER ARE FORCE FIELDS WHICH YOU MUST MANEUVER TO KEEP THE MILLENNIUM ORB WITHIN THE CHAMBER. EACH CHAMBER CONTAINS A PLANE IN THE CENTER WITH VARIOUS TARGETS, AROUND WHICH THE ORB WILL TRAVEL. YOU CAN MAKE THE ORB DIVE OUT OF IT'S ORBITAL PATH INTO THE PLANE AND HIT THE TARGETS. TO COMPLETE EACH CHAMBER YOU NEED TO COMPLETE A GOAL WITH THE TARGETS (OFTEN YOU WILL NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CLEAR THEM ALL.) THE MILLENIUM ORB HAS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF FEUL, HOWEVER, WHICH WILL BE USED UP OVER TIME AND IN EVEN GREATER QUANTITIES SHOULD YOU MISS THE ORB WITH THE FORCE FIELDS. WHEN FUEL IS LOW, YOU CAN HEAD TO VERN'S ORB-O-RAMA AND USE EARNED CREDITS TO REFUEL YOUR ORB. 

INCLUDED WITH THE GAME IS A PAIR OF 3-D GLASSES WHICH CAN GIVE THE GAME A MORE 3 DIMENSIONAL APPEARANCE, THOUGH THEY AREN'T REQUIRED FOR GAMEPLAY.</desc>

THE SHIP'S WEAPONS CAN BE FIRED IN TOW DIRECTIONS AND DEFEATED ENEMIES SOMETIMES DROP POWER-UPS THAT EQUIP THE SHIP WITH DIFFERENT WEAPONS AND UP TO TWO OPTIONS. THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT WEAPONS IN ADDITION TO THE STANDARD SHOT: LASER, HOMING MISSILES AND BOMBS.

THE "EDIT MODE" PRESENTS AN UNUSUAL FEATURE. IN IT, PLAYERS CAN DETERMINE THE OPTIONS POSITIONS (WHICH CAN BE CHANGED BY PRESSING THE A AND B BUTTON SIMULTANEOUSLY), AS WELL AS THE PROPERTIES OF THE WEAPONS. IT IS, FOR EXAMPLE, POSSIBLE TO HAVE THE LASER BEHAVE LIKE HOMING MISSILES OR THE HOMING MISSILES LIKE BOMBS.</desc>

		<name>Overlord</name>
		<desc>OVERLORD IS A REAL-TIME STRATEGIC WARFARE GAME WHERE THE PLAYER MUST MANAGE LARGE STANDING ARMIES, ECONOMIC CAPITAL, AND POLITICAL STABILITY THROUGHOUT A NUMBER OF EXTRA-DIMENSIONAL STAR SYSTEMS. 

AS THE DICTATORIAL RULER OF THE EPSILON GALAXY, THE PLAYER HAS OBTAINED COMPLETE, INDISPUTABLE AUTHORITY. HOWEVER, DURING A SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT IN HYPERDRIVE TECHNOLOGY, EPSILON SCIENTISTS DISCOVERED FOUR "BUFFER" DIMENSIONS, EACH CONTAINING A NUMBER OF BARREN PLANETS THAT EXIST BETWEEN THE EPSILON GALAXY AND ANOTHER ALIEN DIMENSION. UNFORTUNATELY, THE MOST POWERFUL EMPIRES FROM THESE ALTERNATE DIMENSIONS HAVE ALSO JUST DISCOVERED THESE ZONES THROUGH THEIR OWN EXPERIMENTS. THE PLAYER MUST BATTLE THESE ALIEN SPECIES FOR CONTROL OF THESE BUFFER WORLDS, TO ENSURE THAT THEIR RULE IN THE EPSILON GALAXY REMAINS INTACT.

TO MAKE THE NEW PLANETS USEFUL IN THE PLAYER'S CAMPAIGN, THEY CAN PURCHASE TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT WHICH CAN TRANSFORM THEM INTO TROPICAL GAIAN-ESQUE WORLDS WHICH ARE IDEAL FOR AGRICULTURE, MINERAL-RICH AND HEAVILY VOLCANIC WORLDS, DESERT PLANETS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING VAST AMOUNTS OF ENERGY, OR ECOLOGICALLY BALANCED PLANETS THAT CAN SUPPORT LARGE CITIES WHICH ARE READILY ABLE TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT INCOME THROUGH TAXATION. IN ADDITION, THE PLAYER CAN MINE FOR RESOURCES AND TAX THEIR CITIZENS TO RAISE MONEY, CONSTRUCT SPACESHIP-BUILDINGS TO FEED THE POPULACE, ENLIST SOLDIERS AND EQUIP THEM, BUY BATTLE CRUISERS OR OTHER CRAFT TO MOVE FROM PLANET TO PLANET, AND SO ON. THE PLAYER CAN FIGHT BATTLES, COLONIZE PLANETS, AND EVEN SPY ON ALIEN RACES. THE END GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT THE OTHER ALIEN RACES DO NOT GAIN THE UPPER HAND BY CONQUERING THESE FOUR NEW DIMENSIONS BEFORE THE PLAYER CAN.

THE PLAYER CANNOT RETREAT FROM BATTLE, AS THE ONLY WAY TO SHUT DOWN THE HYPERSPACE LINK FROM THEIR UNIVERSE TO EPSILON WOULD BE BY VAPORIZING THE PLAYER'S HOMEWORLD, WHICH IS WHERE THE HYPERSPACE GENERATOR IS LOCATED. POLITICALLY (AT THE VERY LEAST), THIS IS NOT AN OPTION.

BLOOD WILL HAVE TO BE SHED FOR SUPREMACY OF THE HYPERSPACE PLANETS, AND FOR THE PLAYER TO BECOME OVERLORD OF THESE FOUR NEW DIMENSIONS PLUS THEIR OWN.</desc>

TO FIGHT BACK, YOU CAN USE HAND-TO-HAND, AND PICK UP WEAPON POWER-UPS, FOUND ON THE GROUND, IN ROOMS, OR DROPPED BY ENEMIES. THESE WEAPONS INCLUDE A KNIFE, WHICH CAN BE USED TO STAB OR BE THROWN, GUNS AND GRENADES.</desc>

		<desc>ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR AND INFLUENTIAL GAMES OF THE 1980'S, PAC-MAN STARS A LITTLE, YELLOW DOT-MUNCHER WHO WORKS HIS WAY AROUND TO CLEAR A MAZE OF THE VARIOUS DOTS AND FRUIT WHICH INHABIT THE BOARD.

PAC-MAN'S GOAL IS CONTINUALLY CHALLENGED BY FOUR GHOSTS: THE SHY BLUE GHOST BASHFUL (INKY), THE TRAILING RED GHOST SHADOW (BLINKY), THE FAST PINK GHOST SPEEDY (PINKY), AND THE FORGETFUL ORANGE GHOST POKEY (CLYDE).  ONE TOUCH FROM ANY OF THESE GHOSTS MEANS A LOSS OF LIFE FOR PAC-MAN.

PAC-MAN CAN TURN THE TABLES ON HIS PURSUERS BY EATING OF THE FOUR ENERGIZERS LOCATED WITHIN THE MAZE.  DURING THIS TIME, THE GHOSTS TURN BLUE, AND PAC-MAN CAN EAT THEM FOR BONUS POINTS.  THIS ONLY LASTS FOR A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME, AS THE GHOST'S EYES FLOAT BACK TO THEIR CENTER BOX, AND REGENERATE TO CHASE AFTER PAC-MAN AGAIN.

SURVIVE A FEW ROUNDS OF GAMEPLAY, AND BE TREATED TO HUMOROUS INTERMISSIONS BETWEEN PAC-MAN AND THE GHOSTS.</desc>

THE NINE LEVELS ARE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD SIDE-SCROLLING PLATFORM STAGES, WITH A NICE TWIST IN LEVEL 5, 7 AND 8.1 (A HELICOPTER, UNDERWATER AND MOON SURFACE LEVEL RESPECTIVELY). WHILE PLAYING, YOU CAN VIEW A STATUS REPORT WITH THE REMAINING BUGS TO BE FOUND.

		<name>Pictionary : The Game of Video Quick Draw</name>
		<desc>BASED ON THE BOARD GAME, THE OBJECT IS TO GUESS EITHER A WORD OR PHRASE BASED ON A DRAWING. EACH TEAM STARTS ON THE SAME SQUARE ON THE BOARD AND THE FIRST TEAM ATTEMPTS TO DRAW A PICTURE BASED ON A CLUE.  IF HIS TEAM CORRECTLY GUESSES THE CLUE, THEN THIS TEAM GETS TO ROLL THE DICE AND ADVANCE ALONG THE BOARD.  IF THE TEAM FAILS TO GUESS CORRECTLY, THEN THE OTHER TEAM GETS A CHANCE TO DRAW AND GUESS. THE GAME PLAYS MUCH IN THIS WAY UNTIL A TEAM REACHES THE FINAL SQUARE ON THE BOARD AND SUCCESSFULLY GUESSES THE CLUE TO WIN THE GAME.

THIS GAME CONTAINS THREE DIFFERENT MODES; REGULAR GAME, ALTERNATIVE GAME, AND DRAWING PRACTICE. IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR UP TO FOUR TEAMS WHICH CAN BE MADE COMPRISING OF ANY NUMBER OF PLAYERS PER EACH TEAM. 

IN THE REGULAR GAME, A TEAM WILL BE GIVEN A TURN TO START REVEALING PIECES OF ONE OF THE 500+ DRAWINGS THAT ARE HIDDEN IN THE GAME. EACH DRAWING IS A 6X8 SIZE AND HAS 48 PIECES TO IT. TO REVEAL THE PIECES, THE PLAYER IS MADE TO PLAY ONE OF FOUR TIMED MINIGAMES WHICH ARE CHOSEN DEPENDING ON THE COLOR OF THE SQUARE THE PLAYER LANDED ON THE BOARD. THE MINIGAMES CONSIST OF ATTACK OF THE PAINT ZOMBIES, THE WAREHOUSE SHUFFLE, LEAPIN' ENERGY CAPSULES!, AND FOUR ALARM RESCUE. IN ATTACK OF THE PAINT ZOMBIES THE PLAYER FIRES DOWNWARDS AT THE ALIENS AND THE MORE ALIENS THAT ARE HIT THE MORE PIECES THAT ARE REVEALED OF THE DRAWING. IF THE ALIENS HIT THE PLAYER, THE PLAYER LOSES TIME OFF THE CLOCK. IN THE WAREHOUSE SHUFFLE, THE PLAYER GOES ALL THE WAY TO THE LEFT SIDE AND THEN STACKS AS MANY BOXES ON TOP OF EACH OTHER THAT THEY CAN BRING OVER ALL THE WAY TO THE RIGHT SIDE. WHILE TRANSPORTING THE BOXES, THEIR ARE TWO ENEMIES WHO CAN HIT INTO YOUR BOXES THUS SUBTRACTING THEM FROM THE HAUL AND ALSO TAKING TIME AWAY. EACH BOX BROUGHT OVER REDUCES A PIECE OF THE HIDDEN DRAWING. IN  LEAPIN' ENERGY CAPSULES!, THE PLAYER IS AN ASTRONAUT AND IS MOVING AND JUMPING TO COLLECT BLUE SPHERES. WHILE COLLECTING THE SPHERES THE PLAYER MUST TRY TO AVOID HITTING ANY ENEMIES WHICH WILL REDUCE TIME. EACH SPHERE COLLECTED CLEARS UP ANOTHER PIECE OF THE DRAWING. IN FOUR ALARM RESCUE, THE PLAYER CONTROLS A PAIR OF FIREMEN ON THE GROUND WITH A NET WHO ARE MOVING BACK AND FORTH CATCHING THE JUMPING PEOPLE ABOVE ON THE NET. EACH PERSON RESCUED LEADS A REVEALED PIECE OF THE DRAWING WHILE EACH PERSON NOT RESCUED LEADS TO REDUCED TIME.

THE ALTERNATIVE GAME ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO DRAW THE PICTURE FOR OTHER PLAYERS TO GUESS, SO THEIR ARE NO MINIGAMES IN THIS MODE. OTHER THAN THAT, IT IS THE SAME AS THE REGULAR MODE.

DRAWING PRACTICE LETS THE PLAYER PRACTICE THEIR DRAWING TECHNIQUE WITHOUT THE PRESSURE OF A TIMER.</desc>

		<name>Pipe Dream</name>
		<desc>EACH LEVEL OF THIS ABSTRACT PUZZLER CHALLENGES THE PLAYER TO SET UP A NETWORK OF PIPES TO ALLOW AN UNSPECIFIED SUBSTANCE KNOWN AS 'FLOOZ' TO FLOW THROUGH AS MANY OF THOSE AS POSSIBLE. THE PIECES ARE OFFERED IN RANDOM ORDER, AND THERE ARE SEVEN DIFFERENT TYPES - STRAIGHT LINES GOING HORIZONTALLY OR VERTICALLY, CORNERS ROTATING IN EACH OF THE FOUR DIRECTIONS, AND CROSS-OVER PIECES WHICH CARRY THE FLOOZ STRAIGHT ACROSS HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY. EACH OF THESE CAN BE ENTERED FROM EITHER SIDE. WHEN THE FLOOZ HITS A GAP, OR A PIECE WHICH THE PREVIOUS PIECE CAN'T FLOW INTO, THE PIPE IS FINISHED.

BEFORE THE FLOOZ STARTS FLOWING FROM ITS RANDOMLY-SELECTED STARTING POSITION, THE PLAYER HAS SEVERAL SECONDS TO START PLACING PIECES. THEY CAN BE PUT DOWN ANYWHERE. HOWEVER A SITUATION THAT CAN OFTEN OCCUR IS THERE WILL BE A LONG AND COMPLEX PIPING ARRANGEMENT SET UP, YET A GAP SOMEWHERE REMAINS TO BE FILLED. PLAYERS ARE ABLE TO  REPLACE A PIECE WITH ANOTHER IN THE SAME SQUARE (TO MAKE IT EASIER TO FLOW THE FLOOZ THAT WAY), BUT FOR A SLIGHT SCORING PENALTY.

BONUSES ARE AWARDED FOR LOOPING THE FLOOZ THROUGH BOTH SIDES OF AT LEAST 5 CROSS-OVER PIECES, OR PASSING THE FLOOZ THROUGH EVERY SQUARE ON THE SCREEN. LATER LEVELS HAVE SOME SQUARES ON THE GRID BLOCKED OFF, A FEW GAPS IN THE SIDE-WALL (ALLOWING FLOOZ TO THREAD TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN). AFTER EVERY FOUR LEVELS THERE IS A BONUS GAME FOR POINTS, IN WHICH THE PLAYER CAN ONLY PLACE THE PIECES IN THE LOWEST OPEN SPACE IN EACH COLUMN, SIMILARLY TO THE BOARD GAME OF "CONNECT 4".</desc>

		<desc>THE FILM PLATOON FEATURED A SQUAD OF FIVE SOLDIERS ON THEIR MISSION FOR THE US ARMY IN VIETNAM. IN THIS ACTION GAME BASED AROUND THE FILM, YOU TAKE CONTROL OF THESE FIVE GUYS IN TURN, WITH THE CHANCE TO SWITCH BETWEEN THEM AS THEY EACH TAKE ONE OF THE 3 HITS THAT WOULD KILL THEM.

THE GAME RECREATES EACH OF THE SECTIONS OF THE FILM, STARTING WITH A SIDE-SCROLLING JOURNEY THROUGH THE JUNGLE, WITH PATHS TO CROSS BOTH HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY, AND THE ABILITY TO JUMP OR DUCK HAZARDS. YOU WILL NEED TO BLOW UP A BRIDGE AND THEN LOCATE A VILLAGE, WHICH CONTAINS A TORCH, A MAP AND A TRAP-DOOR. THE ENEMY HAS BOOBY-TRAPPED THE AREA AND ARE LAUNCHING AIRSTRIKES, SO THE DANGER IS NOT ALL FROM ENEMY GROUND SOLDIERS.

THE NEXT SECTION IS IN FIRST-PERSON 3D, AS YOU MOVE THROUGH A NETWORK OF TUNNELS IN SEARCH OF FLARES AND A COMPASS. THERE ARE 3 DISTINCT CONTROL METHODS, CHANGING FROM THE STANDARD MOTION WHEN AN ENEMY APPEARS (THIS PUTS YOU IN CONTROL OF A CROSS-HAIR FOR MORE ACCURATE TARGETING), AND WHEN YOU ENTER A ROOM TO SEARCH.

AFTER ESCAPING THIS YOU SETTLE IN A BUNKER OVERNIGHT, AND HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF FLARES WITH WHICH TO LOCATE INCOMING ENEMY, AND MUST THEN SHOOT THEM BEFORE THEY CAN SHOOT YOU. THE JUNGLE AIRSTRIKE FROM THE FILM IS THE NEXT MOMENT - YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES TO RUSH INTO A SAFE POSITION TO THE NORTH, USING YOUR COMPASS FOR GUIDANCE.

FINALLY YOU FACE THE TREACHEROUS SERGEANT BARNES, AND MUST HIT HIM WITH GRENADES 5 TIMES WHILST TRAPPED IN A FOXHOLE TO PREVENT HIM WIPING YOU OUT.</desc>

THE DELTA FOUNDATION HAS JUST FINISHED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CYBORG UNIT WHICH REPRESENTS A NEW GENERATION OF FIGHTING ROBOTS. THEY WANT TO SELL IT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AS IT WOULD POSE A THREAT TO THE SECURITY OF THE NATION IF IT IS SOLD TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY. THEY HAVE ASKED THE PRESIDENT, WHO IS ACTUALLY AN ALIEN FROM OUTER SPACE, TO CONSIDER THEIR OFFER AND RESPOND IN ONE WEEK. THE GOVERNMENT TAKES THIS MATTER VERY SERIOUSLY, AND ASSIGNS NOVA TO DESTROY THE DELTA FOUNDATION. UNFORTUNATELY, THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE INVOLVED IN THE EVENT THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN TO HIM.

POWER BLADE 2 HAS SIX STAGES WHICH INVOLVES YOU RUNNING THROUGH THE LEVEL, WHILE KILLING OFF ENEMIES AND AVOIDING HAZARDS. AT THE START, YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH STAGE TO START AT, BUT UNLIKE POWER BLADE, ONCE YOU HAVE CHOSEN A STAGE, YOU CAN'T EXIT AND CHOOSE ANOTHER ONE UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE CURRENT ONE FIRST. NEARLY EACH STAGE INVOLVES YOU USING YOUR WITS, AS YOU DODGE SPIKES, JUMPING TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE SCREEN TO AVOID FIRE, AND GETTING FANS TO LIFT YOU ONTO PLATFORMS. YOU CAN ALSO SLIDE YOUR WAY THROUGH TIGHT SPOTS, AS LONG AS YOU SLIDE IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

AT THE END OF EACH STAGE, YOU FIGHT A DIFFERENT BOSS. HOWEVER, IN THE END, YOU MUST FIGHT ALL THE BOSSES YOU FOUGHT BEFORE BEFORE YOU GET TO FIGHT THE ALIEN LEADER.</desc>

SECRET AGENT NOVA IS CALLED IN TO LOCATE AGENTS LOCATED IN SIX SECTORS. THESE AGENTS HOLD AN ID CARD WHICH NOVA MUST ACQUIRE TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE SECURITY ROOM WITHIN EACH SECTOR.

OCCASIONALLY, YOU CAN GET A SPECIAL POWER-UP WHICH TRANSFORMS YOU INTO A MECH, WHICH HAS A SPECIAL ATTACK MODE AND AN THREE UNITS OF ENERGY.

YOU MUST GET THROUGH EACH SECTOR BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT. YOU CAN LEAVE A SECTOR WITHOUT GETTING THE ID CARD AND GO TO ANOTHER SECTOR, AND COME BACK WHEN YOU'RE READY.

		<desc>ONE DAY, THE PEACEFUL NATION OF THE LEXTORIANS DISCOVERS THE PLANET P'RADIKUS, WHERE NUMEROUS UNCIVILIZED TRIBES ARE CONSTANTLY AT WAR WITH ONE ANOTHER. WHEN THEY STEAL A SPACESHIP AND START TO EXPAND THEIR WARS ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEMS, YOU ARE TRAINED BY THE ELDERS TO HALT THEIR DOMINANCE AND DESTROY THE HOME PLANET WITH A SECRET WEAPON KNOWN AS "THUNDERBOLT".

USING THE TYPICAL THRUST MOVEMENT FROM THE ASTEROIDS GAMES, YOU ROAM SPACE WITH YOUR STARSHIP TO RETURN THE PEACE BY FORCE. STARTING AS A ROOKIE, MANY ENEMY SHIPS NEED TO BE DESTROYED TO EARN CREDITS THAT CAN BE EXCHANGED FOR FUEL, ARMOR, WEAPONS, SHIELDS AND WARP DRIVES. THE COMMANDER INSTRUCTS YOU WITH SPECIFIC MISSIONS, SUCH AS DESTROYING OUTPOSTS OR FREEING ALIEN GROUPS. HOWEVER, YOUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO FIND THE TOSON DRIVE, THE ONLY DEVICE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO REACH P'RADIKUS. TO SPICE THINGS UP, THERE ARE MANY WEAPONS SUCH AS SHOCK WAVES, MINES, MISSILES, CLOAKING DEVICES AND ATOMIC CANNONS. AS YOUR FUEL CONSTANTLY DEPLETES, YOU OFTEN NEED TO ORBIT NEW PLANETS TO REFUEL AND STOCK WEAPONS.</desc>

		<name>Puzznic</name>
		<desc>THE CHALLENGE IN EACH LEVEL OF PUZZNIC IS TO MANEUVRE A SELECTION OF BLOCKS INTO PLACE SO AS TO CLEAR THEM ALL, BY MAKING THEM MAKE CONTACT WITH BLOCKS OF THE SAME DESIGN. YOU CONTROL A CROSS-HAIR, WHICH CAN MOVE A BLOCK LEFT OR RIGHT, WHICH CAN CAUSE IT TO FALL IF THERE IS NO BLOCK UNDER THE SPACE IT WOULD OCCUPY.

THERE ARE MANY COMPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF SOLVING THE LEVELS. MOVING PLATFORMS MEANING THAT YOU NEED TO MOVE A BLOCK AT A PARTICULAR TIME, OR IN PARTICULAR ORDER, TO PREVENT THEM BEING BLOCKADED. IN SOME SITUATIONS THERE ARE AN ODD NUMBER OF A CERTAIN TYPE OF BLOCK - SOLVING THESE REQUIRES POSITIONING TWO OF THE BLOCKS ONE SPACE APART, SUCH THAT A MOVE WILL RESULT IN A PIECE MAKING CONTACT WITH 2 OTHERS, AND IMMEDIATELY REMOVING ALL 3. YOU WILL ALSO ENCOUNTER BLOCKS POSITIONED ON PLATFORMS SUSPENDED IN SPACE AND GAPS IN LEVEL ARRANGEMENTS MEANING THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BLOCKS MUST BE IN PLACE TO MAKE A CERTAIN MOVE POSSIBLE (BY FORMING A STACK, FOR EXAMPLE)

THE GAME STRUCTURE IS SLIGHTLY UNUSUAL, AS AFTER YOU COMPLETE EACH BATCH OF FOUR LEVELS YOU GET A CHOICE OF 2 SETS OF LEVELS - YOU ARE PROGRESSING THROUGH AN EXPANDING MATRIX OF LEVELS, WHICH MEANS THERE ARE 2 SETS ON LEVEL 2, 3 ON LEVEL 3, 4 ON LEVEL 4, AND SO ON. THIS MEANS THAT THERE ARE A TOTAL OF 220 SCREENS IN THE GAME. EACH SCREEN IS PLAYED AGAINST A TIME LIMIT, AND LOSING A LEVEL (EITHER BY RUNNING OUT OF TIME, OR BY MAKING A POOR MOVE AND LEAVING AN IMPOSSIBLE POSITION) LOSES ONE OF YOUR 3 LIVES.</desc>

1. C.J.'S ELEPHANT ANTICS: C.J. THE ELEPHANT WENT AND GOT HIMSELF CAUGHT IN AN ELEPHANT TRAP. ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, HE'S IN A PARISIAN ZOO. HE MAKES A BREAK FOR IT AND VOWS TO MAKE HIS WAY BACK HOME TO AFRICA, TRAVELING THROUGH PARIS, SWITZERLAND, AND EGYPT IN ORDER TO REACH HIS DESTINATION. THIS GAME IS A SIDE-SCROLLING ACTION GAME.

3. F-16 RENEGADE: YOUR CRAZY PROFESSOR HAS HACKED INTO THE US AIR FORCE'S COMPUTERS AND PROGRAMMED ALL OF THE JETS TO FLY OFF AND START WORLD WAR III. SINCE NO ONE WILL BELIEVE YOUR TALE ON THIS MATTER, YOU TAKE IT UPON YOURSELF TO FOLLOW YOUR PROFESSOR'S FOOTSTEPS: YOU HACK INTO THE USAF COMPUTERS YOURSELF BUT TO LOCATE THE F-16 TRAINING PROGRAM SO THAT YOU CAN THEN BREAK INTO THE AIR BASE AND HEIST A JET IN ORDER TO TAKE DOWN ALL OF THE MALEVOLENT COMPUTER-CONTROLLED JETS. THE ACTION IN THIS GAME CONSISTS OF FLYING A JET AND SHOOTING OTHER JETS. HOWEVER, THE PERSPECTIVE ALTERNATES FROM OVERHEAD SCROLLING (ODD LEVELS) TO 3RD PERSON VIEW FROM BEHIND THE JET (EVEN LEVELS). POWERUPS COME IN THE FORM OF STRONGER WEAPONS, SMART BOMBS, AND EXTRA LIVES. THE GAME ALSO FEATURES A 2-PLAYER COMPETITIVE MODE.

		<desc>RACE AMERICA IS A 2-CAR CROSS-COUNTRY RACING GAME. EITHER 2 PLAYERS CAN COMPETE ON THE SAME SCREEN, OR THE COMPUTER CAN CONTROL THE SECOND PLAYER. THE GAME PROVIDES EIGHT COLORFUL OPPONENTS TO RACE AGAINST, EACH OF WHOM IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE DISTINCT ADVANTAGES IN A RACE. EACH RACE BEGINS FROM A SIDE-SCROLLING PERSPECTIVE AS THE 2 COMPETITORS SPEED OUT OF THE GATE. AFTER A CERTAIN DISTANCE, THE PERSPECTIVE SHIFTS TO THIRD PERSON AND THE DRIVER IN THE LEAD OCCUPIES THE TOP HALF OF THE SCREEN WHILE THE DRIVER IN SECOND IS RELEGATED TO HALF OF THE LOWER SCREEN. OCCASIONALLY, THE GAME ALSO EMPLOYS AN OVERHEAD VIEW. TO ADD TO THE CHALLENGE, THE GAME'S CARS HAVE 6-SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS WHICH PLAYERS MUST SHIFT USING THE CONTROL PAD, BUT NOT WHILE PRESSING THE GAS BUTTON.</desc>

		<desc>TAKING A RATHER LITERAL VIEW OF THE TERM 'SLAP-STICK HUMOUR', RODLAND FEATURES TWO FAIRIES CALLED TAM AND RIT, WHOSE MISSION IS TO RESCUE THEIR MUM WHO'S BEEN CAPTURED AND TAKEN TO A CASTLE. 

THERE ARE 40 SCREENS TO CLEAR, ALL FULL OF BADDIES, WHO ARE DISPOSED OF BY GRABBING THEM WITH A STICK, AND FLIPPING THEM FROM SIDE TO SIDE TO INFLICT DAMAGE. THE HITS NEEDN'T ALL BE INFLICTED AT THE SAME TIME, AS IT'S POSSIBLE TO RELEASE THEM TO MOVE THEM OUT OF THE WAY.

WHEN KILLED, EACH BAD GUY RELEASES SOME KIND OF EXTRA, RANGING FROM POINTS BONUSES TO VARIOUS DEVICES WHICH CAN BE USED TO KILL OTHER ENEMIES.

EACH LEVEL ALSO CONTAINS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FRUIT. IF YOU CAN COLLECT ALL OF THIS (WITH SOME BAD GUYS STILL ALIVE - YOU MOVE ON IMMEDIATELY ONCE THEY'RE GONE) YOU ENTER A BONUS GAME, IN WHICH EACH ENEMY'S DEATH RESULTS IN ONE OF THE LETTERS E,X,T,R AND A BEING RELEASED - COLLECT THEM ALL FOR AN INVALUABLE EXTRA LIFE.

IN THE GAME BOY VERSION THE DIFFICULTY LIES SLIGHTLY LOWER BECAUSE THE PLAYER CAN USE HIS WAND EVEN WHEN CLIMBING LADDERS.</desc>

WHILE THE GAME DOES NOT COME WITH THE LICENSE OF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL OR THE MLBPA, THERE ARE STILL 26 SIMILAR TEAMS WITH ROSTERS RESEMBLING THOSE OF THEIR ACTUAL MLB COUNTERPARTS, INCLUDING 1991 STATISTICS. THOUGH PLAYER NAMES COULD NOT BE USED, THE FICTIONAL ONES MAKE IT APPARENT WHO EACH PLAYER REPRESENTS. FOR INSTANCE, YOU CAN STRIKE OUT ONE OF OAKLAND'S BASH BROTHERS (M. BASH OR J. BASH) WITH TEXAS' R. NOLAN OR HIT A HOME RUN WITH DETROIT'S C. FIELDMAN OFF OF CHICAGO'S M. GADDOX. 

THE GAMEPLAY OF ROGER CLEMENS DIFFERS FROM THAT OF MOST NES BASEBALL GAMES. THOUGH THE BATTING SCENES MAY RESEMBLE THOSE TYPIFIED BY R.B.I. BASEBALL AND MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL, THE VIEW SWITCHES TO WHAT ONE MIGHT SEE FROM THE OUTFIELD STANDS ONCE THE BALL IS HIT. THIS RESULTS IN DIFFERENT CONTROLS FROM MOST BASEBALL GAMES AS WELL.

A PLAYER CAN CHALLENGE A FRIEND OR THE COMPUTER, AND ONE-PLAYER GAMES MAY BE EXHIBITION OR PART OF A 33-GAME SEASON, COMPLETE WITH PLAYOFFS ONCE THE SEASON IS COMPLETE. IN ORDER TO HELP MAKE YOUR SEASON A SUCCESSFUL ONE, ROGER CLEMENS HIMSELF IS THERE TO OFFER ADVICE.</desc>

IT INCLUDES A SILLY STORY ABOUT THREE DIFFERENT ROLLER SKATES GANGS (SOMEWHAT LIKE MOTOR CYCLE GANGS) IN A CLOSE FUTURE, WHICH IS MOST AN EXCUSE FOR THE GAME TO EXIST.

YOU CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN THREE DIFFERENT GANGS, ONE IS ALL-AROUND, ONE IS FAST AND WEAK (AND CONSISTS OF WOMEN) AND ONE IS SLOW AND STRONG, YOU GET THE FASHION. THIS ADDS SOME REPLAYABILITY, BUT IN REALITY, THEY ARE KIND OF THE SAME.

THE GAME ALSO SUFFERS FROM TRIAL AND ERROR; YOU MUST LEARN THE COURSES IF YOU WANT TO MASTER THEM. LUCKILY, THE GAME HAS UNLIMITED CONTINUES.</desc>

		<desc>IN THE 21ST CENTURY, THE EVIL EMPEROR GARUDA HAS TAKEN OVER THE CITY OF NEW YORK, KILLING MANY OF ITS INHABITANTS. YOU PLAY AS EITHER HAYATE OR KAEDE, TWO NINJAS WHO ARE ATTEMPTING TO FREE THE CITY FROM GARUDA'S CONTROL.

SHADOW OF THE NINJA IS A TYPICAL SIDE-SCROLLING ACTION GAME, CONSISTING OF RUNNING, SLASHING AND JUMPING THROUGH 5 LEVELS, EACH WITH 4 SUB-STAGES WITH NUMEROUS AND VARIED FOES, AND A BOSS ENEMY AT THEIR END.

KAEDE AND HAYATE CAN NOT ONLY JUMP; AS NINJAS, THEY CAN HANG FROM PLATFORMS AND MAKE SWIFT SALTOMORTALS BETWEEN FLOORS. SOMETIMES, CANISTERS CONTAINING POWERUPS CAN BE FOUND. TYPICAL POWERUPS EXTEND RANGE OF THE DEFAULT SWORD, OR THEY MAY BE ADDITIONAL WEAPONS SUCH AS THROWING STARS AND A NINJA WEAPON THAT LOOKS LIKE A BIG GRAPPLING HOOK ON A STRING.

THE GAME ALLOWED TWO PLAYERS TO PLAY COOPERATIVELY, A RARE FEATURE FOR ACTION GAMES OUTSIDE OF THE CONTRA SERIES.</desc>

		<name>Shadowgate</name>
		<desc>USING THE SAME GRAPHICAL INTERFACE AS DEJA VU, SHADOWGATE IS AN ADVENTURE GAME SET IN A FANTASY WORLD. PLAYERS TAKE THE PART OF AN ADVENTURER SENT TO THE ANCIENT KEEP OF SHADOWGATE ON A QUEST TO FIND A MYSTIC ARTIFACT KNOWN AS THE STAFF OF AGES AND STOP THE EVIL WARLOCK LORD FROM SUMMONING A HORRIFIC DEMON KNOWN AS THE BEHEMOTH. HOWEVER SHADOWGATE HAS BECOME INFESTED WITH THE WARLOCK LORD'S DEMONIC MINIONS, NOT TO MENTION THE CASTLE'S STILL FUNCTIONAL BOOBY-TRAPS.

UNLIKE DEJA VU, DEATH COMES AT YOU SUDDENLY, UNEXPECTEDLY, AND MOST OF ALL OFTEN. SUCH SIMPLE ACTS AS PULLING THE WRONG SWITCH OR OPENING THE WRONG DOOR CAN CAUSE YOU TO BE SKEWERED BY A BOOBY-TRAP OR DISEMBOWELED BY A MONSTER. IT'S ALLSO WORTH MENTIONING THE FACT THAT IF YOUR TORCH BURNS OUT (THIS HAPPENS QUITE REGULARLY) AND YOU FORGET TO LIGHT A NEW ONE, YOU'LL TRIP IN THE DARK AND BREAK YOUR NECK.

A WINDOWS 3.X UPDATE TO THIS GAME WAS CREATED IN 1991.</desc>

YOU ARE ARMED ONLY WITH A SPACESUIT AND A SHOCKWAVE PISTOL. TO RETRIEVE THE CRYSTALS, YOU WILL NEED TO FIND YOUR WAY THROUGH NUMEROUS MAZES. BLOCKS IN THE MAZE CAN BE MOVED WITH THE SHOCKWAVE PISTOL. WHEN YOU HIT A BLOCK WITH THE PISTOL, THIS WILL MOVE BLOCKS ADJACENT TO THE BLOCK HIT RATHER THAN THE BLOCK ITSELF. IF NUMEROUS BLOCKS ARE LINED UP, THE SHOCKWAVE WILL CONTINUE TO TRAVEL THROUGH THE BLOCKS UNTIL THE PATH IS CLEAR AND A BLOCK CAN BE MOVED. SOME BLOCKS ARE INDESTRUCTABLE AND IMMOVABLE, WHILE OTHERS CAN BE MOVED, AND SOME COMPLETELY DESTROYED. TELEPORTATION DOORS, FORCE FIELDS AND OTHER SPECIAL ITEMS CAN BE FOUND IN SOME MAZES. TO COMPLETE MOST OF THE LEVELS THE BLOCKS WILL NEED TO BE MOVED ABOUT IN THE PROPER ORDER TO AVOID LEAVING A CRITICAL PATH PERMANENTLY BLOCKED. IF YOU DO GET STUCK, THERE IS AN OPTION TO RESTART A MAZE (THIS FEATURE BECOMES MORE AND MORE USEFUL AS THE GAME PROGRESSES.) WANDERING ABOUT MANY OF THE LEVELS ARE FIRESTARS WHICH WILL WEAKEN YOUR SPACESUIT AND EVENTUALLY DESTROY IT. EACH LEVEL HAS A TIME LIMIT IN WHICH TO SOLVE THE MAZE AND RETRIEVE ALL OF THE CRYSTALS.</desc>

PLAYER 1 WOULD PLAY AS A HELICOPTER, BUT IF A SECOND PLAYER JOINED THE GAME, THEY WOULD PLAY AS A JEEP. BOTH PLAYERS WOULD HAVE TO PROTECT EACH OTHER AS WELL AS THEMSELVES. AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF KILLS, A "GOOSE" HELICOPTER WOULD FORM ON THE SCREEN. IF THE PLAYERS MANAGED TO DESTROY IT THEY WOULD GET A WEAPONS POWERUP.

SILVER SURFER LEARNS THAT CREATURES FROM THE MAGICK DIMENSION ARE TRYING TO BREAK THROUGH INTO THE UNIVERSE AND THEIR COMING WILL END ALL LIFE. VOWING TO STOP THEM, SILVER SURFER MUST ASSEMBLE THE PIECES OF A MYSTERIOUS COSMIC DEVICE AND USE IT TO PUSH THEM BACK. THE PIECES OF THE DEVICE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE HANDS OF SOME MALICIOUS CREATURES: REPTYL, MEPHISTO, SKRULL EMPEROR, POSSESSOR AND FIRELORD. SILVER SURFER MUST TRAVEL TO THEIR DOMAINS AND DEFEAT THEM IN ORDER TO OBTAIN PIECES OF THE DEVICE.

SILVER SURFER IS A SHOOTER GAME, WITH SOME LEVELS TAKING PLACE VERTICALLY AND SOME HORIZONTALLY. THE SURFER'S ONLY ABILITY IS TO MOVE AROUND ON THE SCREEN AND TO SHOOT DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HIM. POWER-UPS THAT CAN BE PICKED UP INCLUDE: THE LETTER "F" (FIREPOWER) WHICH WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER AND POWER OF HIS PROJECTILES, SMART BOMBS WHICH DESTROY EVERYTHING ON THE SCREEN, THE LETTER "S" (SPEEDUP) WHICH INCREASES THE SURFER'S MOVEMENT AND ORBS WHICH WILL ALSO FIRE THE SURFER'S WEAPON. ORBS ARE SPECIAL IN THAT TWO CAN BE OBTAINED (ONLY 1 IS SHOWN ON HORIZONTAL SCROLLING LEVELS) AND THEY CAN BE POSITIONED TO FIRE FORWARDS, BACKWARDS OR SIDEWAYS.</desc>

		<desc>SKATE OR DIE INCORPORATES FIVE DISTINCT STYLES OF SKATING, WHICH CAN BE ATTEMPTED INDIVIDUALLY OR IN TURN. YOU SKATE AROUND A MENU ROOM TO CHOOSE WHICH ONE TO ATTEMPT. BEFORE TAKING OFF YOU CAN VISIT RODNEY'S SKATE SHOP TO BUY EQUIPMENT.

THE FIRST EVENT IS FREESTYLE, IN WHICH YOUR AIM IS TO SCORE AS MANY POINTS AS POSSIBLE IN 10 ATTEMPTS. JUDGES DETERMINE HOW MUCH STYLE AND SKILL YOU HAVE SHOWN. THE HIGH JUMP USES THE SAME EQUIPMENT, ONLY THIS TIME YOUR TASK IS TO JUMP AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE AT THE END OF THE RAMP.

THE DOWNHILL EVENTS ARE OVERHEAD-VIEW RACES. IN THE DOWNHILL RACE YOU SIMPLY TRY TO COMPLETE THE COURSE WITHIN 90 SECONDS. IN THE DOWNHILL JAM YOU TRY TO OUTPERFORM A HUMAN OR COMPUTER OPPONENT WHILST DODGING OR JUMPING HAZARDS. YOU CAN USE ATTACKING MOVES TO EITHER REMOVE HAZARDS OR KNOCK YOUR OPPONENT OVER. 

THE POOL JOUST IS MORE OF A ONE-ON-ONE BEAT EM UP USING A STICK, SET WITHIN A PIT TO SKATE AROUND.</desc>

TO HELP OUT, YOU HAVE A MAGIC WAND WHICH CAN BE USED TO CREATE AND DESTROY BLOCKS (THOUGH SOME BLOCKS CAN'T BE DESTROYED). IN ORDER TO REACH THE KEY YOU WILL NEED CAREFULLY TO ARRANGE THE BLOCKS ON THE SCREEN SO YOU CAN JUMP YOUR WAY AROUND SAFELY. WANDERING AROUND EACH LEVEL ARE A VARIETY OF ENEMIES WHICH WILL CAUSE YOU TO LOSE A LIFE IF YOU'RE CAUGHT. SOME CREATURES CAN BE KILLED BY DESTROYING THE BLOCK THEY ARE STANDING ON, OTHERS MUST BE DODGED. HIDDEN BONUSES AND MAGIC CAN BE FOUND ON MANY OF THE LEVELS, SOMETIMES EVEN HIDDEN IN BLOCKS. SOME TREASURES GIVE YOU BONUS POINTS, OTHERS CAN FORM MAGIC SPELLS TO HELP DEAL WITH THE ENEMIES. TO MAKE THE GAME MORE DIFFICULT, EACH LEVEL HAS A TIME LIMIT IN WHICH IT MUST BE COMPLETED.</desc>

		<name>Space Shuttle Project</name>
		<desc>THE LAUNCH DIRECTOR HAS ASSIGNED A COMMANDER TO TAKE CONTROL OF SEVERAL NASA SPACE LAUNCHES TO DO SOME NECESSARY JOBS IN SPACE. IT IS THE COMMANDERS JOB TO DO ALL THE PRE-LAUNCH ACTIVITIES LIKE FUELLING THE SPACE SHIP AND MAKING SURE ALL THE CREW ARE ON SAFELY AND MAKING SURE ALL THE POST-LAUNCH ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED OUT LIKE THE ROCKET AND FUEL TANK SEPARATION AS WELL AS THE SUCCESSFUL LANDING OF THE SHUTTLE. THE COMMANDER IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXTRAVEHICULAR ACTIVITIES IN SPACE SUCH AS LAUNCHING A SATELLITE AND BUILDING A SPACE STATION.

SPACE SHUTTLE PROJECT SIMULATES A SPACE SHUTTLE MISSION FROM PRE-LAUNCH TO LANDING. AFTER WRITING IN A NAME, THE PLAYER IS PRESENTED WITH A MINI GAME THAT REQUIRES THE PLAYER TO MEMORISE NUMBERS AND A SPACE SHUTTLE NAME TO GET PASS SECURITY. AFTER SECURITY THE SPACE SHUTTLE PROJECT IS SPLIT INTO FOUR DIFFERENT STAGES EACH WITH THERE OWN CHALLENGES AS FOLLOWS:

1. STAGE 1 - FUEL AND BOARD SHUTTLE: THIS STAGE REQUIRES THE COMMANDER TO USE THE LIFT TO TURN THE OXYGEN AND HYDROGEN SWITCHES ON AND OPEN THE SHUTTLE DOORS. THEN THE COMMANDER MUST MOVE DOWN AND UP THE LIFT PICKING UP THE CREW NEEDED FOR THE MISSION (INCREASES AS THE LEVELS GET HARDER) WHILE AVOIDING SLIDERS THAT CROSS IN LIFTS PATH. THIS TASK HAS TO BE DONE WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT.

2. STAGE 2 - SPACE SHUTTLE LAUNCH: THIS STAGE REQUIRES THE COMMANDER TO CONTROL THE SPACE SHUTTLE INTO ORBIT WHILE DISCONNECTING THE ROCKET BOASTERS (SRB) AND THE EXTERNAL TANK (ET). ALL THIS IS CONTROLLED BY PLAYING TWO MINI-GAMES THAT REQUIRE THE PLAYER TO ETHER STOP THE POWER BAR AT THE CORRECT POINT OR BY MOVING THE BOTTOM ARROW LEFT AND RIGHT TO MATCH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE TOP ARROW. A THIRD MINI-GAME IS ADDED LATER THAT REQUIRES THE PLAYER TO MEMORIZE THE CORRECT COMBINATION

3. STAGE 3 - EXTRAVEHICULAR ACTIVITIES: THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE COMPETED IN SPACE VARY DEPENDING ON THE MISSION. MISSION 1 REQUIRES THE COMMANDER TO RELEASE A SATELLITE INTO SPACE NAVIGATING IT TO AVOID ALL THE OTHER MOVING SATELLITES THAT ARE LITTERED THOUGH SPACE. MISSIONS 2, 4, AND 6 REQUIRES THE COMMANDER TO BUILD A PART OF A SPACE STATION BY GRABBING A BLOCK FROM THE SHUTTLE AND MOVING IT INTO THE CORRECT PART OF THE SPACE STATION WHILE AVOIDING SATELLITES AND MAKING SURE THE OXYGEN LEVELS DONT RUN OUT. MISSION 3 REQUIRES TO MOVE AND FROM A DAMAGED SATELLITE AVOIDING SPACE ROCKS AND REPAIR IT. MISSION 5 IS LIKE MISSION 3 BUT TO RESCUE A STRANDED SOVIET COSMONAUT.

4. STAGE 4 - REENTER ATMOSPHERE AND LAND:THIS STAGE REQUIRES THE COMMANDER TO CONTROL THE SHIP INTO REENTRY AND LAND THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON A LANDING STRIP. THE MINI-GAMES ARE THE SAME AS THE SPACE SHUTTLE LAUNCH EXPECT THE D-PAD IS USED FOR STOPPING THE POWER BAR.

THERE ARE 6 DIFFERENT MISSIONS WITH EACH MISSION A BEING MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE LAST AND ONLY FIVE FAILS ALOUD BEFORE THE WHOLE MISSION FAILS. PASSWORD SAVE IS AVAILABLE BY ADDING THE SUPPLIED PASSWORD NUMBERS AND SPACE SHUTTLE NAME INSTEAD OF THE MEMORIZED NUMBERS AT THE SECURITY CHECK.</desc>

SPIDER-MAN: RETURN OF THE SINISTER SIX IS A SIDE-SCROLLING GAME WHICH PUTS YOU IN THE ROLE OF SPIDEY THROUGHOUT SIX LEVELS AGAINST ELECTRO, SANDMAN, MYSTERIO, VULTURE, HOBGOBLIN AND DOCTOR OCTOPUS RESPECTIVELY.

		<desc>WHEN THE RULERS OF PLANET NEPTUNE FIND THAT THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF THEIR MAIN FOOD SOURCE  MAN-HAM  THEY HIT ON A DEVIOUS PLAN: INVADE THE NEARBY PLANET EARTH AND MELT THE POLAR ICE-CAPS, THUS SINKING ALL CITIES. THEN IMPRISON THE HUMAN CREATURES IN UNDERWATER FACTORIES WHERE THEY CAN BE TURNED INTO A FRESH SOURCE OF MAN-HAM.

THE PLAN GOES PERFECTLY. THE LEADERS OF EARTH'S NATIONS ARE TAKEN COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE AS THE ICE-CAPS MELT AND THE GLOBE IS FLOODED. IT SEEMS THAT HUMANITY WILL MEET ITS END ON THE DINNER PLATES OF THE NEPTUNIAN MONSTERS. BUT WAIT! ONE HOPE REMAINS, IN THE FORM OF EVIL PIRATE NARIKEEN, WHO HAS BEEN THE SCOURGE OF THE WORLD'S NATIONS, PILLAGING AND CAUSING GENERAL DISTRESS IN HIS PINK SUBMARINE, SQOON. THE LEADER OF THE WORLD'S AILING DEFENSE FORCE TURNS TO THIS FORMER PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER 1, AND WITH SOME DIFFICULTY MANAGES TO CONVINCE NARIKEEN TO SAVE THE WORLD.

IN THIS SIDE-SCROLLING SHOOTER, YOU CONTROL NARIKEEN'S SUB, SQOON. SQOON IS EQUIPPED WITH TWO WEAPONS; AN UPGRADABLE MISSILE LAUNCHER WHICH SHOOTS STRAIGHT AHEAD TO TAKE OUT THE WEIRD NEPTUNIAN ENEMIES AND AN ICE-BOMB WHICH SHOOTS HORIZONTALLY DOWNWARDS TO BLOW UP FACTORIES AND OTHER INSTALLATIONS. DESTROYING THESE BUILDINGS RELEASES THE HUMANS INSIDE, WHO THEN FLOAT OUT SO YOU CAN RESCUE THEM. WHEN YOU HAVE NINE PEOPLE ON-BOARD, A SMALL MOBILE ISLAND WILL APPEAR ON THE SURFACE, ALLOWING YOU TO DROP OFF THE HUMANS AND RE-FUEL. YOU'LL NEED TO SAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE AND RE-FUEL REGULARLY, AS YOUR SUB ONLY LASTS ABOUT 60 SECONDS ON ONE TANK OF GAS. THERE ARE EIGHT LEVELS IN THE GAME, EACH SET IN A DIFFERENT (SUNKEN) COUNTRY.</desc>

SUDDENLY, A SPACESHIP CRASHES BEFORE THEM! "LETTUCE CHECK IT OUT," URGES MARU. FROM THE SHIP APPEARS A MAN DRESSED AS A KING. "I YAM KING KALE," HE SAYS, "WON'T YOU PEAS PEAS HELP ME?" YES, THE FLACCID PUNS START TO FLY FROM THIS POINT AND DON'T LET UP UNTIL THE VERY END OF THE GAME. THOSE EXPECTING WITTY DIALOGUE FROM THIS GAME OBVIOUSLY HAVE NEVER SPOKEN TO A GAME PROGRAMMER BEFORE.

IT SEEMS THAT KING KALE NEEDS THE PAIR'S HELP TO PREVENT SIX WORLDS FROM BEING DOMINATED BY A MYSTERIOUS BEING KNOWN AS VEGETRON. EVERY HERO NEEDS A NEMESIS, RIGHT? UNFORTUNATELY, DESPITE MANAGING TO LOOK ALMOST EVIL IN A CUTE WAY, VEGETRON FAILS TO COME ACROSS AS A THREAT TO OUR HEROES. ONE WONDERS HOW HE EVEN MANAGED TO DOMINATE HIS BACK GARDEN, LET ALONE SIX PLANETS, WITH HIS ARMY OF CUTE ROBOTS AND "VEGETABLE-THEMED" GUARDIAN MINIONS, THE LATTER OF WHICH ARE VULNERABLE IN THE SAME SPOTS AND WHICH CAN BE DISPATCHED WITH ALMOST THE SAME PATTERN ON EACH WORLD. THIS IS THE SAME VEGETRON WHO, AFTER A SINGLE DEFEAT AT THE HANDS OF MARU, REALIZES THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS AND CHOOSES TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF IN A PLATITUDINOUS SOLILOQUY WHICH GOES ON AND ON. THAT PUTS AN END TO VEGGIE'S CHANCES OF REAPPEARING IN SEQUELS WITHOUT SOME KIND OF CONTRIVED PLOT TWIST.

OUR TWO HEROES, THEN, SET OFF ON AN ADVENTURE TO SAVE THE KINGS IMPRISONED BY THE BOSS GUARDIANS ON EACH OF THE SIX WORLDS. THIS BEING A PLATFORM GAME, EACH WORLD HAS ITS OWN THEME AND PITFALLS THAT NEED TO BE DEALT WITH. THESE INCLUDE THE ANTI-GRAVITY OF THE SPACE FORTRESS, FIRE PITS OF THE HOT PEPPER PLANET, BLACK HOLES OF THE STAR-SPNGLED [SIC] SQUASH, AND REQUISITE ICY MADNESS OF THE FROZEN VEGETABLE SECTION. THERE IS ALSO A SEVENTH WORLD WHERE THE FINAL BATTLE WITH VEGETRON TAKES PLACE.</desc>

		<name>Star Trek : 25th Anniversary</name>
		<desc>THE SHIP ENTERPRISE IS ON A 5 YEAR MISSION: TO EXPLORE STRANGE NEW WORLDS, TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS, TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE. WHILE THE ENTERPRISE IS INVESTIGATING STRANGE GRAVITATIONAL DISTURBANCES, IT IS DRAWN INTO A DIMENSIONAL HOLE AND ENDS UP IN UNKNOWN SPACE WITH BROKEN WARP ENGINES. NOW, CAPTAIN KIRK AND HIS CREW MUST TRY TO REPAIR THE SHIP AND FIND A WAY HOME.

GAMEPLAY IS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS, TAKING PLACE ON THE SHIP'S BRIDGE AND AWAY MISSIONS. ON THE BRIDGE, YOU CAN COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER SHIPS, CALL UP A MAP TO NAVIGATE THE SHIP (ONCE THE WARP ENGINES ARE FIXED), ENTER BATTLE MODE TO FIGHT OTHER SHIPS (WHICH DOES NOT HAPPEN VERY OFTEN), SAVE THE GAME OR BEAM DOWN TO A PLANET'S SURFACE.
THESE AWAY MISSIONS MAKE UP THE MAJOR PART OF THE GAME AND PLAY VERY MUCH LIKE OTHER ACTION ADVENTURES. YOU CAN TALK TO ALIENS FIND AND USE OBJECTS, SOLVE PUZZLES AND FIGHT AGAINST HOSTILE LIFEFORMS.  BATTLES WITH OTHER SHIPS OR ON AWAY MISSIONS ARE HANDLED IN SIMPLE SHOOT'EM UP-FASHION.</desc>

		<desc>STAR TREK V: THE FINAL FRONTIER WAS A 2D PLATFORM GAME WHICH WAS DEVELOPED BY BANDAI FOR THE NES (NINTENDO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM). IT WAS BASED ON STAR TREK V: THE FINAL FRONTIER BUT WAS CANCELED BEFORE ITS INTENDED RELEASE. THE INCOMPLETE GAME WAS INCONSISTENT WITH MANY PLOT AND CHARACTER ELEMENTS OF THE FINISHED FILM.

IN 2006, A FOUR-STAGE PROTOTYPE VERSION WAS LEAKED ONLINE AS A ROM IMAGE FILE THAT CAN BE PLAYED EITHER THROUGH PC EMULATION OR ON AN ACTUAL NES.

THE FIRST TWO STAGES AND FINAL STAGE WERE IN THE FORM OF A SIDE-TO-SIDE SHOOTER. THE THIRD STAGE ENTAILED SPACE COMBAT IN WHICH THE PLAYER TOOK THE USS ENTERPRISE-A THROUGH AN ASTEROID FIELD AND THEN INTO BATTLE AGAINST A KLINGON CRUISER NEAR THE "CREATION PLANET".</desc>

STAR VOYAGER'S GAMEPLAY REQUIRES THE PLAYER TO VENTURE THROUGH VARIOUS SECTORS OF THE GALAXY IN SEARCH OF DIFFERENT ALIEN FLEETS SO THEY CAN BE DEFEATED. FUEL STATIONS ARE PLACED AROUND SPORADICALLY AND HELP IF FUEL IS RUNNING LOW. THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLANETS THAT ARE EITHER EMPTY OR HAVE PEOPLE THAT CAN UPGRADE THE PLAYER'S EQUIPMENT TO FIGHT OFF THE ENEMY FLEETS. THESE UPGRADES INCLUDE THE SUPER LASER, IMPROVED SHIELDS, AND ENGINES THAT ENHANCE THE SHIP'S WARPING ABILITY. WARPING IS A VITAL PART OF THE GAMEPLAY. IF PLAYERS DO NOT WARP TO DIFFERENT SECTORS WISELY, THEY MIGHT END UP LOST, RUN INTO DANGEROUS SECTORS SUCH AS THE BLACK HOLE OR THE ASTEROID FIELD, OR RUN OUT OF FUEL. THE GAME ENDS IF ENEMY SHIPS DESTROY THE COSMOSTATION NOAH.</desc>

		<name>Stealth ATF</name>
		<desc>STEALTH ATF IS A FLIGHT SIMULATOR IN WHICH YOU PILOT A F-117A, A.K.A. NIGHTHAWK IN SEVERAL MISSIONS.

IN EVERY MISSION'S BEGINNING AND ENDING YOU HAVE TO TAKE OFF AND LAND YOUR PLANE RESPECTIVELY, FROM A SIDE VIEW. IF YOU FAIL TO LAND AFTER COMPLETING THE TARGET OBJECTIVES, YOU FAIL TO SUCCEED IN MISSION AND THUS HAVE TO REPLAY IT.

YOUR VIEW DURING THE FLIGHT IS FROM INSIDE THE COCKPIT, AND THE GAMEPLAY OFFERS TOTAL FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT ON FLIGHT. YOUR TERRAIN IS INFINITE, AND YOUR ENEMIES WILL RE-APPEAR IN YOUR RADAR EVERY TIME THEY FLY OUT OF RANGE. YOU FLY IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, SUCH AS THE MIDDLE EAST, ALASKA, THE PACIFIC, ETC. DURING FLIGHT, YOU CAN ALSO TURN OFF THE MUSIC AND PLAY WITH ONLY THE FLIGHT SOUNDS.

YOUR MISSION IS TO DEFEAT A FIXED NUMBER OF ENEMIES EACH MISSION. YOUR TARGETS WILL ALWAYS BE AERIAL ONES. YOU CAN SHOOT A CANNON (WHICH AMMUNITION IS UNLIMITED) OR MISSILES (8 PER MISSION). IF AN ENEMY SHOOTS YOU A MISSILE, YOU CAN TRY TO AVOID IT USING THE STEALTH MODE (PRESSING THE START BUTTON) ONCE PER MISSION. THE STEALTH MODE WILL AUTOMATICALLY TURN OFF ONCE YOU PASS OUT OF THE DANGER. IF YOU MANAGE TO ACCOMPLISH THE MISSION PERFECTLY, A BONUS ROUND IS OFFERED, AND YOU HAVE TO TRY TO TAKE DOWN AS MANY ENEMIES AS YOU CAN.

THE GAME CAN BE PLAYED BY ONE OR TWO PLAYER TAKING TURNS. A SECOND PLAYER CAN ALSO TAKE CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT CLOSEST TO THE CENTER OF THE RADAR, EITHER IN ONE OR TWO PLAYER MODE.</desc>

THERE ARE ALSO SOME SIDE SCROLLING FLYING LEVELS WHERE YOU CAN SHOOT LASER/HEAT VISION FROM YOUR EYES. THE GAME IS DIVIDED INTO FIVE SCENES WITH ONE-FOUR AREAS WITH A BOSS AT THE END OF EACH AREA.

THE GAME FEATURES A SUPERHERO, NAMED SUNMAN. HE IS VERY REMINISCENT OF SUPERMAN WITH HIS CAPE, AND FLYING ABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE GAMES TITLE SCREEN SEEMS TO MATCH THAT OF THE SUPERMAN LOGO. SUNSOFT'S INVOLVEMENT WITH OTHER DC COMICS CHARACTER LICENSES LEAD SOME TO SPECULATE THAT SUNMAN WAS INTENDED TO BE A SUPERMAN GAME, BUT DC FOR WHATEVER REASON DECIDED NOT TO GO ALONG AND THE GAME HAD SOME CHANGES MADE TO LOSE THE LIKENESS. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH PLANNER/DIRECTOR KENJI ENO, IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THIS WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO BE A SUPERMAN GAME.</desc>

		<name>Tecmo Bowl</name>
		<desc>THE MOST POPULAR AMERICAN FOOTBALL GAME TO HIT THE NES CONSOLE, TECMO BOWL PITS THE PLAYER VS. THE COMPUTER IN 11 GAME SINGLE-ELIMINATION PLAYOFF ACTION, OR YOU CAN GO HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH A HUMAN OPPONENT IN ACTION OR COACH MODE.  THERE ARE 12 TEAMS OF REAL NFL PLAYERS (CIRCA 1988) TO CHOOSE FROM, BUT DON'T LOOK FOR OFFICIAL NFL TEAM LOGOS OR MASCOTS LIKE BEARS OR DOLPHINS--TECMO BOWL HAS THE NFLPA BUT NOT THE NFL LICENSE.

THE PLAY PERSPECTIVE IS TOP-DOWN AND THE SCREEN SCROLLS HORIZONTALLY.  PLAYER GRAPHICS ARE LARGE AND COLORFUL, WHICH IS MADE POSSIBLE BY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS TO NINE PER TEAM.  ANIMATED CUT-SCENES ARE SHOWN FOLLOWING TOUCHDOWNS AND AT HALF-TIME, AND CROWDS ARE SHOWN FILLING THE ENDZONE SEATS.

THERE ARE FOUR PLAYS TO CHOOSE FROM ON OFFENSE--USUALLY TWO RUNS AND TWO PASSES. THE PLAYER TAKES CONTROL OF THE QUARTERBACK BEFORE THE SNAP AND THEN EITHER HANDS OFF TO THE RUNNING BACK OR WORKS THROUGH HIS RECEIVER PROGRESSION FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.  DEFENSE CONSISTS OF TRYING TO GUESS WHICH OFFENSIVE PLAY THE OPPONENT WILL SELECT AND THEN TAKING CONTROL OF ONE OF THE DEFENSIVE PLAYERS BEFORE THE SNAP.  A VERY SIMPLE POWER METER SYSTEM IS USED FOR KICKING FIELD GOALS, EXTRA POINTS, AND PUNTS.

THERE ARE NO GAME OR SEASON STATS AND THERE IS NO WAY TO SAVE YOUR SEASON, BUT THERE IS A PASSWORD FEATURE ALLOWING YOU TO RESUME TOURNAMENT PLAY WHERE YOU LEFT OFF.</desc>

		<desc>[THIS ITEM HAS BEEN SPLIT AND INFORMATION MAY NOT BE COMPLETE ACCURATE. USERS ARE CAUTIONED THAT INCORRECT INFORMATION MAY APPEAR IN THE DESCRIPTION WHICH DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS PLATFORM AND NEEDS TO BE REVISED]

THE GAME FEATURES THE ORIGINAL 4 TURTLES FROM THE PREVIOUS GAMES IN THE SERIES, AS WELL AS OTHER FIGHTERS.

THE GAME IS VERY MUCH IN THE TRADITION OF THE MORTAL KOMBAT OR STREET FIGHTER SERIES, PITTING YOU AGAINST OPPONENTS ONE AT A TIME. SOME FIGHTERS (BESIDES THE TURTLES) WILL BE FAMILIAR, SUCH AS THE CASEY JONES, OR EVEN SHREDDER.

THOUGH EVEN PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE TURTLES WILL SEE DIFFERENCES IN THEM. THEY CAN NOW, FOR EXAMPLE, DO MOVES INVOLVING PROJECTILES, SUCH AS "FIREBALLS".

THE GAME'S MODES INCLUDE A STORY MODE, WHERE YOU CAN ONLY PICK ONE OF THE TURTLES AND GO ON FIGHTING OPPONENTS IN ORDER TO DEFEAT THE SHREDDER, AND A TOURNAMENT MODE, WHERE YOU FIGHT ONLY FOR THE FAME AND MONEY.</desc>

THE FOUR NINJA TURTLES: RAPHAEL, MICHELANGELO, DONATELLO AND LEONARDO FIGHT THEIR WAY THROUGH HORDES OF FOOT SOLDIERS IN ORDER TO RESCUE APRIL. THEY BATTLE FAMILIAR FOES SUCH AS THE MAD SCIENTIST BAXTER STOCKMAN, GENERAL TRAAG FROM DIMENSION X AND THE EVIL ALIEN BRAIN KRANG, UP TO THE FINAL SHOWDOWN WITH SHREDDER HIMSELF.

TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: THE ARCADE GAME IS A PORT OF THE POPULAR ARCADE GAME MADE BY KONAMI DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE CARTOON SERIES' POPULARITY. DEPENDING ON THE VERSION OF THE GAME, UP TO TWO, THREE OR FOUR PLAYERS CAN TAKE PART IN THE ACTION. THE GAME PLAYS LIKE A SIMPLIFIED DOUBLE DRAGON. WHILE MOST OF THE STANDARD FOOT SOLDIER ENEMIES ARE EASILY DISPATCHED, SOME ATTACK WITH KNIVES OR RAY GUNS AND ARE THUS MORE DANGEROUS. AT THE END OF EACH LEVEL, PLAYERS ENCOUNTER A BOSS (OR IN CERTAIN CASES TWO BOSSES WORKING IN TANDEM, SUCH AS BEBOP AND ROCKSTEADY).

THE NES VERSION OF THE GAME FEATURES ADDITIONAL CONTENT NOT PRESENT IN OTHER VERSIONS OF THE GAME: TWO NEW LEVELS (SNOWY CENTRAL PARK AND THE DOJO), NEW BOSSES (INCLUDING TORA, SHOGUN AND BAXTER STOCKMAN AS A FLY), ADDITIONAL MUSIC TRACKS AS WELL AS MORE VARIATIONS OF FOOT SOLDIERS.</desc>

GAMEPLAY TAKES PLACE IN TWO PERSPECTIVES: A TOP-DOWN VIEW, WHICH LETS YOU RUN AROUND AND EXPLORE BUILDINGS, SEWERS AND OTHER PLACES. WHEN ENTERING PLACES FROM THE TOP-DOWN VIEW, THE PERSPECTIVE SHIFTS TO A SIDE-SCROLLING VIEW, WHERE MOST OF THE BATTLING TAKES PLACE. IN ADDITION TO EACH TURTLE'S MAIN WEAPON, SUB-WEAPONS (SUCH AS SHURIKEN) CAN BE ACQUIRED, TO USE AT FOES - THESE HAVE A LIMITED USE.</desc>

		<desc>THIS VERSION OF TETRIS IS ONE OF MANY CONVERSIONS OF THE FAMOUS BLOCK-STACKING GAME, AS WELL AS THE BEST-KNOWN (BUT NOT THE ONLY) VERSION ON NINTENDO'S FIRST HOME CONSOLE. THE GOAL IS TO PLACE PIECES MADE UP OF FOUR TILES IN A TEN-BY-TWENTY WELL, ORGANIZING THEM INTO COMPLETE ROWS, WHICH DISAPPEAR. AS ROWS ARE CLEARED, THE PACE OF THE GAME INCREASES, AND THE GAME ENDS IF THE STACK REACHES THE TOP OF THE WELL.

THE GAME OFFERS TWO DIFFERENT MODES OF PLAY, "TYPE A" AND "TYPE B". "TYPE A" IS A STANDARD ENDLESS MODE, WHERE THE SPEED OF THE GAME INCREASES EVERY TEN LINES, WITH AN OPTION FOR THE STARTING LEVEL WHEN BEGINNING THE GAME. "TYPE B", ON THE OTHER HAND, IS A RACE TO CLEAR 25 LINES, WITH OPTIONS FOR BOTH DROP SPEED AND STARTING GARBAGE. IN BOTH MODES, SUCCESSFUL PLAY IS REWARDED WITH CUTE ANIMATIONS. THERE ARE ALSO THREE DIFFERENT BACKGROUND SONGS TO CHOOSE FROM.</desc>

		<desc>THE DRAMA SURROUNDING TETRIS IS ONE OF THE MOST STORIED SAGAS IN THE HISTORY OF THE NES. TENGEN, AN AMBITIOUS ATARI-ASSOCIATED GAME DEVELOPER, BEGAN RELEASING OFFICIAL NES GAMES IN 1988. MEANWHILE, THE COMPANY WORKED RAPIDLY BEHIND THE SCENES TO OVERRIDE NINTENDO'S INFAMOUS LOCKOUT DEVICE THAT KEPT UNOFFICIAL CARTRIDGES FROM BEING PLAYED ON ITS CONSOLE. WHEN TENGEN RELEASED ITS FIRST UNOFFICIAL GAMES USING ITS NEW TECHNOLOGY, NINTENDO QUICKLY SUED. THIS WAS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE TENGEN/NINTENDO FEUD. IGNORING NINTENDO'S CLAIM TO THE TETRIS NAME IN THE US A YEAR LATER, TENGEN RELEASED ITS OWN VERSION OF THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS PUZZLE GAME ON AN UNLOCKED, UNOFFICIAL CARTRIDGE. TENGEN'S TETRIS WAS PULLED FROM SHELVES ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WHEN IT WAS REVEALED THAT NINTENDO'S HOLD ON THE TETRIS NAME STATESIDE WAS LEGITIMATE. UNFORTUNATELY, ALMOST EVERYONE AGREES THAT TENGEN'S VERSION OF THE GAME WAS FAR SUPERIOR TO NINTENDO'S, EVEN INCLUDING A TWO-PLAYER MODE WHICH NINTENDO'S VERSION SORELY LACKED. TODAY, THE GAME KNOWN AS TENGEN TETRIS IS A RARE TITLE TO HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION, BUT IT'S A WORTHWHILE PLAY. AFTER ALL, TETRIS IS ONE OF THE CLASSIC GAMES NOT ONLY ON THE NES, BUT OF ALL-TIME.</desc>

A JOGABILIDADE SEGUE OS PADRÕES USUAIS DE PLATAFORMAS: PUGSLEY SE MOVE DA ESQUERDA PARA A DIREITA ENQUANTO SALTA E EVITA INIMIGOS.

ESTA VERSÃO DO JOGO É FORTEMENTE BASEADA NA VERSÃO SNES DA THE ADDAMS FAMILY - POSSUI O MESMO ENREDO COM OUTRO PERSONAGEM PRINCIPAL E UM DESIGN DE NÍVEL QUASE IDÊNTICO. OUTRA DIFERENÇA PARA A VERSÃO SNES DESTE JOGO É QUE PUGSLEY SÓ PODE SER ATINGIDO DUAS VEZESS ANTES DE MORRER - MAS HÁ UM POWER-UP ADICIONAL QUE O TORNA MAIS RÁPIDO E DÁ A ELE UMA VIDA EXTRA.</desc>

THE PLAYER CONTROLS A MAGNIFYING GLASS AND MUST CLICK ON VARIOUS ITEMS FOR DIFFERENT EFFECTS. FINDING A CLOCK ADDS MORE TIME TO THE SEARCH, CLICKING ON A 150 ICON ADDS 150 POINTS TO THE SCORE, ETC.

EACH PICTURE CONSISTS OF 6 ADJACENT SCREENS CONTAINING A CONTINUOUS THEME. THE THEMES ARE THE CARPET FLYERS, THE UNDERGROUND HUNTERS, THE BATTLING MONKS, THE UNFRIENDLY GIANTS AND THE LAND OF WALDOS.

		<path>./Immortal, The (USA).zip</path>
		<name>The Immortal</name>
		<desc>THE IMMORTAL IS AN ISOMETRIC ACTION-ADVENTURE GAME.

YOUR OLD MENTOR MORDAMIR HAS DISAPPEARED. PROBABLY KIDNAPPED. YOU'RE NOT TOO SURE WHERE HE MIGHT BE, BUT A DUNGEON IS ALWAYS A GOOD PLACE TO LOOK, SO YOU SEEK OUT THE NEAREST ONE AND PLUNGE INTO ITS DEPTHS. BEWARE: 8 LEVELS OF 
ISOMETRIC DEATH AWAIT.

THE IMMORTAL IS THE PROTOTYPE OF A TRIAL-AND-ERROR GAME. PROGRESS IS MADE BY ENCOUNTERING A HAZARD, DYING, SOLVING THE PROBLEM, ENCOUNTERING THE NEXT HAZARD. TO SOLVE A LEVEL, YOU HAVE TO KNOW ITS TRAPS AND THEIR PATTERNS BY HEART. AS FRUSTRATING AS THIS MAY SOUND (IT IS), THE IMMORTAL QUITE CLEVERLY BALANCES ANNOYANCE WITH CURIOSITY AND GRAPHICAL REWARDS. IN SHORT: YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT CHALLENGE LIES IN THE NEXT ROOM.

THE PUZZLES RANGE FROM SIMPLE AVOIDANCE OF TRAPS TO THE CORRECT USE OF ITEMS; YOU COLLECT OBJECTS IN AN INVENTORY. EVERY NOW AND THEN, THE IMMORTAL SURPRISES WITH A SPECIAL CHALLENGE. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU'VE GOT TO RIDE A MAGIC CARPET THROUGH A HALLWAY FULL OF FIRE TRAPS, OR RIDE A BARREL ON AN UNDERGROUND RIVER. THE DUNGEON ISN'T EMPTY: SOME FRIEDLIES MAY HAVE VALUABLE INFORMATION OR TRADE ITEMS, THE NASTY SORT OF GUYS WILL ATTACK. COMBAT IS FOUGHT MAN-TO-MAN ON A SPECIAL SCREEN. YOUR ADVERSARY INDICATES HIS NEXT ATTACK A FEW SECONDS BEFORE HE EXECUTES IT, SO YOU'VE GOT TIME TO REACT APPROPRIATELY. YOU CAN DODGE TO THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT, AS WELL AS ATTACK FROM THESE TWO DIRECTIONS. THERE IS NO SAVE OPTION IN THE GAME, OF COURSE, BUT YOU MAY RESTART EACH LEVEL AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE. LEVELS CAN BE SKIPPED BY ENTERING PASSWORDS.</desc>

IN THE INCREDIBLE CRASH DUMMIES THE PLAYER ALTERNATES BETWEEN SLICK AND SPIN AS THEY GO THROUGH FIVE LEVELS WITH EACH LEVEL CONTAINING 2 STAGES (EXCEPT FOR THE 4TH LEVEL WHICH ONLY CONSISTS OF ONE). ONE OF THE DUMMIES' LEGS HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH A WHEEL WHILE THE OTHER DUMMY HAS HIS LEGS INTACT.

THE DUMMIES' ARSENAL INCLUDES AN AIR GUN WHICH STUNS ENEMIES AT CLOSE RANGE AND AN OIL GUN WHICH SHOOTS AND KILLS ENEMIES AT A FAR RANGE. THERE ARE ALSO A FEW POWERUPS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE STAGES SUCH AS THE ARROW, BALLOON, AND ARM POWERUP.</desc>

		<desc>ONE DAY, A KIWI TRIBE WAS HAVING FUN AND GAMES OUTSIDE THE ZOO, ONLY TO BE KIDNAPPED BY THE EVIL-MINDED LEOPARD SEAL, WHO PLANS TO SELL THEM AT THE BLACK MARKET. FORTUNATELY, DURING THE KIDNAPPING PROCESS, TIKI, LEADER OF THE TRIBE, MANAGED TO ESCAPE THE SACK, AND HER JOB IS TO RESCUE PHEE-PHEE AND THE OTHER KIWIS SCATTERED AROUND NEW ZEALAND, AND ARE HELD IN CAGES IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS THAT INCLUDE AUCKLAND, ROTORUA, WAITOMO CAVES, STRAIT COOK, AND MT. COOK. 

IF TIKI DOESN'T RESCUE A KIWI IN A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME, THE DEVIL WILL APPEAR AND TRY TO KILL HER. WHEN TIKI REACHES THE OUTSKIRTS OF EACH CITY, EXCEPT STRAIT COOK, THERE IS A BOSS WAITING TO MEET TIKI, AND KILL HER BY USING THEIR OWN CHOICE OF WEAPONS. ALSO MAKING THE RESCUE MISSION DIFFICULT ARE SEVERAL NASTIES THAT ATTEMPT TO THROW THEIR OWN WEAPONS, LIKE BOMBS AND ARROWS, AT HER. TO DEFEAT THESE ENEMIES, TIKI SHOOTS AT THEM USING HER CROSSBOW AND ARROWS. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, WHEN TIKI SHOOTS AT ENEMIES, THEY WILL LEAVE BEHIND PIECES OF FRUIT THAT SHE CAN PICK UP FOR POINTS. HOWEVER, IT IS LIKELY THAT TIKI MAY GET OTHER WEAPONS OR THE LETTERS E, X, T, E, N, AND D. COLLECTING ALL THESE LETTERS WILL RESULT IN AN EXTRA LIFE, AND AS FOR THE WEAPONS, THEY INCLUDE LASER SHOTS, BOMBS, AND FIREBALLS. 

IN SOME LEVELS, A FEW AREAS ARE LOCATED FURTHER UP THAN JUST LEFT OR RIGHT, AND THE ONLY WAY THAT TIKI CAN GO UP IS BY SNATCHING SOMETHING OFF THE ENEMY THAT GIVES HER THE ABILITY TO FLY UP. OTHER AREAS ARE UNDERWATER, AND WHEN TIKI GOES UNDERWATER, HER OXYGEN  METER DECREASES, SO SHE HAS TO RISE UP TO THE SURFACE AGAIN TO RESTORE HER OXYGEN LEVELS. APART FROM HER OWN WEAPONS, TIKI IS ABLE TO SQUIRT WATER AT ENEMIES IF SHE GETS TO THE TOP OF THE WATER.</desc>

		<desc>BART VS. THE SPACE MUTANTS IS A PLATFORM GAME WHERE THE PLAYER GOES INTO THE ROLE OF BART SIMPSON (FROM THE TV SHOW THE SIMPSONS) AND MUST STOP THE SPACE MUTANTS FROM INVADING SPRINGFIELD.

ON EACH OF THE FIVE LEVELS, BART MUST COLLECT (OR GET RID OF) THE INGREDIENTS THAT THE SPACE MUTANTS ARE PLANNING TO USE TO BUILD THEIR MACHINE, SUCH AS PURPLE OBJECTS OR BALLOONS. HE ALSO HAS TO COLLECT ENOUGH "PROOF" OF THE ALIENS EXISTENCE (BROWN COINS LEFT BEHIND WHEN THEY ARE JUMPED ON), SO HIS FAMILY MEMBERS WILL HELP HIM WHEN HE MEETS A BOSS (CHARACTERS SUCH AS NELSON AND SIDESHOW BOB). THIS WON'T BE EASY SINCE THE SPACE MUTANTS ARE "USING" HUMAN BODIES AS DISGUISE. IN ORDER TO DISCOVER WHO ARE THE REAL SPACE MUTANTS, BART MUST USE HIS X-RAY SPECS.

THE WAYS BART CAN GET RID OF THOSE OBJECTS SOUGHT BY THE SPACE MUTANTS ARE NUMEROUS. FOR INSTANCE, IN THE FIRST STAGE, BART MUST GET RID OF PURPLE OBJECTS. HE CAN DYE THEM RED, COVER THEM, WASH THEM, ETC. SOME EVEN INVOLVE A LITTLE PUZZLE SOLVING, LIKE PLAYING A TRICK ON MOE TO MAKE HIM GET OUT OF THE BAR.

BART ALSO HAS SOME COINS THAT CAN BE USED IN MANY WAYS THROUGHOUT THE GAME, LIKE BUYING THINGS, GETTING DEVICES OPERATING, ETC. THOSE COINS ARE ESSENTIAL TO SOLVE SOME PUZZLES IN THE GAME.</desc>

		<desc>DR. EVIL HAS KIDNAPPED THE SCIENTIST JENNY AYKROYD AND IT'S THE ULTIMATE STUNTMAN'S JOB TO RESCUE HER.

ULTIMATE STUNTMAN MUST FIGHT THROUGH 7 WORLDS WITH 4 STAGES EACH AND THEN THROUGH THE FINAL WORLD WHICH CONSISTS OF 3 STAGES. THE GAME HAS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT GAMEPLAY TYPES. THE STAGES GO IN THE ORDER OF AN OVERHEAD VIEW STAGE, A SIDE-SCROLLING STAGE, A CLIMBING STAGE WITH THE ANDROID BOSS, AND THEN A BOMB DISPOSAL STAGE.

THE OVERHEAD VIEW STAGES DEAL WITH YOU DRIVING EITHER A CAR, BOAT, GLIDER, OR A DUNE BUGGY AND TRYING TO GET TO THE END BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT ON THE CLOCK. YOU MUST DO THIS WHILE EITHER DODGING OR SHOOTING ENEMIES. IN ALL THE STAGES BESIDES THE ONE WHERE YOU'RE GIVEN A GLIDER YOU CAN USE A LIMITED NUMBER OF TURBO BOOSTS TO SPEED UP YOUR VEHICLE. IN THE GLIDER STAGES YOU CAN ALTER YOUR ALTITUDE TO EITHER GO HIGH ABOVE OR BELOW VARIOUS OBSTACLES. ALL OF THESE LEVELS END WITH A BOSS BATTLE.

SOMETIMES AFTER THESE STAGES THERE IS A BONUS ROUND WHERE YOU TRY TO COLLECT EXTRAS IN A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME WITHOUT CRASHING INTO ANY OBSTACLES. COMPLETING THIS SUCCESSFULLY WILL YIELD AN EXTRA LIFE.

THE SIDE-SCROLLING STAGES CONSISTS OF TWO DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES. ONE IS A PLATFORMER WHERE YOU WALK AROUND AND CAN SHOOT ENEMIES WHILE SEARCHING FOR A SET NUMBER OF KEYS TO UNLOCK A FORCEFIELD AT THE END OF THE STAGE. THE OTHER CONSISTS OF YOU FLYING A GLIDER THROUGHOUT A STAGE SHOOTING ENEMIES AND TRYING NOT TO CRASH UNTIL YOU GET TO THE END OF THE STAGE.

THE CLIMBING STAGES CONSIST OF YOU CLIMBING A BUILDING AND SHOOTING ENEMIES WITH A RETICLE THAT YOU CAN MOVE ALL OVER THE SCREEN.YOU HAVE TO GET TO THE TOP OF THE BUILDING BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT. ONCE AT THE TOP YOU WILL HAVE TO FIGHT AN ANDROID BOSS. SUCH AS MEGA SLUG, TECHNO BEAST, AND THE SAND YETI. THE ANDROID BOSS FIGHTS TAKE PLACE ON THE BUILDINGS ROOFTOPS WITH A SIDE VIEW OF THE ACTION. THE PLAYER MUST DRAIN THE ENERGY FROM THE ANDROIDS BY REPEATED SHOOTING BULLETS INTO THEM.

IN THE BOMB DISPOSAL STAGE YOU MUST DISPOSE OF A BOMB BEFORE THE FUSE BURNS ALL THE WAY DETONATING IT. YOU DISPOSE THE BOMB BY UNSOLDERING CHIPS AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. THE PLAYER MUST USE THE DIRECTIONAL PAD TO MOVE THE CURSOR FROM CHIP TO CHIP KEEPING AN EYE ON THE NUMBER ON EACH ONE. EVERY TIME THE CURSOR MOVES TO A CERTAIN BLOCK, THE NUMBER ON IT DECREASES BY ONE. THIS CREATES A PUZZLE-LIKE SCENARIO, WHERE IF THE PLAYER MAKES A MISTAKE HE MUST RESET THE DISPOSAL AND TRY AGAIN WITH LESS TIME.</desc>

THE UNCANNY X-MEN IS AN OVER-HEAD VIEW ACTION GAME. PLAYERS BEGIN BY CHOOSING TWO X-MEN FROM THE ROSTER (THE SECOND EITHER CONTROLLED BY ANOTHER PLAYER OR THE COMPUTER) AND SELECT ONE OF FIVE LEVELS INCLUDING A PRACTICE LEVEL.

HALF OF THE CHARACTERS (STORM, ICEMAN, CYCLOPS) HAVE LONG RANGE ATTACKS WHILE THE OTHER HALF (WOLVERINE, NIGHTCRAWLER, COLOSSUS) MUST GET IN CLOSE RANGE TO PUNCH THE ENEMIES. EACH X-MEN CAN ONLY SUSTAIN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HITS BEFORE BEING DEFEATED. SHOULD THE TWO X-MEN BOTH FALL IN BATTLE, PLAYERS WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE TWO MORE TO ATTEMPT THE LEVEL AGAIN UNTIL ALL OF THE X-MEN ARE USED UP.

POWER-UPS INCLUDE AN "S" WHICH STOPS TIME, INVINCIBILITY FOR A SHORT TIME AND A HEALTH RESTORE. THERE IS ALSO A MAGNET (SYMBOL OF MAGNETO) POWER-DOWN WHICH RENDERS THE X-MEN IMMOBILE FOR A SHORT TIME.</desc>

		<name>Top Gun : Dual Fighters</name>
		<desc>JUST LIKE IN THE FIRST GAME, YOU FLY AN F-14 TOMCAT IN COMBAT AGAINST THE ENEMY EQUIPPED WITH SOVIET EQUIPMENT, ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DIRECT REFERENCE TO THE SOVIET UNION ANYWHERE. THE ONLY PLOT OF THIS GAME IS TO DESTROY EVERYTHING YOU SEE, EXCLUDING THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER TO WHICH YOU MUST LAND AT THE END OF EACH LEVEL.

IN ADDITION TO THE BASIC GAME MODE WITH ANTI-SHIP, GROUND ATTACK AND SPACE BATTLE LEVELS, SIMILAR TO THE FIRST GAME, THE SECOND MISSION ADDS TWO EXTRA MODES. IN THE FIRST EXTRA MODE YOU CAN FIGHT AGAINST TOP ENEMY ACES FLYING A MIG-25 FOXBAT, ONE AT A TIME. THE SECOND EXTRA MODE IS TWO-PLAYER GAME WITH SPLIT SCREEN, IN WHICH YOU CAN FIGHT AGAINST YOUR FRIEND, BOTH FLYING TOMCATS.

YOU WILL HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST INTERESTING LEVEL BOSSES SUCH AS A GIANT TU-160 BLACKJACK BOMBER, A MI-24 HIND ATTACK CHOPPER AND AN ARMED SPACE SHUTTLE.

ANOTHER INTERESTING DETAIL ABOUT THE GAME IS THAT BETWEEN FIGHTING THE AIRCRAFT AND SURFACE OPPONENTS YOU HAVE TO DODGE BETWEEN GIANT TREES (YES, YOU READ CORRECTLY!!), LIGHTNINGS AND LASER ATTACKS.</desc>

		<name>Top Gun</name>
		<desc>TOP GUN IS LOOSELY BASED ON THE FILM OF THE SAME NAME. IT IS AN ACTION GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYER CONTROLS AN F-14 TOMCAT FIGHTER THROUGH FOUR DIFFERENT MISSIONS.

THE ACTION IS SEEN FROM A FIRST-PERSON COCKPIT VIEW. DEPENDING ON THE MISSION, DIFFERENT KINDS OF TARGETS MUST BE DESTROYED. THERE ARE ALWAYS ENEMY AIRCRAFT, BUT SOME MISSIONS INCLUDE SEA AND GROUND TARGETS AS WELL. TWO WEAPONS ARE AVAILABLE: MACHINE GUNS (WITH UNLIMITED AMMUNITION) AND MISSILES. THE PLAYER CAN CHOOSE FROM THREE TYPES OF MISSILES BEFORE A MISSION: THE MORE POWERFUL ONES CAN ONLY BE CARRIED IN LOWER QUANTITIES.

ENEMY AIRCRAFT EITHER OVERSHOOT THE PLAYERS'S PLANE FROM BEHIND AND CAN BE EASILY TAKEN DOWN, OR THEY COME FROM THE FRONT AND FIRE GUNS AND MISSILES. SOMETIMES, AN ENEMY PLANE WILL POSITION ITSELF ON THE PLAYER'S SIX. IT SHOULD BE LOST QUICKLY BY STEERING LEFT AND RIGHT, OR INSTANT DEATH FOLLOWS.

HALFWAY THROUGH MISSIONS TWO THROUGH FOUR COMES A REFUELING SEQUENCE WHERE THE FUEL PLANE'S NOZZLE MUST BE ALIGNED WITH ONE'S AIRCRAFT.

EVERY MISSION (EXCEPT THE FIRST ONE) FEATURES A FINAL MISSION TARGET, WHICH CAN TAKE A LOT MORE DAMAGE THAN REGULAR TARGETS.

EACH MISSION CONCLUDES WITH A LANDING ATTEMPT ON THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER. TO SUCCESSFULLY LAND, THE PLAYER'S PLANE MUST HAVE A CERTAIN ALTITUDE AND SPEED. SUCCESSFULLY LANDING GIVES BONUS POINTS, BUT CRASHING THE PLANE DOESN'T END THE GAME - IT SIMPLY COSTS A LIFE.</desc>

		<name>Total Recall</name>
		<desc>BASED ON THE 1990 SCHWARZENEGGER FILM OF THE SAME NAME, TOTAL RECALL FOR THE NES GENERALLY ADHERES TO THE MOVIE'S PLOT ACROSS ITS NINE LEVELS. UNLIKE THE VARIOUS PC ITERATIONS, THIS TITLE WAS CREATED BY INTERPLAY AND PUBLISHED BY ACCLAIM.

PLAYERS CONTROL DOUG QUAID AS HE PLATFORM HOPS ACROSS EARTH AND MARS IN SEARCH OF HIS STOLEN MEMORIES AND THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. A COLLECTION OF POLICE, SOLDIERS, AND CREATURES WILL TRY TO STOP HIM. QUAID'S DEFAULT ATTACK IS A STRONG PUNCH, THOUGH GUNS CAN BE KNOCKED AWAY FROM SOME GUARDS AND PICKED UP FOR USE. CUTSCENES BETWEEN CERTAIN LEVELS TELL THE MOVIE'S PLOT, AND FEATURE LIKENESSES OF THE ACTORS FROM THE FILM (INCLUDING ARNOLD).

SEQUENCES IN THE FILM ARE ALSO REPLICATED MORE TIGHTLY THAN IN THE PC VERSIONS. QUAID WILL BE CHASED BY HENCHMAN RICHTER IN THE FIRST LEVEL, AND MUST BATTLE HIS WIFE INSIDE THEIR APARTMENT. THE SECURITY X-RAY SCANNER TAKES UP A LEVEL, AS DOES THE SUBWAY BATTLE AFTER. THE PLAYER WILL ALSO COMMANDEER A MARTIAN TAXI FOR A DRIVING LEVEL INSIDE THE COLONY, AND WINDOWS CAN BE SHOT OUT ON MARS, SUCKING OUT ANY UNFORTUNATE BADDIES NEARBY.</desc>

		<desc>DESPITE WHAT THE NAME IMPLIES, WACKY RACES FOR NES IS NOT A RACING GAME, AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OTHER GAMES BEARING THE SAME NAME BUT THE LICENSE. IN THIS GAME, THE PLAYER TAKES CONTROL OF MUTTLEY, THE GRUMBLING, BUT LOYAL DOG FROM THE POPULAR HANNA-BARBERA CARTOON. HIS MASTER DASTARDLY SENDS HIS ON THREE DIFFERENT MISSIONS, EACH TAKING PLACE IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION, WHICH IN ITS TURN IS DIVIDED INTO SMALLER LEVELS. 

MUTTLEY HAS TO COMPLETE THOSE LEVELS IN A RATHER STANDARD PLATFORMER FASHION, MOVING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, JUMPING, OVERCOMING OBSTACLES AND FIGHTING VARIOUS CREATURES AND BOSS ENEMIES FROM THE CARTOON MOVIE. THE DOG'S PRIMARY WEAPON IS, UNSURPRISINGLY, HIS OWN MOUTH - BITING REGULAR ENEMIES WILL USUALLY LEAD TO THEIR INSTANT DEATH. MUTTLEY CAN ALSO COLLECT BONES SCATTERED ACROSS THE LEVELS, WHICH WILL GRANT HIM POWERFUL WEAPONS AND SKILLS OF LIMITED USE, SUCH AS A BOMB, A PROJECTILE ATTACK, AND THE ABILITY TO HEAL.</desc>

		<name>Wario no Mori</name>
		<desc>WARIO'S WOODS IS A PUZZLE GAME SIMILAR TO TETRIS OR COLUMNS, BUT WITH A TWIST. INSTEAD OF DIRECTLY CONTROLLING THE MONSTERS AND BOMBS THAT ARE FALLING DOWN, THE PLAYER CONTROLS TOAD WHO HAS TO CARRY AROUND STACKS OF MONSTERS AND BOMBS AND TO COMBINE THEM IN THE RIGHT WAY. ONE BOMB PLUS AT LEAST TWO MONSTERS OF THE SAME COLOR HAVE TO BE COMBINED TO MAKE THEM DISAPPEAR. IF FIVE OR MORE OBJECTS ARE CLEARED AT THE SAME TIME, A DIAMOND WILL APPEAR. DESTROYING THE DIAMOND WILL CLEAR ALL MONSTERS OF THE DIAMOND'S COLOR.
THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS TO PICK UP OBJECTS. THE A BUTTON LETS TOAD PICK UP THE WHOLE STACK THAT IS IN FRONT OF HIM, THE B BUTTON LETS HIM ONLY PICK UP ONE OBJECT, EVEN IF IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A STACK, THE Y BUTTON LETS HIM KICK A MONSTER OR BOMB THAT'S IN FRONT OF HIM AND THE X BUTTON PLACES HIM ON TOP OF THE STACK THAT HE IS CARRYING. HE CAN ALSO RUN UP WALLS AND STACKS TO CATCH FALLING OBJECTS OUT OF THE AIR OR TO PICK UP CERTAIN PARTS OF A STACK.

THERE ARE 5 DIFFERENT MODES OF PLAY: A "ROUND GAME" IN WHICH TOAD HAS TO CLEAR NUMEROUS LEVELS, A MATCH VERSUS A COMPUTER CONTROLLED OPPONENT, A TWO PLAYER MODE, A "TIME RACE" MODE, AND FINALLY, AN EXTENSIVE TRAINING MODE.

THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SNES AND NES VERSIONS. DUE TO A LACK OF BUTTONS, CONTROLS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN THE NES VERSION (ALTHOUGH ALL THE MOVES FROM THE SNES VERSION ARE PRESENT). ALSO, THERE IS NO VS. MODE AGAINST THE COMPUTER, BUT THE "ROUND GAME" MODE FEATURES TWO MODES OF PLAY: ONE THAT INCLUDES BOSS-FIGHTS ON EVERY LEVEL ENDING WITH A 9.</desc>

THE PLAYER ASSUMES THE ROLE OF WILLOW, THE CHOSEN ONE WHO MUST RESTORE HUMAN FORM TO THE BENEVOLENT SORCERESS FIN RAZIEL AND DESTROY THE EVIL SORCERESS, BAVMORDA. WHILE THE GAME FOLLOWS THE MOVIE'S PLOT SOMEWHAT MOST OF THE TIME, IT ALSO EXPANDS ON IT AND INTRODUCES CHARACTERS, RACES AND ENEMIES NOT FOUND IN THE MOVIE.

GAMEPLAY IS SIMILAR TO OTHER ACTION RPGS AND THE LEGEND OF ZELDA. WILLOW IS SEEN FROM A TOP DOWN PERSPECTIVE AND ALL ENEMIES ARE VISIBLE ON SCREEN. SLAYING ENEMIES WILL GIVE WILLOW EXPERIENCE POINTS, WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO HIM INCREASING HIS STATS AUTOMATICALLY. NEW WEAPONS, SHIELDS AND MAGIC ITEMS ARE FOUND IN VARIOUS TREASURE CHESTS SCATTERED ACROSS THE LAND OR GIVEN TO WILLOW AS PART OF THE PLOT. ASIDE FROM BATTLING MINOR ENEMIES WILLOW WILL ALSO FACE OFF AGAINST SEVERAL BOSS MONSTERS AS WELL AS CHARACTERS FROM THE MOVIE.</desc>

		<name>Win, Lose or Draw</name>
		<desc>WIN, LOSE OR DRAW WAS A POPULAR TV SHOW REQUIRING ARTISTIC SKILLS AND AN ABILITY TO THINK LATERALLY. A PLAYER ON YOUR TEAM DRAWS SOMETHING ON THE BIG GAME BOARD, AND YOU MUST WORK OUT WHAT IT REPRESENTS. THEY WILL BE COMMON EXPRESSIONS DEPICTED LITERALLY, SUCH AS 'BRIGHT IDEA' SHOWING A LIGHT BULB OVER SOMEBODY'S HEAD, AND 'CABIN FEVER' AS A RICKETY BUILDING NEXT TO A MAN WITH A THERMOMETER IN HIS MOUTH. 

IN THIS COMPUTERISED IMPLEMENTATION THE DRAWING PHASE OF THE GAME IS HANDLED BY THE COMPUTER, SO YOUR TASK IS SIMPLY TO GUESS THE MEANING OF THE PICTURE BY THINKING LATERALLY. YOUR TEAM HAS 60 SECONDS, AND YOU CAN GUESS REPEATEDLY, BUT THE PICTURE TAKES TIME TO TAKE SHAPE. IF YOU FAIL TO GUESS CORRECTLY, THE OPPOSITION HAS 15 SECONDS TO GUESS IT (WITH A SINGLE TRY) TO STEAL THE MONEY.</desc>

KUROS COMES ON THE SCENE AND MUST ATTEMPT TO RELIEVE MALKIL OF HIS ILL-GOTTEN COMMAND OF THE KINGDOM, ITS SUBJECTS, AND ESPECIALLY ITS PRINCESSES.

THE THIRD GAME IN THE WIZARDS &amp; WARRIORS NES FRANCHISE FEATURES A SIMILAR FEEL TO THE FIRST TWO GAMES IN THAT KUROS' MOVEMENTS ARE VERY QUICK AND NIMBLE. THE PLAYER ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO CONTROL KUROS' SWORD SWING MOVEMENTS. HOWEVER, KUROS HAS THREE DIFFERENT CHARACTER CLASSES TO ALTERNATE BETWEEN-- THE KNIGHT, THE THIEF, AND THE WIZARD. EACH REPRESENTS TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN SPEED, ATTACK STRENGTH, AND DEFENSE STRENGTH. THERE ARE VARIOUS GUILDS THROUGHOUT THE GAME DEVOTED TO TRAINING KNIGHTS, THIEVES, AND WIZARDS WHERE THE PLAYER MUST COMPLETE CHALLENGING OBSTACLE COURSES IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR CHARACTER CLASS LEVEL.

THE GAMEPLAY PROCEEDS UP A LARGE VERTICAL CITY/CASTLE WITH DANGEROUS, MONSTER-FILLED HALLWAYS AND CAVERNS. KUROS MUST KILL MONSTERS, GATHER MONEY, BUY GOODS AND SERVICES, RAISE HIS CHARACTER CLASS LEVELS, RESCUE A VARIETY OF APPREHENDED PRINCESSES AND GATHER SPECIAL JEWELS, ALL IN A QUEST TO FACE OFF WITH MALKIL ONCE AGAIN.</desc>

		<desc>IT'S THE YEAR 2777. DUE TO NUCLEAR WARS AND NATURAL DISASTERS, EARTH'S POPULATION HAS DECREASED DRAMATICALLY AND ONLY FIVE ISLAND ARE LEFT, FORMING THE NATION OF XEXYZ. IN XEXYZ, HUMANS, SPIRITS AND FAERIES HAVE LIVED PEACEFULLY FOR CENTURIES UNDER THE REIGN OF KING XEU STAR. ONE DAY, XEXYZ IS ATTACKED BY GORUZA WHO MURDERS THE KING, BUILDS MECHANICAL CASTLES ON EACH ISLAND AND CAPTURES THE QUEEN OF EACH ISLAND. YOU TAKE ON THE ROLE OF A SOLDIER NAMED APOLLO WHO WANTS TO PUT AN END TO GORUZA'S REIGN.

CONTROLLING APOLLO, IT IS YOUR TASK TO FREE ALL FIVE ISLANDS. FREEING AN ISLAND IS DONE IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT PHASES THAT FEATURE 'JUMP'N SHOOT' AS WELL AS 'SHOOTER' LEVELS (CALLED "ACTION MODE" AND "SHOOTING MODE"). THE FIRST LEVEL OF EACH ISLAND IS A JUMP'N SHOOT LEVEL THAT CONTAINS MANY DOORS TO SHOPS, BONUS GAMES, FRIENDLY NPCS OR MID-BOSSES. NPCS WILL SOMETIMES GIVE YOU IMPORTANT HINTS, ITEMS OR WEAPONS; BONUS GAMES CAN BE PLAYED TO WIN SOME MONEY ("BALLS"); DEFEATING MID-BOSSES (AND THEREBY FREEING A FAIRY) WILL GET YOU A CASH REWARD AND SHOPS ALSO OFFER WEAPONS AND ITEMS. WEAPONS DIFFER LARGELY IN ATTACK POWER AND RANGE. ITEMS HAVE TEMPORARY EFFECTS SUCH AS INVINCIBILITY OR IMPROVED JUMPING ABILITIES. IN AN ISLAND'S FIRST LEVEL, YOU WILL HAVE TO FIND A SECRET ROOM AND DEFEAT A BOSS, FOR WHICH YOU WILL RECEIVE A FORCE STAR THAT IS NEEDED TO GAIN ACCESS TO A MECHANICAL CASTLE. MECHANICAL CASTLES LOOK SIMILAR TO OTHER JUMP'N SHOOT LEVELS BUT ARE MORE COMPLEX.

ONCE YOU HAVE MADE YOUR WAY TO A "CYBORG RIDER", A SELF-SCROLLING SHOOTER SEQUENCE STARTS IN WHICH YOU HAVE TO SHOOT YOUR WAY THROUGH LOTS OF ENEMIES WHILE PICKING UP SPEED AND WEAPON POWER-UPS.
AT THE END OF THIS SEQUENCE YOU WILL LEAVE THE CYBORG RIDER, AND STEP ONTO A FLOATING PLATFORM FOR A BOSS FIGHT. AFTER THE BOSS IS DEFEATED, ANOTHER SHOOTER SEQUENCE WITH ANOTHER BOSS AT THE END AWAITS, BUT THIS TIME, THE BOSS IF FOUGHT FROM THE CYBORG RIDER. AFTER DEFEATING THIS BOSS, YOU START THE PROCESS OVER WITH A JUMP'N SHOOT LEVEL.</desc>

ON BOARD ARE SPECIAL WEAPONS TO HELP YOU BLAST YOUR WAY THROUGH TWELVE SCREENS OF ENEMY CREATURES AND DESTROY THE SYSTEM'S HOME BASE. ZANAC IS DIVIDED INTO 12 "AREAS", WHICH LOOK LIKE PLANETS. THE VARIOUS LOCATIONS RANGE FROM DESERTS TO JUNGLES AND FROM OCEANS TO INDUSTRIAL ZONES, FEATURING MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF ENEMIES.

ZANAC'S UNIQUE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM CAN INTENSIFY THE ACTION BASED UPON YOUR LEVEL OF SKILL. THE BETTER YOU ARE, THE MORE POWERFUL "THE SYSTEM". EXAMPLES OF THE A.I. (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) IN THIS GAME: THE ENEMIES ARE GENERALLY COMING RANDOMLY WITH THEIR BEHAVIOR BASED ON FACTORS LIKE THE POSITION YOUR SHIP IN THE SCREEN, THE PLACE YOU LAST DIED; THE SHOOT SPEED OF THE ENEMIES AND BOSSES DO ALSO VARY.

AT THE END OF EACH AREA (LEVEL) YOU'LL HAVE TO FIGHT THE AREA BOSS. AREA BOSSES ARE MAINLY BASED AROUND HUGE, SCREEN-FILLING BUNKER BASES CONSISTING OF GUN TURRETS AND A "CORE". YOU HAVE LIMITED TIME FOR FIGHTING AGAINST THE AREA BOSS - A TIME OUT COULD MEAN FAILURE IN ENTERING THE NEXT STAGE, AND WITH THE TIME RUNNING, MORE AND MORE ENEMIES WERE ATTACKING AS PENALTY.</desc>

		<name>Zelda no Densetsu 1 : The Hyrule Fantasy</name>
		<desc>IN ONE OF THE DARKEST TIMES IN THE KINGDOM OF HYRULE, A YOUNG, POINTY-EARED BOY NAMED LINK TAKES ON AN EPIC QUEST TO RESTORE THE FRAGMENTED TRIFORCE OF WISDOM AND SAVE THE PRINCESS ZELDA FROM THE CLUTCHES OF THE EVIL, POWER-HUNGRY GANON.

THE LEGEND OF ZELDA FOR THE NES MARKS THE FIRST ACTION-ADVENTURE TITLE OF THE POPULAR NINTENDO SERIES. PLAYERS MUST MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE VARIOUS FORESTS, GRAVEYARDS, PLAINS, AND DESERTS OF THE OVERWORLD TO FIND THE SECRET ENTRANCES OF THE EIGHT DUNGEONS IN AN ATTEMPT TO PIECE TOGETHER THE BROKEN TRIFORCE. ONCE ALL PIECES ARE JOINED, LINK WILL BE ABLE TO GAIN ENTRY TO DEATH MOUNTAIN, HOME OF GANON, AND PRISON OF PRINCESS ZELDA.

THE GAME IS DRAWN IN A TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE. LINK BEGINS HIS QUEST IN THE OVERWORLD, WHICH FEATURES FORESTS, MOUNTAINS AND LAKES AND IS DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL SCREENS. LINK CAN EXPLORE THE OVERWORLD FREELY, THOUGH WHEN HE ENTERS A SCREEN, HE WILL ENCOUNTER SEVERAL ENEMIES. HE CAN ATTACK THEM WITH HIS SWORD. IF LINK IS AT FULL HEALTH, HE CAN TOSS HIS SWORD TO ATTACK ENEMIES FROM AFAR, BUT WHEN HE IS HURT, EVEN SLIGHTLY, HE CAN ONLY FIGHT IN MELEE RANGE. 

LINK'S HEALTH IS REPRESENTED BY HEARTS; INITIALLY HE CAN HAVE A MAXIMUM OF THREE HEARTS, BUT AS HE PROGRESSES IN THE GAME, HE WILL FIND HEART CONTAINERS THAT INCREASE HIS MAXIMUM HEALTH. THE ENEMIES ARE VARIED - SOME ATTACK FROM UP CLOSE, SOME SHOOT PROJECTILES. WHEN KILLED, THEY OFTEN LEAVE BEHIND AN ITEM - A HEART TO RESTORE ENERGY, RUPEES THAT FUNCTION AS MONEY (AND CAN BE USED TO BUY STUFF IN VARIOUS SHOPS IN THE OVERWORLD), OR BOMBS WHICH CAN BE PICKED UP AND SET DOWN TO ATTACK ENEMIES OR DESTROY SOME WALLS. WHEN ENEMIES ARE KILLED, THEY STAY DEAD AND WILL NOT RE-APPEAR ONCE THE SCREEN IS ENTERED AGAIN. 

THERE ARE OTHER ITEMS TO FIND IN THE GAME; SOME FUNCTION AS WEAPONS, WHILE OTHERS ARE USED TO SOLVE PUZZLES. 

TO FIND THE TRIFORCE PIECES, LINK MUST EXPLORE DUNGEONS. ONCE HE FINDS AN ENTRANCE TO THE DUNGEON AND GOES IN, HE MUST EXPLORE THE ROOMS, FIGHT ENEMIES AND COLLECT KEYS UNTIL HE FINDS THE BOSS MONSTER HE MUST DEFEAT. HE WILL THEN BE ABLE TO PICK UP A TRIFORCE PIECE. ONCE HE DOES SO, HOWEVER, ALL THE MONSTERS IN THE OVERWORLD COME BACK TO LIFE. 

IF LINK DIES ON HIS QUEST, HE CAN CONTINUE IT; HE WILL GO BACK TO HIS START POSITION IN THE OVERWORLD, BUT WITH THE ITEMS HE MANAGED TO COLLECT SO FAR. WHEN LINK FINISHES HIS QUEST, THE PL;AYER CAN CHOOSE TO PLAY THE "2ND QUEST", WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A HARDER VERSION OF THE GAME. 

THE LEGEND OF ZELDA IS KNOWN FOR SEVERAL FACTORS THAT WERE REVOLUTIONARY AT THE TIME: A FULL WORLD THAT COULD BE FREELY EXPLORED, POWER-UPS THAT WOULD PERMANENTLY ENHANCE YOUR CHARACTER'S ABILITIES, AND A BATTERY BACK-UP SAVE FEATURE THAT ALLOWED PLAYERS TO RETAIN THEIR PROGRESS INSTEAD OF HAVING TO START OVER. THE GAMEPLAY BALANCED OUT FREQUENT ACTION SEQUENCES WITH DISCOVERY, SECRETS, AND EXPLORATION.</desc>

		<desc>IN 1999 A MYSTERIOUS OBJECT CRASHES INTO THE DESERT AND A MYSTERIOUS CREATURE, DARC SEED APPEARS. USING MAGNETIC POWERS, HE SOON TURNS THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES INTO ZOMBIES AND EXERTS INFLUENCE OVER VARIOUS WEAPONS AND OBJECTS. AMONG THE WEAPONS DARC SEED CLAIMS IS THE LEGENDARY SAMURAI SWORD, SHURA. WHEN THE GREAT HEAD OF THE SAMURAI, NAMAKUBI HEARS ABOUT THIS, HE SETS OUT FOR THE UNITED STATES TO DEFEAT DARC SEED AND RECLAIM THE SWORD.

WHAT MAKES THIS SO UNUSUAL HOWEVER IS THAT "GREAT HEAD OF THE SAMURAI" IS TO BE TAKEN LITERALLY AND NAMAKUBI THEREFORE IS A GIANT DISEMBODIED HEAD. HIS MAIN WEAPON IS THE ABILITY TO SHOOT PROJECTILES FROM HIS EYES AND BOMBS FROM HIS MOUTH WHICH HE FIRES AT VARIOUS ENEMIES, OBJECTS AND BUILDINGS. FURTHERMORE, SHOULD A ZOMBIE HOSTAGE FALL OUT A WINDOW HE CAN RESCUE THEM TO SLOWLY POWER UP HIS ATTACKS.

THE GAME IS A SIDE-SCROLLING SHOOTER IN WHICH THE PLAYER CAN CONTROL NAMAKUBI'S MOVEMENT ACROSS THE SCREEN AND THE ABILITY TO SHOOT. ENEMIES REDUCE HEALTH BY VARYING AMOUNTS, HEALTH CAN BE RESTORED BY INCREASING THE PLAYER'S SCORE. THE GAME FEATURES FOUR DISTINCT STAGES WITH 2 DIFFICULTY SETTINGS.</desc>
