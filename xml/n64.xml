		<desc>O JOGADOR CONTROLA UM SNOWBOARDER EM UM DOS SEIS MODOS. 1080º TEM DOIS MODOS DE MANOBRA (TRICK ATTACK E DISPUTA/CONTEST) TRÊS MODOS DE CORRIDA (CORRIDA/RACE, TIME ATTACK, E MULTI-JOGADOR), UM MODO DE TREINO, E UM MODO DE OPÇÕES. O OBJETIVO DO JOGO É CHEGAR RAPIDAMENTE AO FINAL DO ESTÁGIO OU RECEBER O MAIOR NÚMERO DE PONTOS POR COMBINAÇÕES DE MANOBRAS.

EM 1080º EXISTEM DOIS MODOS DE MANOBRA, TRICK ATTACK E DISPUTA/CONTEST, OS JOGADORES ACUMULAM PONTOS POR COMPLETAR AS MANOBRAS. NO MODO CONTEST (OU "DISPUTA" EM TRADUÇÃO LIVRE), OS JOGADORES REALIZAM MANOBRAS E DESLIZAM SOBRE BANDEIRAS PARA PONTOS. O MODO TRICK ATTACK EXIGE QUE OS JOGADORES REALIZEM UMA SÉRIE DE MANOBRAS ATRAVÉS DE UM DETERMINADO ESTÁGIO. O JOGO APRESENTA 25 MANOBRAS, CADA UM DELAS É REALIZADA AO USAR UMA COMBINAÇÃO DAS POSIÇÕES CIRCULARES DO ANALÓGICO DO CONTROLE, O BOTÃO R, E O BOTÃO B; OS PONTOS SÃO CALCULADOS COM BASE NA COMPLEXIDADE E DURAÇÃO DA MANOBRA. OS DOIS TIPOS DE MANOBRAS SÃO AS MANOBRAS DE AGARRAMENTO (GRAB TRICKS), EM QUE A PRANCHA É AGARRADA DE UMA MANEIRA ESPECÍFICA, OU MANOBRAS DE GIRO (SPIN TRICKS), NA QUAL O SNOWBOARDER GIRA A PRANCHA EM UM CERTO NÚMERO DE GRAUS. PARA SER EFETUADO O GIRO DE 1080º NECESSITA DE NOVE AÇÕES, MAIS DO QUALQUER OUTRA MANOBRA NO JOGO.</desc>

		<name>Big Mountain 2000</name>
		<desc>BIG MOUNTAIN 2000 IS A SPORTS GAME WHERE YOU CAN CHOOSE TO RACE WITH EITHER A SNOWBOARD OR A SKI. THERE ARE SIX CHARACTERS (PLUS THREE UNLOCKABLES) TO CHOOSE FROM, EACH WITH DIFFERENT SKILLS AND THREE MODES IN TOTAL  TWO OF THEM ARE SINGLE PLAYER AND THE OTHER ONE IS A MULTIPLAYER.

1. CHAMPIONSHIP: IN CHAMPIONSHIP YOU CAN SELECT ONE OF THE AVAILABLE PLAYERS AND CHOOSE THE STYLE YOU WANT  SKI OR SNOWBOARD.  YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE EACH PLAYERS EQUIPMENT WHICH INCLUDES SKI/SNOWBOARD AND CLOTHES. THE GAME ALSO LETS YOU CHOOSE IN WHICH STAGE YOU WANT TO COMPETE AND THE RACE TYPE YOU WANT TO PLAY. RACE TYPE INCLUDES THREE OPTIONS  FREE RIDE, SLALOM AND GIANT SLALOM. IN FREE RIDE YOU COMPETE AGAINST 3 MORE CPU PLAYERS, YOU MUST FINISH FIRST AND BEFORE TIME, WHICH CAN BE RENEWED AT EVERY CHECKPOINT, RUNS OUT. IN SLALOM AND GIANT SLALOM YOU MUST PASS THROUGH THE FLAGS THAT ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE COURSE AND AGAIN LIKE IN FREE RIDE FINISH FIRST. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SLALOM-GIANT SLALOM ARE THE LATERS COURSE BEING WIDER AND THE FLAGS LESS. BY SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING ANY OF THE ABOVE YOUR PLAYERS SKILLS LIKE CORNERING, ACCELERATION, ETC. ARE INCREASED.

2. 2P BATTLE: IN 2P BATTLE TWO HUMAN PLAYERS CAN COMPETE IN ANY OF THE FREE RIDE-SLALOM-GIANT SLALOM RACES. IT IS POSSIBLE TO EITHER CHOOSE A PLAYER FROM THE GAME OR LOAD A PREVIOUSLY SAVED PLAYER DATA FROM A CONTROLLER PAK. THERE ARE ALSO NO RESTRICTIONS ON THE STYLE EACH PLAYER WILL CHOOSE. FOR EXAMPLE ONE MAY CHOOSE TO PLAY WITH A SKIER AND THE OTHER WITH A SNOWBOARDER.

3. TIME ATTACK: THERE ARE NO OTHER COMPETITORS IN THIS MODE  JUST YOU RACING AGAINST TIME.</desc>

		<desc>GET OUT OF THE WAY!  A NUCLEAR MISSILE CARRIER IS OUT OF CONTROL ON A ONE WAY-SET PATH, AND UNLESS THAT PATH IS CLEARED, IT WILL EXPLODE AS SOON AS IT MAKES CONTACT WITH ANYTHING, DESTROYING THE WORLD. IT IS UP TO YOU TO CLEAR THE PATH SO THAT NOTHING GETS IN THE WAY OF THE CARRIER.

BLAST CORPS IS A MIX OF AN ACTION AND A PUZZLE GAME WHERE DESTRUCTION IS KEY. AT THE START OF EACH LEVEL THE PLAYER IS GIVEN A CERTAIN VEHICLE (RANGING FROM ROBOTIC SUITS, TRUCKS, OR BULLDOZERS), AND ARE TOLD TO CLEAR THE PATH FOR THE CARRIER. PLAYERS NEED TO USE THEIR HEAVY-DUTY EQUIPMENT TO DESTROY ANY BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES, OR MONUMENTS THAT STAND IN THE PATH OF THE CARRIER. THE DIFFICULTY INCREASES AS PROGRESS IS MADE, THOUGH. SMALLER VEHICLES DON'T AFFECT CERTAIN BUILDINGS, AND SOMETIMES ITS NOT EVEN A BUILDING THAT'S IN THE WAY. THE PLAYER MUST USE THE RESOURCES AROUND THEM TO CLEAR THE PATH. PLAYERS MAY NEED A TRAIN FLATBED TO FILL A GAP, OR A CRANE TO MOVE BOXES OUT OF THE WAY. THE CARRIER IS ALWAYS MOVING, SO ONCE THE PLAYER IS DONE DESTROYING ONE OBSTRUCTION, THEY MUST GET TO THE NEXT ONE QUICKLY. WHILE PLAYERS PURSUE THEIR MISSION THEY MUST ALSO FIND SIX SCIENTISTS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE GLOBE TO FORM A THINK-TANK TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THE CARRIER HAS TO LEAVE EARTH, AND IT'S YOUR JOB TO ENSURE THAT IT DOES!

BLAST CORPS FEATURES MANY SECRETS TO FIND. BESIDES CLEARING EACH PATH FOR THE CARRIER, PLAYERS CAN GO BACK TO A LEVEL ONCE TS OVER TO TAKE THEIR TIME AND EXPLORE. TO FULLY COMPLETE A LEVEL, PLAYERS MUST ALSO FIND RDU'S (RADIATION DISPERSAL UNITS) WHICH LIGHT UP ON THE GROUND WHEN THE PLAYER IS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THEM. PLAYERS MUST ALSO DESTROY ALL OF THE BUILDINGS, AND RESCUE ALL OF THE HOMELESS CIVILIANS, WHICH IS DONE BY THE T-CHOPPER THAT ACCOMPANIES THE PLAYER ON EVERY MISSION. THERE ARE ALSO DOZENS OF SECRET TIME TRIAL LEVELS THAT CAN BE FOUND BY ACTIVATING SPECIAL SATELLITE DISHES HIDDEN THROUGHOUT THE LEVELS. IF THE PLAYER MANAGES TO GET ALL OF THE SECRETS IN A LEVEL THEY RECEIVE A SECOND MEDAL, AND ONCE ALL OF THE GOLD MEDALS ARE FOUND THE DEVELOPERS HAVE A TINY MESSAGE FOR THEM...</desc>

		<desc>THE INHABITANTS OF BOMBER WORLD HAVE A UNIQUE PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE: IF SOMETHING GETS IN THE WAY, BLOW IT UP. NOW YOU, TOO, CAN JOIN IN THE FUN WITH HUDSON SOFT'S BOMBERMAN 64.

IN BOMBERMAN 64'S ALL-NEW ONE-PLAYER ADVENTURE MODE, MARAUDERS HAVE SET THEIR SIGHTS ON BOMBERMAN'S PEACEFUL PLANET. YOU'LL EXPLORE LABYRINTHINE LEVELS BY DROPPING BOMBS, SOLVING PUZZLES AND FINDING HIDDEN ITEMS. THE ACTION TAKES PLACE ACROSS FIVE BRIGHTLY COLORED WORLDS: A SMOLDERING VOLCANO, RUINED CASTLE, ICY MOUNTAIN RANGE, ORBITING SPACE STATION AND STORYBOOK VILLAGE. FIND ALL 100 GOLD CARDS IN THE FIRST FIVE WORLDS AND YOU CAN ACCESS A SIXTH WORLD.

TO MAXIMIZE YOUR SCORE, YOU'LL NEED TO FINISH EACH OF THE 20 LEVELS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. DEADLINES ARE TIGHTER ON THE HARD DIFFICULTY SETTING. DESPITE THE PREVALENCE OF INCENDIARY DEVICES, BOMBERMAN 64'S OVERHEAD PERSPECTIVE, CARTOON-LIKE GRAPHICS AND BRIGHT PALETTE GIVES THE GAME THE CHEERFUL FEEL OF SUPER MARIO RPG. 

IT'S BOMBERMAN 64'S MULTIPLAYER MODE, THOUGH, THAT REALLY BLOWS THE SOCKS OFF THE PYROTECHNICIANS AT POWER SOURCE. IN SINGLE BATTLE MODE, DASHING ABOUT THE BAFFLING ARENAS AND BLOWING EACH OTHER TO SMITHEREENS PROVES TO BE, WELL, A BLAST. TEAM BATTLE MODE IS A HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE VERSION OF CAPTURE-THE-FLAG. YOUR GOAL HERE IS TO DESTROY THE ENEMY TEAM'S GEMS WHILE PROTECTING YOUR OWN. 

YOU CAN CHOOSE THE NUMBER AND DURATION OF BATTLES. YOU CAN ALSO CHOOSE FROM THREE LEVELS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR CPU-CONTROLLED BOMBERS. WHEN THE GHOST OPTION IS SELECTED, YOUR LITTLE GUY WILL RETURN AS A WISPY DOUBLE OF HIS OLD SELF AFTER HE'S GONE BOOM. GHOSTS CAN CONTROL A NORMAL BOMBERMAN, BUT THEY CANNOT DEPLOY BOMBS.

YOU'LL SAVOR BOMBERMAN 64'S SNEAKY NEW FEATURES, INCLUDING EXTREMELY HIGH EXPLOSIVES AND THE ABILITY TO TOSS OR KICK YOUR BOMBS DIAGONALLY. OTHER NEW FEATURES INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO PUMP UP BOMBS, KNOCK FOES UNCONSCIOUS, GRAB AND TOSS UNCONSCIOUS FOES, AND TOSS OR KICK BOMBS DIAGONALLY. BOMBERMAN 64 IS A BLAST!</desc>

		<desc>CARMAGEDDON É UM JOGO ESSENCIALMENTE ANÁRQUICO, VOCÊ É POSTO EM UMA CORRIDA APARENTEMENTE NORMAL, MAS SEM LIMITES. O JOGADOR PODE OPTAR POR ATROPELAR OS PEDESTRES OU DESTRUIR SEUS ADVERSÁRIOS SE NÃO AGRADAR O SIMPLES "COMPLETAR A VOLTA EM MENOS TEMPO". VENCER AS PROVAS PODE SE DAR DE TRÊS MANEIRAS DIFERENTES; COMPLETANDO AS VOLTAS NO TEMPO, MATANDO TODOS OS PEDESTRES DA PROVA OU DESTRUINDO OS CARROS ADVERSÁRIOS. A CADA CORRIDA O JOGADOR TEM UM TEMPO PARA COMPLETAR A PROVA. ESSE TEMPO PODE AUMENTAR DE ACORDO COM A QUANTIDADE QUE VOCÊ COLETA DE BÔNUS, ENTRE: CHECKPOINTS, DANOS AOS COMPETIDORES, PEDESTRES ATROPELADOS, FORMAS DE ATROPELAMENTOS OU OBJETOS BÔNUS.

EM MUITOS PAÍSES (INCLUINDO ALEMANHA E INGLATERRA) CARMAGEDDON FOI LANÇADO COM O CONTEÚDO DE VIOLÊNCIA LIMITADO OU CENSURADO, TROCANDO OS SERES HUMANOS POR ZUMBIS OU ROBÔS. A VERSÃO BRASILEIRA NÃO INCLUÍA ESSA MODIFICAÇÃO, PORÉM, AO INSTALAR ERA NECESSÁRIO À CRIAÇÃO DE UMA SENHA, SÓ COM ELA ERA PERMITIDO JOGAR COM SERES HUMANOS (MODO SANGUE), SEM ELA O GAME ERA INICIADO COM A VERSÃO DE ROBÔS.

PORÉM, MESMO COM SENHAS DE SEGURANÇA, O GAME ACABOU SENDO PROIBIDO NO BRASIL, O ALTO NÍVEL DE CARNIFICINA E VIOLÊNCIA EXPLICITA FOI O BASTANTE PARA QUE EM MENOS DE UMA SEMANA O GOVERNO BRASILEIRO RETIRASSE O PRODUTO DAS PRATELEIRAS.

A ATITUDE DO GOVERNO TEVE O EFEITO CONTRÁRIO AO ESPERADO: COM A PROIBIÇÃO, CARMAGEDDON SE TORNOU UM DOS MAIS CONHECIDOS JOGOS JÁ LANÇADOS NO BRASIL, TENDO CIRCULADO DIVERSAS CÓPIAS DO MESMO APÓS A VEICULAÇÃO DA NOTÍCIA DA PROIBIÇÃO DO JOGO. NA TELEVISÃO A NOTÍCIA MOSTRAVA CENAS DO JOGO, O QUE FOMENTOU A CURIOSIDADE DAQUELES QUE NEM CONHECIAM O PRODUTO.</desc>

		<desc>SET IN THE YEAR 1844, THE GAME STARS THE MAN-BEAST CORNELL IN HIS QUEST TO PREVENT HIS ADOPTIVE SISTER, ADA, FROM BEING USED AS A SACRIFICE TO RESURRECT DRACULA. THE GAME OPENS AS CORNELL ARRIVES AT HIS VILLAGE, WHICH HAS BEEN BURNED TO THE GROUND BY DRACULA'S MINIONS. HE FINDS ADA'S PENDANT IN A DOORWAY AND FOLLOWS HER SCENT TO DRACULA'S CASTLE.

DURING THE COURSE OF THE GAME, CORNELL COMES UPON A GRAND ESTATE OWNED BY THE OLDREY FAMILY: J.A. OLDREY, THE MASTER OF THE VILLA, MARY, HIS WIFE, AND HENRY, THEIR SON. GILLES DE RAIS AND ACTRISE HAVE TURNED OLDREY SENIOR INTO A VAMPIRE. AT MARY'S REQUEST, CORNELL GUIDES HENRY TO SAFETY. LATER IN LIFE, HENRY RETURNS TO CASTLEVANIA TO SAVE KIDNAPPED CHILDREN.</desc>

		<desc>KONAMI'S LONG-RUNNING SERIES OF CASTLEVANIA GAMES MAKES ITS DEBUT ON THE N64. THE TRADITIONAL 2D GRAPHICS HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND; THIS IS THE FIRST CASTLEVANIA GAME IN 3D. HOWEVER, THE GOAL OF THE GAME REMAINS THE SAME: KICK SOME VAMPIRE BUTT AS YOU BATTLE THE EVIL COUNT DRACULA AND HIS MINIONS IN THIS PLATFORMER.

THE PLAYER CAN EITHER CHOOSE TO BE REINHARDT SCHNEIDER (FOR THE TRADITIONAL WHIP ACTION) OR CARRIE FERNANDEZ (WHO USES MAGICAL POWERS). BOTH CHARACTERS HAVE THEIR OWN STORY LINE. A NICE FEATURE IS THE PRESENCE OF AN IN-GAME CLOCK WHICH CHANGES THE TIME OF THE DAY (EITHER DAY OR NIGHT).

REINHARDT &amp; CARRIE BOTH APPEAR AGAIN IN THE SECOND CASTLEVANIA GAME FOR THE N64: CASTLEVANIA: LEGACY OF DARKNESS, WHICH HAS NEW LAYOUTS FOR THE LEVELS OF THIS GAME.</desc>

		<desc>CENTRE COURT TENNIS IS A TENNIS GAME THAT DOES NOT TAKE ITSELF TOO SERIOUSLY. AFTER CREATING YOUR LEGO-LIKE CHARACTER, YOU ARE SET TO GO! 

THE BASIC GAME FEATURES A MULTIPLAYER MODE (UP TO 4 PLAYERS), A TOURNAMENT MODE AND AN EXHIBITION MODE. YOU ALSO HAVE FOUR MINI-GAMES, "TENNIS COURT BINGO", "BURNING BARRELS", "RUN AND GUN" &amp; KNOCK'EM DOWN", WHERE YOUR GOAL IS TO HIT CERTAIN OBJECTS IN THE TENNIS FIELD. YOU CAN WIN SPECIAL PRICES FOR GETTING ENOUGH POINTS.

ADDITIONALLY, YOU HAVE A SPECIAL CHALLENGE MODE WHERE YOU HAVE TO PLAY AGAINST YOUR OPPONENT IN ODD CONDITIONS - YOUR TENNIS FIELD MIGHT BE ROTATING, MADE FROM ICE OR ABOUT TO EXPLODE, TO NAME A FEW. BEAT YOUR FOE AND YOU WILL BE REWARDED WITH A PIECE CLOTHING OR ITEM OF YOUR CHOOSING FROM YOUR OPPONENT'S DRESSING ROOM. LOSE AND YOU LOSE AN ITEM THAT YOUR OPPONENT PICKED. KEEP ON LOSING AND YOU HAVE TO PLAY YOUR GAMES WEARING NOTHING BUT YOUR UNDERWEAR, WHICH MAKES THE GAME LIKE A SORT OF FAMILY-FRIENDLY STRIP TENNIS.</desc>

HE IS NOT TRYING TO SAVE A PRINCESS EITHER; HIS MISSION IS TO BLOW ISLANDS UP WITH TNT!

WITH 3D GRAPHICS AND SOME PLATFORM ELEMENTS, CHARLIE BLAST'S TERRITORY, A REMAKE OF KABLOOEY, IS A MODERNIZATION OF ONE OF THE CLASSIC PUZZLE GENRES WHERE YOUR GOAL IS TO PUSH CRATES INTO THE CORRECT SPOTS. 

EVERY LEVEL IS AN ISLAND. ON EVERY ISLAND YOU HAVE AT LEAST ONE BOMB AND ONE TNT BOX. YOUR GOAL IS TO PUSH ALL OF THEM NEXT TO EACH OTHERS AND THEN BLOW EVERYTHING UP IN A HUGE CHAIN REACTION. WHEN YOU DO, YOU ADVANCE A LEVEL. YOU CANNOT PULL THE CRATES BUT YOU CAN CLIMB OVER THEM.</desc>

AFTER THE BRIEFING FROM YOUR XO, YOU ARE SET TO DESTROY SOMETHING - TANKS, OTHER HELICOPTERS, PLANES, RADARS, BUILDINGS ETC. WHILE THE MISSION ONLY REQUIRES YOU TO DO SOMETHING SPECIFIC, DESTROYING EVERYTHING GIVES YOU BONUSES AND MONEY, WHICH YOU CAN THEN USE TO BUY MORE HEAVY-DUTY MISSILES BETWEEN THE MISSIONS.

IF YOU LOOK AT THE SCREENSHOTS, YOU MIGHT THINK THAT CHOPPER ATTACK IS A HELICOPTER SIMULATION. IT'S NOT. YOUR ELEVATION IS FIXED. THERE ARE NO PHYSICS. YOU HAVE BOSS FIGHTS WITH GIANT CHOPPERS. THE GAME IS PURE 3D ACTION, PLAIN AND SIMPLE.</desc>

IN MOST MISSIONS YOU HAVE TO BUILD A BASE FIRST TO BUILD NEW UNITS AND STRUCTURES. MOST IMPORTANT ARE THE SPECIAL HARVESTERS, WHICH COLLECT TIBERIUM AND DELIVER IT TO A REFINERY, WHERE IT'S CONVERTED INTO MONEY - MONEY WHICH IS NEEDED TO CREATE ADDITIONAL UNITS.

THE GAME ALSO FEATURES FMV MISSION BRIEFINGS AND VICTORY CUTSCENES.</desc>

CRUIS'N USA THRILLED RACERS WITH A SCENIC TRIP ACROSS THE HIGHWAYS OF AMERICA, BUT THIS TIME THE ACTION WILL TAKE YOU ALL AROUND THE WORLD. EACH TRACK IS PACKED FULL OF REALISTIC SCENERY AND AUTHENTIC LANDMARKS, SO PLAYING THIS GAME COULD SAVE YOU A LOT OF DOUGH ON TRAVEL EXPENSES. YOU CAN CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE SPHINX, THE STATUE OF LIBERTY, AND THE MAYAN RUINS WITHOUT LEAVING THE SECURITY OF YOUR LIVING ROOM COUCH. 

 IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A REALISTIC RACING SIMULATION WITH REAL WORLD PHYSICS, THEN THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT THE GAME FOR YOU. THE GRAPHICS ARE REALISTIC, BUT THE ACTUAL GAME PLAY IS TWISTED TO THE EXTREME. EVEN THOUGH BLAZING ACROSS THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA MAY BE UNBELIEVABLE, IT CERTAINLY IS FUN. YOU CAN LEAP-FROG OVER A SEMI TRUCK WITH A POLICE CAR, OR PERFORM A BACK FLIP WITH A MILITARY ATV. ADD TO THIS A BONUS RACE THAT TAKES PLACE ON THE MOON, AND YOU HAVE A GOOD IDEA OF MIDWAY'S OVER-THE-TOP EXECUTION OF THE CRUIS'N CONCEPT. 

MANY OF US WILL NEVER GET THE CHANCE TO VISIT THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS, LET ALONE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRIVE A SCREAMING AMBULANCE STRAIGHT THROUGH THEM. CRUIS'N WORLD PROVIDES FUN FANTASY RACING ACTION, AND THE BEST THING ABOUT IT IS THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR LUGGAGE GETTING LEFT BEHIND IN RUSSIA.</desc>

IN THIS ADDITION, UP TO 4 PLAYERS CAN PLAY, WITH OPTIONS INCLUDING A STRAIGHT OUT DERBY, CAPTURE THE FLAG, ARENA BATTLES AND MUCH MORE. 

THERE ARE 12 SINGLE PLAYER TRACKS TO GO THROUGH, AND PLENTY OF CARS TO USE, INCLUDING A TAXI CAR (WHICH YOU MUST COMPLETE THE GAME TO UNLOCK).</desc>

		<name>Diddy Kong Racing</name>
		<desc>IT'S AN ISLAND TAKEOVER WHEN THE EVIL SPACE WIZARD, WIZPIG, DISCOVERS TIGER ISLAND!  AFTER THE ISLANDS PRIZED RACETRACKS BECOME SEALED UP, TIMBER TIGER CONTACTS HIS FRIEND DIDDY KONG TO HELP HIM RECLAIM THE RACETRACKS AND SAVE THE ISLAND BEFORE HIS PARENTS RETURN.  ALONG FOR THE RIDE ARE THE KREMLING SPY KRUNCH, BUMPER BADGER, BANJO (PRIOR TO MEETING KAZOOIE IN BANJO-KAZOOIE), PRE-SWEARY CONKER, TIPTUP TURTLE, AND PIPSY MOUSE.

DIDDY KONG RACING IS A RACING GAME WITH SIMILARITIES TO MARIO KART 64, IN THAT YOU RACE WITH A VARIETY OF CHEERY RACERS WHILE USING WEAPONS.  HOWEVER, THE SIMILARITIES END THERE.  DKR INCLUDES AN ADVENTURE MODE, WHICH FEATURES BOSSES, AN OVERWORLD TO EXPLORE, MANY HIDDEN SECRETS, THE ADDITION OF HOVERCRAFTS AND PLANES, AND A UNIQUE WAY OF RACING CALLED THE "SILVER COIN CHALLENGE".  IN THIS MODE, IN ADDITION TO COMING FIRST, YOU MUST ALSO FIND THE EIGHT SILVER COINS DEVIOUSLY HIDDEN THROUGHOUT THE COURSES (SOME IN ALTERNATE PATHS).

THE GAME ALSO FEATURES A STRATEGIC METHOD OF USING WEAPONS.  EACH COLORED BALLOON ON THE TRACK MATCHES A SPECIFIC WEAPON, AND COLLECTING THE SAME TYPE OF BALLOON MULTIPLE TIMES IN A ROW POWERS IT UP (TO A MAXIMUM OF THREE TIMES).  THIS GIVES THE PLAYER THE CHOICE OF SNATCHING EVERY BALLOON AVAILABLE AND USING IT IMMEDIATELY, OR STORING THE EXISTING WEAPON, AND USING A MORE POWERFUL VERSION OF IT LATER.

UP TO FOUR PLAYERS CAN COMPETE IN THE RACES, BUT IN ORDER TO PLAY NEW TRACKS, THEY MUST FIRST BE UNLOCKED IN THE SINGLE PLAYER GAME.  THERE ARE ALSO FOUR BATTLE MODES OF PLAY - TWO STANDARD DEATHMATCH MAPS, A CAPTURE-THE-FLAG STYLE BATTLE WHERE YOU MUST NAB EGGS AND HATCH THREE OF THEM IN YOUR HOME NEST, AND ANOTHER WHERE YOU MUST BE THE FIRST TO RETURN TEN BANANAS TO YOUR TREASURE CHEST (WITH THE LIMITATION OF ONLY BEING ABLE TO HOLD TWO AT ANY ONE TIME).</desc>

WEAPONS: NEW WEAPONS INCLUDE TWO SUB-MACHINE GUNS (ONE IN EACH HAND), THE EXPANDER (THE BAD GUYS JUST GO POP!) A PLASMA CANNON (WHICH IS CHARGEABLE) AND A GRENADE LAUNCHER. SADLY, THERE ARE A FEW MISSING FROM THE ORIGINAL PC VERSION, INCLUDING THE RIPPER CHAINGUN, THE DEVASTATOR, AND THE FREEZE-RAY.

PRESENTATION: THE BIGGEST CHANGES COME HERE, AS THERE ARE NEW AREAS TO EXPLORE, SOME IMPROVED ENVIRONMENTS, AND THE SAME WISE CRACKS THAT HAVE MADE DUKE FAMOUS. THERE ARE ALSO SOME JOKES HIDDEN AWAY BASED ON CLASSIC MOVIES (CLOCKWORK ORANGE, 12 MONKEYS, MARS ATTACKS AND APOCALYPSE NOW).

HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN PLENTY OF RESTRICTIONS IN THIS VERSION OF DUKE 3D. NINTENDO HAVE REPLACED SOME AREAS (THE PORN MAG SHOP HAS TURNED INTO A GUN STORE, THE BAR IS NOW A BURGER JOINT, AND THE NUDE WOMEN AREN'T NUDE ANYMORE), AND THERE IS AN OPTION AVAILABLE TO TURN THE BLOOD OFF.

A 4 PLAYER MODE HAS ALSO BEEN INCLUDED, WHERE YOU CAN TAKE ON YOUR MATES AS WELL AS DUKE BOTS, AND A 2 PLAYER CO-OP MODE, SO TWO PLAYERS CAN TACKLE THE SINGLE PLAYER MISSIONS.</desc>

		<desc>FAMED SNES RACER F-ZERO GOT THIS N64 UPDATE. GAMEPLAY REMAINS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED, RACE IN A FUTURISTIC RACING TOURNAMENT ON TRACKS LEVITATED MILES UP IN THE AIR, AGAINST A SELECTION OF DEVIOUS OPPONENTS.

WHERE THE ORIGINAL HAD 4 CARS TO CHOOSE FROM AND RACE AGAINST, F-ZERO X HAS NO FEWER THAN 30 VEHICLES ALL WITH THEIR OWN UNIQUE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES, A CHOICE OF COLOURS, AND CUSTOMISABLE POWER/ACCELERATION RATIOS FOR EACH TRACK. AT THE BEGINNING YOU ARE LIMITED TO CHOOSING FROM 6 CARS AND 3 TOURNAMENTS (EACH FEATURING 6 TRACKS EACH), BUT IN TRUE NINTENDO FASHION, MORE CARS AND TRACKS ARE UNLOCKED AS YOU PROGRESS THROUGH THE GAME. AS WELL AS THE CUPS, YOU CAN ALSO RACE IN TIME TRIAL MODE, AGAINST A 'GHOST CAR' RECORDING OF YOUR BEST PREVIOUS LAP, A LÁ MARIO KART 64.

GONE ARE THE ENTIRELY FLAT TRACKS OF THE ORIGINAL, HAVING BEEN REPLACED WITH TRACKS THAT TWIST, TURN, LOOP, ROTATE AND BASICALLY CONTORT INTO THE MOST CRAZY SHAPES YOU COULD IMAGINE. ONE UNIQUE FEATURE AMONGST ALMOST ALL OTHER RACING GAMES IS THE "X" TOURNAMENT, WHERE COURSES ARE TOTALLY RANDOMLY GENERATED EACH TIME YOU START.

ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE FORMAT IS THE INCLUSION OF MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT FOR UP TO 4 PLAYERS. THE VARIOUS COMBAT MOVES ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AGAINST AGGRESSIVE HUMAN PLAY.

THIS GAME HAS A  ROCK SOUNDTRACK, WHICH I BELIEVE IS THE FIRST GAME SOUNDTRACK EVER TO FEATURE THE BESTIAL GRUNTING FOUND ONLY IN DEATH METAL MUSIC.</desc>

		<name>Jet Force Gemini</name>
		<desc>TWINS JUNO AND VELA, AND THEIR DOG LUPUS, ARE JET FORCE GEMINI, INTERGALACTIC POLICE.  THEIR MISSION?  STOP THE EVIL SPACE BUG, MIZAR, FROM HIS GOAL OF GALACTIC CONQUEST WITH HIS SEEMINGLY-INFINITE ARMY OF DRONES.  THEY'LL HAVE TO STOP ALONG MULTIPLE PLANETS ALONG THE WAY, AND ASSISTING KING JEFF AND RESCUING HIS SUBJECTS, THE TRIBALS.

JET FORCE GEMINI IS A THIRD-PERSON SHOOTER WHICH REVELS IN MAKING GIGANTIC CREEPY BUGS EXPLODE INTO DRIBBLY MUCOUSY BITS.  THE JET FORCE TEAM ARE GIVEN PROGRESSIVELY MORE POWERFUL WEAPONS, FROM THE MACHINE GUN, WHICH RIPS THROUGH BOTH ENEMIES AND AMMO, THE PLASMA SHOTGUN, WHICH YOU CAN CHARGE UP FOR SOME EXPLOSIVE FIREWORKS, AND THE TRI-ROCKET LAUNCHER, WHICH FIRES THREE ROCKETS WITH EVERY SHOT, SENDING EXPLOSIVE DOOM IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR TARGET.  THERE'S ALSO THE FISH FOOD, WHICH IS USED TO...ER, FEED FISH.  REALLY.

EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE CALLED DRONES, THESE BUGS AREN'T STUPID.  WHEN ENCOUNTERED, THEY'LL RUSH YOU, HIDE BEHIND OBJECTS FOR COVER, AND EVEN RUN OFF FOR REINFORCEMENTS WHEN YOU CONFRONT THEM.  THEY ALSO TAKE DELIGHT IN SHOOTING THE INNOCENT TRIBALS, WHOM YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE RESCUING.  BUT THE DRONES ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO THE GAME'S INSANELY DIFFICULT BOSSES, WHICH INCLUDES A PAIR OF GIGANTIC PRAYING MANTIS, A HUGE BEETLE, AND OF COURSE, MIZAR HIMSELF, TO NAME BUT A FEW.

EACH OF THEIR TEAM HAS THEIR OWN SPECIAL ABILITIES - JUNO CAN WALK THROUGH LAVA WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE, VELA CAN SWIM UNDERWATER, AND LUPUS CAN HOVER FOR SHORT DISTANCES AND TRAVEL THROUGH TIGHT SPACES.  THESE ABILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO FULLY ACCESS AREAS THAT THEY PREVIOUSLY COULDN'T REACH.  THE TEAM ALSO GET THE HELP OF FLOYD THE DROID, A HOVERING ROBOT THAT CAN BE CONTROLLED BY PLAYER TWO AS A FLOATING GUN WITH INFINITE AMMO WHEN HE JOINS YOUR TEAM.

THE GAME ALSO INCLUDES THREE DIFFERENT MULTIPLAYER MODES: BATTLE - FEATURING MOST OPTIONS OF AN AVERAGE FIRST PERSON SHOOTER BUT WITH A THIRD-PERSON PERSPECTIVE, TARGET SHOOT - A SHOOTING GALLERY WITH A FIRST-PERSON VIEW, AND RACING, WHICH INCLUDES SOME KART-LIKE RACING AS WELL AS OLD-SCHOOL TOP DOWN RACING GAMES.</desc>

		<desc>MARIO KART 64 RACES EIGHT FAMILIAR FACES, INCLUDING MARIO, BOWSER AND YOSHI, ON FOUR PROGRESSIVELY TOUGHER FOUR-TRACK CIRCUITS. WIDE CURVES AND GENTLE BANKS MARK THE MUSHROOM CUP TRACKS. YOUR COMMUTE GETS NOTABLY TOUGHER ON THE FLOWER CUP, THOUGH. THE PLAYER WILL HAVE TO DODGE SEMIS RUMBLING ON TOAD'S TURNPIKE AND BOUNDING BOULDERS ON FOGBOUND CHOCO MOUNTAIN! STAR CUP TRACKS RANGE FROM THE ICY SURFACES OF SHERBET LAND TO THE LAVA LAKES OF BOWSER'S CASTLE. THE TRUE TEST OF KARTING COMPETENCE, THOUGH, COMES ON THE FOUR TRACKS IN SPECIAL CUP. ZIP THROUGH THE DARK CAVES AND GREEN HILLSIDES OF DONKEY KONG'S JUNGLE PARKWAY, CLING TO THE SHEER CLIFFS OF YOSHI VALLEY AND HUSTLE OVER HAUNTED BANSHEE BOARDWALK BEFORE TACKLING THE LONGEST TRACK IN THE GAME: NEON-LIT RAINBOW ROAD. 

THE GAME OFFERS TWO CAMERA ANGLES AND THREE ENGINE SIZES: 50CC, 100CC AND 150CC. YOU CAN GAIN EVEN MORE SPEED BY MASTERING THE POWER SLIDE TECHNIQUE OR GRABBING SUPER STAR POWER-UPS. EACH KART HAS DISTINCTIVE HANDLING, ACCELERATION AND TOP SPEED CAPABILITIES. LIGHT KARTS LIKE PRINCESS'S SMOOTHLY STEER THROUGH TIGHT CORNERS, BUT RUN THE CONSTANT RISK OF GETTING FLATTENED BY HEAVY KARTS, LIKE DONKEY KONG'S. SHELLS THAT YOU FIRE AT RIVAL RACERS, BANANAS THAT MAKE THEM SKID OUT AND LIGHTNING BOLTS THAT MAKE THEM SMALL AND VERY SLOW ARE JUST A FEW OF THE GAME'S UNIQUE POWER-UPS.</desc>

THE SECOND EDITION INCLUDES 5 NEW BOARDS, EACH WITH A SPECIFIC THEME, SUCH AS SPACE LAND, WESTERN LAND, HORROR LAND, AND MYSTERY LAND. EACH BOARD INCLUDES UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES IN RELATION TO THE THEME, BUT THE MAIN GOAL IS THE SAME: COMPLETE THE BOARD GAME OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MOVES AND BE THE PLAYER TO HAVE THE MOST COINS AND/OR STARS AT THE END. 

THE SINGLE PLAYER STORY MODE ALLOWS ONE PERSON AND 3 CPU CONTROLLED PLAYERS TO PLAY EACH BOARD. ONCE YOU PLAY A SPECIFIC MINI-GAME (64 IN ALL), THEY BECOME AVAILABLE TO PURCHASE USING THE COINS YOU COLLECTED IN YOUR GAMES TO PLAY ANYTIME. MULTIPLAYER ALLOWS 2 TO 4 PEOPLE TO PLAY THE GAME.</desc>

IN BATTLE ROYALE MODE (FOUR PLAYER), YOU RACE AROUND DIFFERENT BOARDS TO EARN THE MOST STARS AND COINS.  AT THE END OF EACH ROUND, YOU FACE IT OFF IN ONE OF THE MINI-GAMES, WHICH CAN BE CHICKEN CHASES, SNOWBALL FIGHTS, OR VARIOUS OTHER COMPETITIONS.

DUEL MODE ALLOWS PLAY BETWEEN JUST TWO PEOPLE.  YOU STILL RACE AROUND THE BOARD, BUT MINI-GAMES ARE ONLY PLAYED WHEN YOU LAND ON A SPECIFIC SQUARE.  ANOTHER PLAY CHANGE IS THE ADDITION OF ANOTHER CHARACTER FOR YOUR TEAM, ALLOWING TAG TEAM-STYLE ACTION IN THE GAME.

STORY MODE IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS A BATTLE ROYALE, EXCEPT YOUR OPPONENTS ARE PLAYED BY THE COMPUTER.</desc>

		<desc>YOU KNOW MARIO CAN JUMP. YOU KNOW HE CAN KICK BOWSER'S TAIL FROM HERE TO THE MOON, BUT WE BET YOU DIDN'T REALIZE THAT MARIO IS THE BIGGEST PARTY ANIMAL ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. NINTENDO IS THROWING THE MOST INSANE BASH TO EVER HIT THE N64, AND YOU'RE INVITED. FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU'LL CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HOW MARIO CELEBRATES ALL OF THE VICTORIES HE'S HAD OVER THE YEARS. 

MARIO PARTY IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER GAME FOR THE N64, AND IT JUST MIGHT BE THE BEST PARTY GAME TO EVER HIT THE SYSTEM. MARIO PARTY IS DESIGNED FOR 1 TO 4 PLAYERS, BUT IT'S NOT REALLY A PARTY UNLESS YOU'RE PLAYING WITH YOUR PALS. THE FESTIVITIES ARE BASED ON A BOARD GAME FORMAT, RIGHT DOWN TO THE FACT THAT PLAYERS MUST ROLL A DIE TO DETERMINE HOW MANY SPACES TO MOVE. THE FUN STARTS WHEN PLAYERS LAND ON DIFFERENT SQUARES, BECAUSE EACH SPACE HOLDS ONE OF MORE THAN FIFTY DIFFERENT MINI-GAMES. THESE QUICK COMPETITIONS DETERMINE WHO WILL EARN COINS AND STARS, AND WHO WILL GO HOME EMPTY HANDED. 

 THE MINI-GAMES ARE SPREAD OVER EIGHT DIFFERENT GAME BOARDS, ALL OF WHICH ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE. SOME OF THE GAMES PIT EVERY MAN OR PRINCESS AGAINST THE OTHERS, SOME ARE TWO-ON-TWO, AND OTHERS ARE EVEN THREE AGAINST ONE. THE GAMES ARE SIMPLE, BUT REMARKABLY FUN TO PLAY. ONE CHALLENGE IS LOOSELY BASED ON "SIMON SAYS," ANOTHER INVOLVES A TWO-ON-TWO BOBSLED RACE, AND ONE CRAZY GAME MAKES ONE PLAYER ATTEMPT TO CROSS A ROPE WHILE THE OTHER THREE DO THEIR BEST TO SHAKE THE PLAYER OFF. YOU'LL FIND SKILL GAMES, RACING GAMES, PUZZLE GAMES --BASICALLY ANY TYPE OF CHALLENGE YOU COULD IMAGINE. 

A GOOD PORTION OF THE ACTUAL GAME BOARDS ARE ANIMATED, WITH HIDDEN DANGERS AND SPECIAL CHALLENGES SCATTERED EVERYWHERE. MARIO, LUIGI, PRINCESS PEACH, DONKEY KONG, BOWSER, YOSHI, AND WARIO ARE ALL INVITED TO THE PARTY, AND EACH CHARACTER HAS HIS OR HER OWN GAME BOARD. 

MARIO PARTY IS FUN FOR ONLY ONE PLAYER, BUT TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THIS PARTY-IN-A-PAK, YOU SHOULD PLAY WITH THREE OTHER FRIENDS. IT'S DEFINITELY THE KIND OF GAME THAT WILL KEEP YOU UP TILL THE WEE HOURS OF THE MORNING, SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO START CATCHING UP ON YOUR SLEEP RIGHT AWAY.</desc>

		<desc>THE WEASELS HAVE KIDNAPPED PLUTO WHILE HE WAS WEARING HIS DIAMOND COLLAR!  ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF HIM WAS A RANSOM NOTE SHOWING THE WEASELS DRIVING HIM AWAY IN A VAN.  MICKEY ROUNDS UP ALL OF HIS FRIENDS (AND EVEN PETE WANTS TO GET IN ON THE ACTION!), AND PROFESSOR VON DRAKE SOUPS UP THEIR RACE CARS SO THAT THEY CAN CATCH UP WITH THE WEASELS AS THEY GO ON A CROSS-COUNTRY TOUR OF THE UNITED STATES.  THE WEASELS HAVE ALSO STOLEN FOUR PARTS OF THE PROFESSOR'S TOP-SECRET RACER, AND HIDDEN THEM IN FOUR OF THE TRACKS.  ONCE PLAYERS FIND ALL THESE PIECES, THEY CAN CATCH UP WITH THE WEASELS IN THE FINAL SHOWDOWN.

MICKEY'S SPEEDWAY USA IS A KART RACER FROM RARE BASED ON THE DIDDY KONG RACING GAME ENGINE.  PLAYERS COMPETE IN CIRCUITS OF FOUR RACES, GRAND PRIX STYLE, AND THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST POINTS AT THE END OF ALL FOUR RACES WINS THE GOLD TROPHY.  THERE ARE SIX INITIAL RACERS, BUT ONLY THREE SETS OF STATS SHARED BETWEEN THEM.  MINNIE AND DAISY ARE LIGHTWEIGHT AND GOOD FOR BEGINNERS, MICKEY AND DONALD ARE BOTH ALL-AROUND CHARACTERS, WHILE PETE AND GOOFY ARE THE SLOW BUT FAST HEAVYWEIGHTS.

THE GAME HAS AN ASSORTMENT OF PICKUPS - THERE'S THE CARBO SPRITZER, A SODA-POWERED TURBO; THE PAINT SPLOTCHER, WHICH LAUNCHES A SLIPPERY BLOB OF PAINT ONTO THE TRACK; THE BASEBALL CHUCKER, WHICH LAUNCHES AN EXPLOSIVE BASEBALL ONTO THE TRACK; AND THE MAGNO FLYER, WHICH SENDS A REMOTE CONTROL PLANE TO SEEK THE NEAREST OPPONENT, TO NAME A FEW.  THERE ARE ALSO 'OOMPH TOKENS' SCATTERED ON THE TRACK - THE FIRST TEN OF THESE TOKENS INCREASE YOUR RACER'S MAXIMUM SPEED A LITTLE.

AS WELL AS THE MAIN GAME, MICKEY'S SPEEDWAY USA ALSO FEATURES A TIME TRIAL MODE (WHERE YOU RACE AGAINST THE CLOCK), A PRACTICE MODE (WHERE YOU CAN DRIVE ALL AROUND A FARMYARD COURSE TO PRACTICE YOUR SKILLS), AND CONTEST MODE (WHICH FUNCTIONS LIKE THE FAMOUS BATTLE MODE IN MARIO KART 64 - PLAYERS MUST POP THEIR OPPONENTS' THREE BALLOONS BEFORE THEY LOSE ALL OF THEIR OWN).  THE GAME IS ALSO TRANSFER PAK COMPATIBLE WITH THE GAME BOY COLOR VERSION OF MICKEY'S SPEEDWAY USA.</desc>

		<desc>IN A SURPRISING TWIST OF FATE, MIDWAY MADE A MORTAL KOMBAT GAME THAT FOCUSES ON PERHAPS THE SERIES STRONGEST POINT WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER FIGHTING GAMES: IT'S STORYLINE. THE GAME CASTS YOU IN THE SHOES OF SUB-ZERO, AND CHRONICLES A SERIES OF EVENTS THAT OCURRED PRIOR TO MORTAL KOMBAT 1.

IN A STORYLINE THAT IS REMINISCENT OF LOOKING GLASS'S THIEF, THE LIN KUEI ASSASSIN/THIEF IS SENT TO STEAL AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENT; THIS MISSION PROVES TO BE A TEST FROM A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER (WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE MK4'S QUAN CHI) AND WHO CHARGES YOU UPON RETRIEVAL OF THIS OBJECT TO RECOVER AN ANCIENT MEDALLION OF UNTOLD POWER. HOWEVER ONCE YOU RETRIEVE THE MEDALLION, QUAN CHI REVEALS THAT HE ACTUALLY TRICKED YOU, AND THE MEDALLION IS THE KEY TO AWAKENING THE DEMONIC SHINNOK (YUP, THE SAME BADDIE FROM MK4). YOU MUST NOW BECOME A RELUCTANT HERO, AS YOU PURSUE QUAN CHI TROUGH HELL ITSELF HOPING YOU GET TO SHINNOK BEFORE HIM.

GAMEPLAY WISE THE GAME TAKES THE MORTAL KOMBAT FAMILIAR 2D FIGHTING ENVIROMENT AND TURNS IT INTO A HYBRID FIGHTER/PLATFORMER GAME, WHERE YOU MUST TRAVEL TROUGH HAZARDOUS LEVELS RUNNING AND JUMPING AROUND AS WELL AS FIGHTING YOUR WAY AGAINST BOTH DIGITIZED AND POLYGONAL ENEMIES. SUB-ZERO'S INTERFACE IS THE SAME AS IN EVERY MK GAME, WITH THE ADDITION OF A "USE" AND "TURN AROUND" BUTTONS AND ADDITIONS SUCH AS AN INVENTORY, AND A SLIGHT RPG TWIST IN WHICH YOU GET EXP. FOR DEFEATING OPPONENTS, WHICH TRANSLATES INTO NEW TECHNIQUES AND MOVES TO EXECUTE IN THE GAME.

TECHNICALLY SPEAKING THIS GAME REPRESENTS THE FINAL EVOLUTIONARY STEP IN THE MK'S SERIES 2D ENGINES. NEW FEATURES INCLUDE ZOOMING, 3D LIGHTING AS WELL AS 3D BACKGROUNDS AND CHARACTERS, ETC.</desc>

		<desc>THE PEOPLE OF OEDO TOWN ARE IN A PANIC!  A GIGANTIC UFO SHAPED LIKE A PEACH HAS ARRIVED, AND THE PEACH MOUNTAIN SHOGUNS HAVE TURNED OEDO CASTLE INTO ONE BIG STAGE FOR THEMSELVES TO PERFORM ON!  EVERYONE'S RELYING ON GOEMON TO SAVE THE DAY, BUT HE HASN'T EVEN NOTICED WHAT'S HAPPENING!  CAN OUR HERO STOP THE SHOGUNS BEFORE THEY DO ANY MORE DAMAGE?

MYSTICAL NINJA STARRING GOEMON IS AN ACTION-BASED RPG SIMILAR IN STYLE TO THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: THE OCARINA OF TIME.  IT IS ALSO THE FIRST LOCALIZED GOEMON GAME SINCE THE LEGEND OF THE MYSTICAL NINJA FOR THE SNES.  PLAYERS CONTROL GOEMON AND HIS FRIENDS AS THEY MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH ANCIENT JAPAN TO STOP THE PEACH MOUNTAIN SHOGUNS.  YOU CAN TALK TO CHARACTERS, WHACK ENEMIES WITH YOUR PIPE (OR HURL COINS AT THEM), VISIT A DERANGED FORTUNE TELLER WHO SHRIEKS OUT "PLASMA!" AT RANDOM INTERVALS FOR NO REASON, AND MORE.

EACH MEMBER OF THE GOEMON TEAM CAN ALSO LEARN A SPECIAL ABILITY TO ACCESS NEW AREAS AS PLAYERS PROGRESS THROUGH THE GAME.  GOEMON EARNS THE "SUDDEN IMPACT" POWER, WHICH LETS HIM MOVE BLOCKS HE NORMALLY COULDN'T, EBISUMARU CAN SHRINK TO SMALL SIZES SO HE CAN PASS THROUGH TINY CRACKS, SASUKE EARNS AN EXTRA HIGH JUMP, AND YAE GETS THE ABILITY TO TRANSFORM INTO A MERMAID SO THAT SHE CAN SWIM UNDERWATER.

AS USUAL, THE GIGANTIC ROLLER-SKATING ROBOT, IMPACT, MAKES AN APPEARANCE.  PLAYERS GET TO USE HIM TO TRAMPLE DOWN BUILDINGS AND DUKE IT OUT IN FIRST-PERSON MODE AGAINST GIGANTIC MECHA BOSS CHARACTERS IN A PUNCH-OUT!! STYLE GAME.</desc>

CHEERLEADERS IN, WELL, CHEERLEADING UNIFORMS LIVEN UP THE END OF THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTER AND THERE'S ENOUGH STATS TO MAKE THE MATHEMATICALLY INCLINED HAPPY. HOWEVER, THE TEAMS FEATURES ARE NOT ENTIRELY BASED ON REAL LIFE (INDY WAS AT THE TOP), AND IT IS NOT AS ADDICTIVE AS THE OLD-FASHIONED PC GAMES OF THE EARLY 1990'S, BUT STILL A GOOD GAME FOR SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T MIND NOT-SO-CLASSIC, ALMOST XFL STYLE FOOTBALL.</desc>

		<desc>AFTER THE AWARD-WINNING NHL 98, EA WORKED TO IMPROVE WHAT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE THE MOST COMPLETE ICE HOCKEY GAMES IN THE MARKET. ALONG THE USUAL AND ALMOST OBLIGATORY NHL ROSTER UPDATES, THE INTERNATIONAL MODE FIRST FEATURED IN THE PREVIOUS VERSION WAS EXPANDED, ALLOWING PLAYERS TO CHOOSE IIHF RULES AND RINK SIZE.

GRAPHICALLY, THE ARENA IS MORE DETAILED WITH MORE RINKSIDE FEATURES, AND ICE REFLECTIONS, PLAYER FACES WERE IMPROVED AND STAND MORE SEAMLESSLY INTO THE MODEL, ENHANCED MOTION CAPTURE RESULT IN BETTER ANIMATED HITS (WITH THE ABILITY TO BREAK THE GLASS WITH A WELL-PLACED BODY CHECK MAKING A RETURN), SHOTS AND SAVES, AND FINALLY AN HIGHER POLYGON COUNT COMPLETE THE GRAPHIC ENHANCEMENTS TO THE GAME.

AS GRAPHIC CHANGES AREN'T ENOUGH TO MAKE A GAME BETTER, GAMEPLAY WAS ALSO TWEAKED, WITH COMPUTER PLAYERS BEING SMARTER, BOTH IN OFFENSE AND DEFENSE. SHOOTING WAS TWEAKED (SLAP SHOTS ARE EASIER TO PULL, PLAYERS NO LONGER SKATE IN CIRCLES TO DO SOME BACKHAND SHOTS AND MUST BE FACING THE GOAL TO SHOOT, PARTICULARLY IN ONE TIMERS) AND A NEW SPECIAL MOVE BRINGS DEKES, SPIN-O-RAMAS AND THE KIND OF MOVES JAGR, FEDOROV AND SELÄNNE PULL WHEN ONE-ON-ONE WITH THE GOALIE. HOWEVER, IF THE PLAYER GETS TOO CLOSE TO THE CREASE, THE REFEREE MIGHT WANT TO REVIEW THE PLAY IN THE NEW VIDEO GOAL JUDGE, SO THE PLAYER MUST THINK TWICE BEFORE TRYING TO PULL A "BRETT HULL". FOR NEWCOMERS TO THE SPORT, A NEW BEGINNER MODE ALLOWS PLAYERS TO GET USED TO THE ICE WITHOUT HAVING TO CONCERN WITH PENALTIES OR AN OVERLY STRONG OPPONENT.

THE SEASON MODE WAS ALSO IMPROVED, WITH THE PLAYERS NOW HAVING STREAKS THAT AFFECT EITHER POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY HIS ABILITIES. DEBUTING THE NASHVILLE PREDATORS, PLAYERS CAN EITHER CHOOSE TO PLAY WITH THEIR INITIAL ROSTER, OR DO A FANTASY EXPANSION DRAFT.

LIKE IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR, JIM HUGHSON AND DARRYL REAUGH LIVEN UP MATCHES WITH PLAY BY PLAY AND COLOUR COMMENTARY.</desc>

		<name>Penny Racers</name>
		<desc>PENNY RACERS IS A RACING GAME WITH CARTOONISH, MADE-OF-PAPER-LIKE CARS. THERE ARE THIRTEEN CARS WHICH YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM AND NINE TRACKS IN TOTAL  ALL AVAILABLE RIGHT FROM THE START. IT FEATURES TWO PLAYABLE MODES, RACE SERIES AND TIME TRIAL, AND A MODE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE YOUR OWN TRACK. THE GAME ALSO SUPPORTS UP TO FOUR HUMAN PLAYERS. 

IN RACE SERIES YOU CAN SELECT ONE OF THE THIRTEEN CARS AND RACE IN ANY OF THE NINE TRACKS WITH FIVE MORE COMPETITORS. YOU CAN ONLY COMPETE IN CLASS C (LOWER DIFFICULTY) RACES AT FIRST BUT CAN UNLOCK MORE IF YOU FINISH WITHIN THE FIRST THREE POSITIONS. AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH RACE YOU ARE GIVEN THE OPTION TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR CARS PARTS  PARTS LIKE THE CARS BODY, ENGINE, TIRES, ETC.  BUT ONLY IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE IN STOCK FOR EACH CATEGORY. NEW PARTS CAN BE TAKEN FROM THE OTHER CARS AT THE END OF EACH RACE BUT ONLY IF YOU ARE AMONG THE FIRST THREE RACERS THAT CROSS THE FINISH LINE. ALSO, EACH PART HAS POINTS AND THE SUM OF THESE POINTS MUST NOT EXCEED THE POINT LIMIT FOR EACH DIFFICULTY. FOR EXAMPLE A BASIC BRAKE PART MAY ADD ONE POINT TO THE TOTAL SUM (BETTER PARTS ADD MORE POINTS). IF WITH ALL THE OTHER PARTS THE SUM OF POINTS EXCEEDS A LETS SAY POINT LIMIT OF SIX THEN YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER THE RACE. THE CURRENT MODE SUPPORTS UP TO TWO HUMAN PLAYERS.

TIME TRIAL IS THE BASIC MODE WHERE YOU RUN AGAINST TIME. YOU CAN ALSO LOAD A PREVIOUSLY SAVED GHOST TO RACE AGAINST.

VS RACE MODE CAN BE ACCESSED ONLY IF THREE OR FOUR HUMAN PLAYERS ARE SELECTED. IT HAS 8 TRACKS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE ONES OF THE OTHER MODES AND THESE TRACKS HAVE MORE OBSTACLES. 

NEW TRACK LETS YOU CREATE YOUR OWN CUSTOM MADE TRACK. YOU CAN SELECT THE ROAD TYPE (ON ROAD/OFF ROAD) AND TRACK TYPE (CIRCUIT/STAGE). AFTER THE BASIC LAYOUT IS SELECTED YOU ARE TAKEN ON THE MAP WHERE YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM THE AVAILABLE LAYERS TO MAKE THE TRACK. YOU CAN ALSO ADJUST THE ROADS HEIGHT.</desc>

THE GRAPHICS ARE MUCH MORE DETAILED AND COLORFUL, AS YOU'D EXPECT CONSIDERING THE INTERVENING YEARS OF ADVANCES IN PROGRAMMING SKILL.

THE CONTROL SYSTEM IS THE STANDARD THREE-CLICK METHOD USED IN MOST GOLF GAMES, BUT YOU CAN NOW DEFINE INTENDED DRAW/FADE LEVELS IN ADVANCE OF PLAYING THE SHOT, SO THAT A PERFECT AIM LEADS TO A MEASURED EFFECT, AND AN IMPERFECT ONE EXAGGERATING THE EFFECT.

AS WELL AS THE STROKE PLAY GAMES OF THE ORIGINAL (WHERE YOU COUNT THE TOTAL SCORE ACROSS THE WHOLE ROUND OF 18 HOLES, AND COMPARE THIS TO YOUR OPPONENT), THERE ARE ALSO MATCH PLAY (WHERE THE AIM IS TO WIN AS MANY INDIVIDUAL HOLES AS POSSIBLE) AND SKINS (THE SAME, BUT WITH MONEY) MODES AS WELL.</desc>

		<name>Quake</name>
		<desc>AN ENEMY WITH THE CODENAME ''QUAKE'', WHICH IS BELIEVED TO COME FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION, IS USING TELEPORTER GATES TO INVADE EARTH. THE PLAYER TAKES THE ROLE OF A NAMELESS SOLDIER WHO ARRIVES AT HIS BASE ONLY TO FIND OUT QUAKE HAS OVERRUN IT AND KILLED EVERYONE. SOMEWHERE IN THE BASE THERE MUST BE A TELEPORTER TO QUAKE'S REALM. THE MISSION IS CLEAR: TAKE THE FIGHT TO THE ENEMY, OVERCOMING COUNTLESS HORDES OF MONSTERS, AND EXACT REVENGE.

ID SOFTWARE'S FOLLOWUP TO DOOM AND DOOM II, "QUAKE" IS A FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER. ITS MAIN TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IS THE USE OF A TRUE 3D ENGINE - THE LEVELS THEMSELVES AS WELL AS THE ENEMIES ARE POLYGONAL. THIS NOT ONLY ALLOWS FOR MORE NATURAL LEVEL DESIGNS AND CHARACTER ANIMATIONS, BUT ALSO FOR MORE REALISTIC LIGHTING AND THE INCLUSION OF SIMULATED PHYSICS THAT HAVE AN EFFECT ON GAMEPLAY: GRENADES CAN BOUNCE OFF WALLS AND AROUND CORNERS, FOR EXAMPLE.

IN SINGLE-PLAYER MODE, GAMEPLAY CONSISTS MAINLY OF PROCEEDING THROUGH THE LEVELS (SPREAD OVER FOUR DISTINCT EPISODES) IN SEARCH OF AN EXIT, KILLING EVERYTHING THAT MOVES. INTERACTION WITH THE GAME WORLD IS REDUCED TO A MINIMUM: SINCE THERE IS NO USE KEY, BUTTONS ARE PRESSED BY RUNNING INTO OR SHOOTING AT THEM. AS IN ID'S EARLIER GAMES, MANY SECRETS ARE WAITING TO BE DISCOVERED, INCLUDING A FEW HIDDEN LEVELS.

UNLIKE DOOM'S RATHER STRAIGHTFORWARD DESIGN THAT COUPLES FUTURISTIC ENVIRONMENTS WITH DEMONIC IMAGERY, THE THEME OF QUAKE'S LEVELS, ENEMIES AND WEAPONS IS NOT SO EASILY PINPOINTED. WHILE EACH EPISODE BEGINS IN A FUTURISTIC MILITARY BASE (WITH A TECHNOLOGICAL 'SLIPGATE' AS THE LEVEL EXIT), LATER LEVELS TAKE PLACE IN ENVIRONMENTS INSPIRED BY MEDIEVAL FANTASY AND GOTHIC HORROR (CASTLES, DUNGEONS AND CAVERNS) AND THE PLAYER PASSES THROUGH MAGICAL PORTALS TO ADVANCE. IN A DEPARTURE FROM DOOM'S COLORFUL ENVIRONMENTS, ALL QUAKE LEVELS ARE DOMINATED BY EARTH COLORS.

THE ENEMIES CONFORM TO THE MISHMASH OF DESIGNS: THERE ARE HUMAN OPPONENTS ARMED WITH SHOTGUNS AND ENERGY WEAPONS IN THE EARLY LEVELS, WHILE THE LATER LEVELS INCLUDE MEDIEVAL KNIGHTS, GHOSTS, ZOMBIES, OGRES (ARMED WITH GRENADE LAUNCHERS AND CHAINSAWS) AND SOME MORE UNEARTHLY BEASTS. THE PLAYER'S WEAPONS, WHILE RELATIVELY MODERN, ALL HAVE A LOW-TECH FEEL.  BESIDES A (BLOODSTAINED) AXE, THERE ARE SHOTGUNS, NAILGUNS, ROCKET AND GRENADE LAUNCHERS AND THE THUNDERBOLT, WHICH DISCHARGES ELECTRICAL ENERGY.

QUAKE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST GAMES PLAYABLE NATIVELY OVER THE INTERNET IN ADDITION TO LANS. THE SINGLE-PLAYER LEVELS CAN BE PLAYED COOPERATIVELY, BUT THE GAME IS MOST FAMOUS FOR ITS DEATHMATCH MODE. ONE-ON-ONE DUELS, TEAM PLAY AND FREE-FOR-ALL COMPETITION ARE POSSIBLE. THE EMPHASIS IS ON FAST REACTION AND SKILLFUL MANEUVERING THROUGH THE LEVELS. ALL OF THE SINGLE-PLAYER MAPS CAN BE USED AS ARENAS, BUT THE GAME ALSO COMES WITH SIX MAPS ESPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR DEATHMATCH.</desc>

		<name>Re-Volt</name>
		<desc>FOR YEARS, THE TOY-VOLT COMPANY HAS BEEN PRODUCING TOYS AND GAMES FOR CHILDREN ALL OVER THE WORLD. WITHIN MONTHS OF INTRODUCING THEIR FIRST PRODUCTS, TOY-VOLT SHOT TO THE TOP! NO ONE COULD PUT THEIR FINGER ON EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS THAT MADE THE TOYS SO POPULAR. SURE, THEY EMPLOYED THE BEST DESIGNERS AND MARKETERS IN THE WORLD, BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT TOY-VOLT TOYS, SOMETHING ALMOST.... MAGIC. NOW, THEIR NEWEST R/C CARS REALLY START TO LIVE! 

RE-VOLT IS A RACING GAME WHERE YOU TAKE CONTROL OVER ONE OF MORE THAN 28 R/C CARS AND DRIVE ON ONE OF THE 13 TRACKS. THE TRACKS ARE VARIED, AND INCLUDE A TOY SHOP, A SUPERMARKET, A LUXURY LINER AND MORE. IT IS POSSIBLE TO PLAY A "REVERSED" (BACKWARDS) OR "MIRROR" (REVERSED LEFT AND RIGHT) VARIETY OF EACH TRACK. THERE ARE ALSO 4 LEVELS OF REALISM TO CHOOSE FROM. 

THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SINGLE- AND MULTIPLAYER GAME MODES TO CHOOSE FROM. THERE'S A SINGLE RACE, WHERE YOU COMPLETE A SINGLE TRACK WHILE COMPETING WITH SEVERAL COMPUTER-CONTROLLED OPPONENTS; A CHAMPIONSHIP, WHERE YOU TRY TO COMPLETE A SERIES OF RACES IN HOPES OF FINISHING ON THE TOP; AND MULTIPLAYER, WHERE YOU PLAY WITH LIVE OPPONENTS. THERE'S ALSO A TIME TRIAL, WHERE YOU'RE ALONE ON THE TRACK, AND SIMPLY TRY TO GET AS BEST A TIME AS POSSIBLE; A PRACTICE MODE, WHERE YOU'RE FREE TO DRIVE AROUND A TRACK TO LEARN ITS STRUCTURE AND SHORTCUTS; AND THE STUNT ARENA, WHERE YOU DRIVE AROUND A SPECIAL ARENA AND TRY TO COLLECT STARS SITUATED IN HARD-TO-REACH PLACES. 

IN SINGLE RACE, CHAMPIONSHIP AND MULTIPLAYER THERE ARE POWER-UPS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE TRACK; PICKING THEM UP GIVES YOU A ONE-USE RANDOM POWER, SUCH AS MISSILES TO LAUNCH AT PESKY OPPONENTS, A STAR TO TEMPORARILY FREEZE COMPETITORS IN PLACE OR A LIGHTNING BOLT, WHICH MAKES YOUR CAR SHOCK OPPONENTS NEARBY TO MAKE THEM STOP.</desc>

		<name>Snowboard Kids 2</name>
		<desc>THE SEQUEL TO THE FAMOUS SNOWBOARD SIMULATION SNOWBOARD KIDS IS A FUN FAMILY SPORTS GAME. IT COMBINES A TRICK-ORIENTED SNOWBOARD SIMULATOR WITH SHOOTING/ARCADE ELEMENTS. 

PLAYER CAN CHOOSE FROM VARIOUS CHARACTERS WITH DIFFERENT LOOK AND SKILLS. THERE ARE DIFFERENT GAMING MODES, INCLUDING A STORY MODE WITH VERY LIGHT AND ENTERTAINING PLOT. THE STORYLINE IS ACTUALLY QUITE BASIC, SOMETIMES SIMILAR TO THE KIRBY SERIES CONCEPTS. HENCE, THERE IS NO RUSH FOR SAVING THE WORLD, JUST SOME FUNNY LITTLE FELLAS ENTERTAINING THEMSELVES. 

WINNING A RACE OR PERFORMING TRICKS PROVIDES THE PLAYER WITH SOME CREDIT WHICH CAN BE SPENT ON IMPROVED EQUIPMENT. SHOOTING ELEMENTS ARE BASED ON BUT NOT LIMITED TO THROWING STRANGE OBJECTS (LIKE PARACHUTES OR SNOW-MEN) AGAINST OTHER SNOWBOARD KIDS IN ORDER TO SLOW THEM DOWN. THERE ARE GREAT POWER-UPS DURING THE GAMEPLAY. COURSES ARE RARELY COVERED WITH SNOW - MOST OF THE RACES ARE HELD IN FREAKISH REGIONS LIKE JUNGLES, SPACE STATIONS, CASTLES ETC.</desc>

		<desc>IN 1978, EARTH SUCCESSFULLY REPULSED AN INVASION FROM OUTER SPACE THANKS TO "THE TANK."  THE TANK WAS BASED ON ALIEN TECHNOLOGY FOUND WHEN A SCOUT SHIP HAD CRASHED YEARS EARLIER.  NOW, OVER 20 YEARS LATER, A NEW TANK HAS BEEN CREATED BASED ON THE TECHNOLOGY RECOVERED DURING THE 1978 INVASION.  AND NONE TOO SOON, BECAUSE THE INVADERS ARE BACK!

SPACE INVADERS IS YET ANOTHER CLASSIC ARCADE GAME REMAKE BY ACTIVISION.  (SEE BATTLEZONE AND ASTEROIDS.)  BUT THIS TIME, ACTIVISION LICENSED A GAME FROM TAITO INSTEAD OF ATARI.  THE GAME STAYS CLOSE TO ITS ROOTS WHILE ADDING MANY POWER-UPS AND ENEMIES.

YOU CAN PLAY EITHER ONE OR TWO PLAYERS AGAINST THE INVADERS, WHO MARCH DOWN THE SCREEN IN ORDERLY ROWS AND COLUMNS, AT ONE OF THREE SKILL LEVELS.  YOU'LL START AT PLUTO AND WORK YOUR WAY THROUGH THE SOLAR SYSTEM TO MARS, THEN VENUS, AND FINALLY EARTH.  THERE ARE FOUR COMMON ALIENS (RED, GREEN, BLUE, AND YELLOW), PLUS SEVEN MORE LESS COMMON ONES.  YOU RECEIVE SPECIAL ONE SHOT POWER-UPS BY SHOOTING FOUR OF THE SAME TYPE OF INVADERS IN A ROW.  AS IN THE ORIGINAL GAME, THERE ARE ALSO MOTHER SHIPS THAT FLY ABOVE THE ACTION, BUT IN THIS VERSION IF YOU HIT THEM YOU CAN PICK UP OTHER USEFUL POWER-UPS LIKE SHIELDS OR DOUBLE SHOTS.  PLUS, AFTER FIGHTING OFF SEVERAL WAVES ON EACH PLANET, YOU'LL FACE A UNIQUE BOSS.  IF YOU MANAGE TO FINISH THE GAME, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PLAY A REPRODUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL COIN-OP.</desc>

		<name>Space Station Silicon Valley</name>
		<desc>LONG AGO, SCIENTISTS CREATED A LIVING SPACE STATION, FULL OF ANIMALS. AFTER ITS LAUNCH INTO SPACE, THE STATION VANISHED, NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN.

UNTIL NOW.

THE STATION HAS REAPPEARED OUT OF NO-WHERE, MANY YEARS AFTER ITS FIRST LAUNCH, AND IS ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH EARTH. TWO UNLIKELY HEROES (PILOT AND ALL-ROUND UGLY LOOKING GUY DAN AND ROBOT EVO) ARE NOW THRUST WITH THE MISSION TO STOP THE STATION, AND FIND OUT WHERE IT HAS BEEN ALL THIS TIME.

SADLY, NOT EVERYTHING GOES TO PLAN, WITH THEIR SHIP CRASHING INTO THE STATION. EVO, THE UNLUCKY ROBOT THAT HE IS, IS THROWN OUT OF THE SHIP AND SMASHED INTO PIECES. HIS ONLY HOPE FOR SURVIVAL IS TO ATTACH HIS MICROCHIP INTO ANOTHER HOST ROBOT. THANKFULLY, UNDERNEATH THE WRECKED SHIP IS THE REMAINS OF ANOTHER ROBOT, AND WITH A QUICK FIX EVO IS NOW A ROBOTIC DOG.

AS YOU ENTER THE VALLEY, YOU MUST CONTEND WITH A HOST OF OTHER ROBOTS MUCH LIKE THE DOG, OF ALL SHAPES AND ANIMAL SIZES. YOU CAN MOVE EVO'S CHIP FROM ONE ANIMAL TO ANOTHER TO GAIN ATTRIBUTES AND ABILITIES, IMPROVING YOUR CHANCE OF SUCCESS TO GET PAST THE KILLER PENGUINS AND ROCKET LAUNCHING TIGERS.

AIMS OF THE GAME INCLUDE THE BASIC DESTRUCTION OF ENEMY ROBOTS, TO SHEEP HERDING, CONTROLLING EVO THE RAT THROUGH A MINI MAZE, AND PLENTY MORE THROUGH 35 LEVELS OF INSANE 3RD PERSON ACTION.

WHEN THE GAME WAS PORTED TO PLAYSTATION SOME OF THE BUGS FROM THE NINTENDO 64 VERSION WERE FIXED.</desc>

		<name>Spider-Man</name>
		<desc>SPIDER-MAN IS THE FIRST 3D GAME TO STAR THE POPULAR WEB-SLINGER.  IT IS LOOSELY BASED ON SPIDER-MAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES AND SPIDER-MAN UNLIMITED AND FEATURES SOME OF THE VOICE CAST FROM EACH AND SIMILAR CHARACTER DESIGNS.

PETER PARKER IS ATTENDING A DEMONSTRATION OF THE REFORMED DR. OTTO OCTAVIUS'S NEW INVENTION WHEN AN IMPOSTER SPIDER-MAN STEALS THE DEVICE.  SPIDER-MAN MUST WORK TO CLEAR HIS NAME AND UNCOVER THE SINISTER MOTIVES BEHIND THE DEVICE'S THEFT.

THIS GAME FEATURES APPEARANCES NOT ONLY BY MOST MAJOR SPIDER-MAN CHARACTERS, BUT CAMEOS BY NUMEROUS OTHER CHARACTERS FROM THE MARVEL UNIVERSE, SUCH AS THE HUMAN TORCH, PUNISHER, DAREDEVIL AND CAPTAIN AMERICA.

SPIDER-MAN'S WEBS ARE GREATLY EMPHASIZED.  HE CAN USE THEM BOTH FOR NAVIGATIONAL PURPOSES, LIKE SWINGING OR ZIPLINING, AND FOR OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE COMBAT, SUCH AS TYING UP A VILLAIN, COATING HIS FISTS WITH WEB FOR EXTRA OOMPH, OR BUILDING A PROTECTIVE SHIELD.  HIS WEB SUPPLY IS LIMITED THOUGH AND HE MUST FIND NEW CARTRIDGES OR RISK RUNNING OUT.  THE WALL-CRAWLING POWERS ARE ALSO PROMINENTLY FEATURES.  SPIDER-MAN CAN CLING TO ANY WALL OR CEILING.  THIS IS USED FOR BASIC ENVIRONMENTAL NAVIGATION AND FOR STEALTH AS THERE ARE MANY SEQUENCES WHERE YOU CRAWL OVER THE HEADS OF UNSUSPECTING THUGS, OR DROP DOWN AND CATCH THEM OFF-GUARD.

COMBAT IS BASED AROUND SPIDER-MAN'S ABILITY TO JUMP, KICK, PUNCH AND WEB.  BY COMBINING THESE WITH DIRECTION AND IN VARIOUS COMBINATIONS, SPIDER-MAN IS ABLE TO THROW OBJECTS SUCH AS FURNITURE, HURL WEB BALLS, YANK ENEMIES INTO MELEE RANGE AND FOLLOW UP WITH A FLURRY OF HITS, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BOSS-BATTLES AS WELL, ALL OF WHICH ARE PUZZLE-BASED.

MISSIONS VARY FROM THE FAIRLY COMMON FIGHT-YOUR WAY-TO-THE-GOAL OR FIND-THE-KEY-THAT-UNLOCKS-THE-DOOR TYPES TO RACES TO CATCH SOME OR EVADE THEM OR JUST TRYING TO AVOID THE POLICE.

THERE ARE SEVERAL SIDE GOALS IN ADDITION THE MAIN MISSION INCLUDING MULTIPLE UNLOCKABLE SPIDER-MAN COSTUMES AND NUMEROUS HIDDEN COMIC BOOK COVERS TO FIND.</desc>

		<desc>IN THE DISTANT FUTURE, A SMALL GROUP OF HUMAN EXILES HAVE BEEN DOOMED TO FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL ON THE EDGE OF THE GALAXY. THROUGH MILITARY STRENGTH, ESPIONAGE, AND DECEIT, A UNIFIED TERRAN GOVERNMENT HAS MAINTAINED AN UNEASY PEACE. BUT AS RESOURCES AND FUEL RUN SHORT, THE CONFEDERATE NATIONS FIND THEMSELVES LOOKING TOWARDS THE RICH WORLDS OF THEIR ALIEN NEIGHBORS, THE ENIGMATIC PROTOSS. TO FURTHER COMPLICATE MATTERS, IT SEEMS THAT A PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN SPECIES-- THE ZERG-- HAS ENTERED PROTOSS SPACE AND IS DESTROYING EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH. THE TIME FOR WAR HAS COME.

THE N64 PORT OF STARCRAFT IS A REAL-TIME STRATEGY GAME FEATURING THREE DISTINCT RACES - TERRANS, PROTOSS AND ZERG. CONTROLS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED FOR THE GAMEPAD, WITH SEVERAL HOT-KEY MENUS AVAILABLE, AND RESOURCE GATHERING HAS BEEN AUTOMATED TO LIMIT THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF OPTIONS. HOWEVER, IT LACKS THE CUTSCENES AND MAP EDITOR OF THE ORIGINAL GAME.

IF THE PLAYER HAS THE EXPANSION PACK FOR THE N64, THE ENTIRE BROOD WARS EXPANSION IS ALSO AVAILABLE. ONE PLAYER CAN PLAY WITH UP TO 7 BOTS ON A RANDOM MAP, OR 2 PLAYERS CAN TEAM UP IN CO-OPERATIVE MODE (WITH THE N64 EXPANSION PACK) OR GO HEAD TO HEAD WITH UP TO 6 OTHER BOTS FOR TOTAL MAYHEM.</desc>

		<desc>TONY HAWK'S PRO SKATER IS A SKATEBOARDING SIMULATION IN WHICH YOU CONTROL A FAMOUS SKATE STAR AROUND 3D ENVIRONMENTS.  EACH GAME AREA CONTAINS A PLETHORA OF OBJECTS LIKE RAMPS, RAILS, AND HALF-PIPES WHICH CAN BE USED TO PERFORM TRICKS. EACH TRICK YOU PERFORM EARNS YOU MORE POINTS FOR YOUR SCORE.

THE GAME IS DIVIDED INTO TWO TYPES OF LEVELS.  IN THE FIRST, YOU SKATE AROUND LOCATIONS LIKE A MALL, A CITY STREET, OR A WAREHOUSE.  IN EACH OF THESE AREAS, THERE ARE 5 GOALS FOR THE YOU TO COMPLETE.  SOME GOALS INVOLVE OBTAINING A HIGH SCORE, OTHERS SMASHING OBJECTS, AND SOME COLLECTING OBJECTS. FOR EVERY GOAL YOU COMPLETE, YOU EARN A VIDEO TAPE.  BY COLLECTING ENOUGH VIDEO TAPES, YOU UNLOCK LEVELS AND SKATEBOARDS FOR YOU TO USE. THERE ARE 6 LEVELS LIKE THIS. THE SECOND TYPE OF LEVEL IS A COMPETITION. YOU GET TO MAKE 3 TIMED RUNS THROUGH A SKATE PARK, AND ATTEMPT TO GET THE HIGHEST SCORE POSSIBLE.  IF YOU DO WELL ENOUGH, YOU WILL BEAT THE SCORES OF THE COMPUTER CONTROLLED SKATERS AND WIN A MEDAL.  THERE ARE 3 LEVELS LIKE THIS.

THERE ARE NINE REAL LIFE PRO SKATERS YOU CAN CHOOSE TO PLAY AS, INCLUDING TONY HAWK HIMSELF.  EACH SKATER HAS THEIR OWN SIGNATURE MOVES THAT EARN YOU BIG POINTS IF PULLED OFF SUCCESSFULLY.</desc>

ALONG WITH THE NEW OPTION TO JOIN A RALLY RACING TEAM, WHO SUPPORTS YOU THROUGH-OUT EACH CHAMPIONSHIP CUP YOU TAKE PART IN. MONEY RAISED BY EACH VISTORY OR TOP PLACE IN THE CUPS GOES TOWARDS IMPROVING YOUR CAR, OR REPARING ANY PROBLEMS. IF YOU TAKE A WRONG TURN AND DAMAGE A PART OF YOUR CAR (WHICH CAN BE ANYTHING FROM TYRES TO A FULL ENGINE), THE REPAIRS COME OUT OF YOUR POCKET, SO DRIVING CAREFULLY IS IMPORTANT.
NEW SPONSERSHIP DEALS AND BIGGER TEAM CALL UPS WILL ALSO COME INTO PLAY THE BETTER YOU RACE, ALLOWING THE CHANCE TO DRIVE THE MORE POWERFUL RALLY CARS AND PLAY FOR BIG MONEY.

MUCH LIKE THE REAL RALLY CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU DON'T RACE AGAINST OTHER CARS IN THE CUPS. INSTEAD, YOU MUST RACE THE CLOCK. WHOEVER CLOCKS THE BEST TIME FOR EACH STAGE WILL WIN THE POINTS AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STAGE AND THE BIGGER CUP CHALLENGES.

YOU CAN ALSO TAKE PART IN THE USUAL ARCADE RALLY STYLE AGAINST 4 OTHER CARS, WITH THE FIRST TO GET TO THE FINISH TAKING THE POINTS. 2 PLAYERS CAN PLAY AS PART OF ONE TEAM DURING A CHAMPIONSHIP CAMPAIGN, AS WELL UP TO FOUR PLAYERS SPLIT SCREEN IN THE ARCADE MODE.</desc>

		<desc>WAR GODS IS A ONE-ON-ONE FIGHTING GAME THAT TAKES PLACE IN 3D ENVIRONMENTS. THE FIGHTER UNDER YOUR CONTROL CAN PERFORM MANY DIFFERENT MOVES, AND STRING THOSE MOVES TOGETHER TO PERFORM "COMBOS."  FURTHERMORE, THE FIGHTERS ALL HAVE SPECIAL "FINISHING MOVES" THAT ELIMINATE YOUR OPPONENT IN SOME GRUESOME MANNER AT THE END OF A MATCH.  THERE ARE 10 DIFFERENT FIGHTERS TO CHOOSE FROM, ALL BASED ON DIFFERENT ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS.

THE GRAPHICS IN WAR GODS ARE FAIRLY UNIQUE. THEY WERE CREATED BY TEXTURE-MAPPING 3D CHARACTER MODELS WITH DIGITIZED PHOTOS OF PEOPLE.  THIS GIVES THEM A REASONABLY LIFELIKE LOOK.</desc>

FOR THOSE WHO'VE NEVER PLAYED WORMS, IT'S AT HEART SIMILAR TO THE OLD GAME ARTILLERY, WHICH YOU CONTROL AN ARTILLERY PIECE. IN ESSENCE, YOU GIVE IT A SHOT ANGLE AND SHOT POWER, AND TRY TO HIT YOUR ENEMY, DESPITE WIND EFFECTS AND THE ENEMY FIRING BACK AT YOU. WORMS PUTS YOU IN COMMAND OF A TEAM OF WORMS, BUT NOT ONLY CAN YOU MOVE AROUND THE LANDSCAPE, YOU CAN USE MANY TYPES OF WEAPONS TO TRY TO DISPATCH THE ENEMY, FROM BAZOOKAS TO MINI-GUNS TO EXPLODING SHEEP. 

EVERYTHING IS PRESENTED IN A HUMOROUS CARTOONISH STYLE, FROM THE LANDSCAPES TO THE WORMS THEMSELVES AND THEIR CRIES OF TRIUMPH OR DESPAIR, DEPENDING ON HOW YOU DO.

ARMAGEDDON USES AN ENHANCED VERSION OF THE WORMS 2 ENGINE, AND WHILE AN IMPROVEMENT OVER WORMS 2, IT'S NOT A HUGE CHANGE.</desc>

		<name>WWF War Zone</name>
		<desc>ONE OF THE FIRST WRESTLING GAMES FOR THE NINTENDO 64, AND ONE OF THE MANY FOR THE PLAYSTATION. THE PLAYSTATION VERSION HAS BETTER, CD QUALITY MUSIC, BUT HAS LESS FEATURES. ONE OF THE MAIN ATTRACTIONS WAS THAT WWF'S STEVE AUSTIN DID A LOT OF VOICE ACTING FOR IT, ALTHOUGH THE OTHER WRESTLERS DON'T HAVE NEARLY AS MUCH SPEECH.

FEATURES INCLUDE CUSTOM PLAYER MADE WRESTLERS, AS WELL AS THE REAL  WRESTLERS, MANY DIFFERENT GAME TYPES (SINGLE PLAYER, MULTIPLAYER, ROYAL RUMBLES, CAGE MATCHES, ETC.), BUT THE CAREER MODE IS WHERE THE ACTION IS, AND YOU CAN BUILD UP YOUR WRESTLERS STRENGTHS, AND EARN HIM BELTS.</desc>
