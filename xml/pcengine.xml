		<name>Aoi Blink</name>
		<desc>AOI BLINK IS A SIDE-SCROLLING PLATFORMER BASED ON THE TV ANIME SERIES OF THE SAME NAME. THE FIVE LEVELS ARE SIMILARLY BUILT AS THE ONES IN SUPER MARIO BROS. 3: THEY ARE DIVIDED INTO VARIOUS AREAS WHICH ARE REACHED THROUGH A MAP SCREEN WITH BRANCHING PATHS. THOSE AREAS NEED TO BE SOLVED TO BE ABLE TO WALK FURTHER ON THE MAP. 

THE SPECIALITY OF THIS GAME IS THAT THE PLAYER CAN SWITCH BETWEEN THREE CHARACTERS WITH DIFFERENT ABILITIES ON THE FLY, E.G. ONE CAN JUMP HIGH AND ANOTHER HAS A BETTER GUN. THOSE ARE IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE CHALLENGES THE LEVELS BRING, MOSTLY CONSISTING OF TRADITIONAL PLATFORMING AND AVOIDING/SHOOTING ENEMIES.  HOWEVER, THE BOSS AREA AT THE END OF THE LEVEL MAP HAS TO BE OPENED WITH A MASTER KEY. THERE IS ONE HIDDEN IN EVERY AREA.

THE THREE CHARACTERS ARE BASED ON CHARACTERS OF THE SERIES AND CHANGE DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL. THE HEALTH POOL IS SHARED BETWEEN ALL CHARACTERS AND LOSING ALL HEARTS RESULTS IN LOSING A LIFE. HEARTS CAN BE REFILLED BY COLLECTING MONEY WHICH IS LEFT BEHIND BY KILLED ENEMIES.</desc>

GAMEPLAY IS SOMETHING OF A PENGO VARIANT, AS THE SINGLE-SCREEN LEVELS ARE INHABITED BY ENEMIES, WHO CAN BE KILLED BY FIRING ONE OF THE BALLS AT THEM AT SPEED. WHEN IT HITS ONE IT WILL CONTINUE MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION, REBOUNDING OFF WALLS IF NECCESSARY, AND PUSHING YOU BACKWARDS SLIGHTLY IF IT COMES BACK TO YOU - BUT IT CAN BE INSTANTANEOUSLY BROUGHT BACK UNDER CONTROL. BLOCKS CAN ALSO BE MOVED AT A MORE CASUAL SPEED, INCLUDING ROUND CORNERS. ONCE A BLOCK IS PLACED ONTO ITS SPOT, IT CAN BE USED AGAIN AS A WEAPON. THE LEVELS ARE IN A MAZE STYLE, AND PARTS OF THIS CAN BE OPENED UP. THE GAME ALSO INCLUDES A SMALL BONUS KICK-BALL GAME FOR 2 PLAYERS, WHICH DOUBLES AS PRACTICE WITH THE CONTROL SYSTEM.</desc>

		<name>Benkei Gaiden</name>
		<desc>FOR MANY YEARS, MONSTERS HAVE BEEN TERRORIZING THE PEACEFUL LANDS, UNTIL FINALLY, THE BUDDHIST PRIESTS KNOWN AS THE DHARMA EYES FOUND A SAFE HEAVEN IN A SECLUDED TEMPLE, WHERE THEY RAISED YOUNG MARTIAL ARTISTS WHO WOULD EVENTUALLY LIBERATE THE PEOPLE FROM THE MONSTERS. ONE DAY, ONE OF THESE DISCIPLES WAS KIDNAPPED BY MONSTERS AND TAKEN INTO THEIR TOWER. THE CURRENT DHARMA EYE INSTRUCTS ANOTHER DISCIPLE, NAMED ONIWAKA, TO VENTURE TOWARDS THE TOWER TO THE SOUTH AND FIND A WAY TO RESCUE HIS FRIEND... AND PERHAPS FINALLY PUT AN END TO THE MONSTER INVASION.

BENKEI GAIDEN IS A TRADITIONAL JAPANESE-STYLE RPG, SET IN AN ENVIRONMENT REMINISCENT OF JAPAN OF THE FEUDAL EPOCH, WITH SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS SUCH AS MONSTERS ETC. THE PLAYER NAVIGATES ONIWAKA ON THE TOP-DOWN MAP, VISITING TOWNS, BUYING EQUIPMENT (WEAPONS AND ARMOR), AND FIGHTING RANDOMLY APPEARING ENEMIES IN TURN-BASED COMBAT VIEWED FROM FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE. OBVIOUSLY, THE GAME HAS BEEN HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY THE EARLY  DRAGON QUEST GAMES; THE INTERACTION MENU IS NEARLY IDENTICAL (THE PLAYER HAS TO BRING UP A MENU AND CHOOSE VERB COMMANDS SUCH AS "TALK" OR "SEARCH", RATHER THAN PERFORM DIFFERENT ACTIONS SIMPLY BY PRESSING A BUTTON), AND THE GENERAL GAMEPLAY SYSTEM DOES NOT DEVIATE FROM THE CLASSIC FORMULA.</desc>

THE PEOPLE WERE VERY PROUD OF HIM AND GAVE TOM-TOM THE HIGHEST HONOR OF ALL - THE LEGENDARY NAME OF WONDER BOY. WITH THE EVIL KING DEFEATED, WONDER LAND RETURNED TO ITS PEACEFUL STATE, AND FOR OVER ONE DECADE, THE KINGDOM WAS A PARADISE, AND EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE LIVED HAPPILY TOGETHER.

EVENTUALLY, THE PEACE WAS BROKEN WHEN A FEROCIOUS FIRE-BREATHING DRAGON APPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE AND TOOK OVER WONDER LAND WITH AN ARMY OF EVIL, MONSTEROUS HENCHMEN, CAUSING WONDER LAND WAS IMMEDIATELY THROWN INTO UTTER CHAOS. DEFENSELESS THAT THEY WERE, THE PEOPLE WERE QUICKLY TAKEN OVER AND THE TRANQUIL AND SERENE KINGDOM WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A LAND OF DEMONS AND DEVILS. WONDER LAND WAS NOW A MONSTER LAND. TOM-TOM WAS SUMMONED TO SET OUT ON A JOURNEY, DESTROY THIS DRAGON, AND RESTORE PEACE ONCE AGAIN. TOM-TOM IS WONDER LAND'S LAST HOPE.

THERE ARE TWELVE LOCATIONS IN WHICH TOM-TOM MUST VENTURE THROUGH, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO): THE CITY OF WONDER LAND, VALLEY OF PEACE, THE COASTAL TOWN OF BARABORO, THE MAM DESERT, AND PORORO ISLANDS. DURING HIS JOURNEY, HE MUST DEFEAT MONSTERS WITH THE SWORD THAT HE GOT AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS ADVENTURE. THESE MONSTERS WILL LEAVE EITHER GOLD COINS OR BAGS OF CASH, WHICH HE CAN USE TO BUY BETTER WEAPONS, SHIELDS, ARMORS, AND BOOTS. AT THE END OF EACH LOCATION, THERE IS USUALLY A BOSS THAT TOM-TOM MUST DEFEAT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A GOLD KEY THAT WILL UNLOCK THE EXIT GATE, AS WELL AS PLENTY OF GOLD COINS OR BAGS OF CASH. IF HE TOUCHES ANY ENEMIES, OR IS SHOT AT, HE WILL LOSE HEALTH. DURING HIS TRAVELS, TOM-TOM MUST TAKE NOTE OF THE HOURGLASS; IF THE HOURGLASS DISPLAY SANDS AT THE BOTTOM, HE MUST GET ANOTHER ONE THAT APPEARS OUT OF NOWHERE, OR HE'LL ALSO LOSE HEALTH. THERE ARE TWO WAYS IN WHICH HE CAN RESTORE IT. HE CAN EITHER GO INTO BARS TO HAVE A DRINK THAT WILL RESTORE IT AND GET A HINT ABOUT WHAT LIES AHEAD AS WELL, OR GO INTO HOSPITALS AND HEAL HIMSELF TO RESTORE THE LOST HEALTH.</desc>

THAT'S IT. SO WHAT THIS ALL AMOUNTS TO IS YOU FRANTICALLY SLIDING THE TILES AROUND BLOCK-PUZZLE STYLE TO KEEP THAT CURSED BALL BEARING ON TRACK. GOD FORBID THAT YOU THINK THE BALL IS MOVING TOO SLOWLY, YOU CAN EVEN PUSH A BUTTON TO SPEED THE DAMN THING UP, BUT YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHY YOU WOULD EVER WANT TO DO THAT.</desc>

		<path>./Body Conquest II (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Bodycon Quest II</name>
		<desc>THE STORY OF THIS GAME IS RATHER SIMPLE: THE WORLD IS IN PERIL, AS THE EVIL WITCH TOPAZ SENDS HER SEDUCTIVE MINIONS TO TERRORIZE THE WILDERNESS, PLOTTING TO OVERTHROW THE RIGHTFUL KING AND CONQUER THE WORLD. A YOUNG PRINCE IS BORN, WHO IS DESTINED TO BE THE ONE WHO SLAYS TOPAZ. HIS FIRST QUEST IS TO RETRIEVE A MAGICAL ARMOR WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE VICTORY. BUT THE EVIL SEXY FEMALE DEMONS WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWERS TO STOP THE HERO...

BODYCONQUEST II IS IN MANY WAYS A HOMAGE TO THE FIRST  DRAGON QUEST GAME. THE GAMEPLAY IS NEARLY IDENTICAL: THE LONE HERO FIGHTS RANDOMLY APPEARING ENEMIES IN ONE-ON-ONE BATTLES, GAINS EXPERIENCE AND MONEY, GRADUALLY LEVELS UP, WAITS UNTIL HE CAN AFFORD BETTER WEAPONS AND ARMOR AND VENTURE INTO AN AREA WITH STRONGER MONSTERS, ETC. EVEN THE MENU WITH COMMANDS SUCH AS "TALK" AND "SEARCH" IS COPIED ALMOST VERBATIM FROM THE FATHER OF JAPANESE RPGS.

THE ONE DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF THIS GAME IS THE SEX APPEAL OF THE ENEMIES. THEY ARE YOUNG, FEMALE, AND TEND TO WEAR LESS THAN WHAT WE WOULD USUALLY ASSOCIATE WITH THE MEDIEVAL CODEX OF MODESTY. 

SCANTILY CLAD GIRLS, SUGGESTIVE POSES, AND SEXUAL INNUENDO ABOUND; BUT NO EXPLICIT SCENES WHICH WOULD WARRANT AN ADULT RATING.</desc>

		<name>Bomberman '93</name>
		<desc>BLACK BOMBERMAN HAS CUT POWER TO THE GALAXY'S OWN POWER STATION, WHICH RESULTED IN DISPUTES BETWEEN SEVEN PLANETS, AND IT IS UP TO WHITE BOMBERMAN TO RESTORE POWER TO THE STATION AND BRING PEACE TO THE PLANETS AGAIN. THE OBJECTIVE IS THE SAME AS IN DYNA BLASTER: USE BOMBS TO DESTROY ALL ENEMIES IN A LEVEL. ONCE YOU HAVE DESTROYED THEM ALL, FIND THE EXIT HIDDEN IN A BLOCK SO YOU CAN BE TRANSPORTED TO THE NEXT LEVEL. A BLOCK WILL ALSO FLASH YELLOW TO LET YOU KNOW THAT A POWER-UP CAN BE OBTAINED THERE. POWER-UPS INCLUDE MORE BOMBS, MANUAL DETONATION, EXTRA LIVES, AND EXTENDED FLAMES. OCCASIONALLY, YOU ALSO GET THE ABILITY TO WALK THROUGH BOMBS OR WALLS, OR TO KICK BOMBS.

IF YOU MANAGE TO REVEAL THE EXIT BEFORE ALL ENEMIES ARE DESTROYED, IT REMAINS IN AN "INACTIVE" STATE, MEANING THAT YOU CANNOT BE TRANSPORTED TO THE NEXT LEVEL UNTIL YOU BLOW UP ALL THE ENEMIES AND THEREFORE MAKING IT "ACTIVE". IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY BLOW UP THE EXIT, WHETHER IT IS ACTIVE OR NOT, OR IF TIME RUNS OUT, YOU WILL UNLEASH A FEW ENEMIES THAT YOU ALSO NEED TO DESTROY. AFTER EVERY EIGHTH LEVEL, THERE IS A BOSS THAT YOU NEED TO DESTROY TO PROCEED TO THE NEXT PLANET.

BESIDES THIS NORMAL MODE, THERE ARE TWO OTHER MODES: BATTLE AND VERSUS. IN BATTLE, YOU CAN PLAY AGAINST FOUR HUMAN- OR COMPUTER-CONTROLLED PLAYERS IN ONE OF SEVEN STAGES, EACH WITH DIFFERENT FEATURES LIKE WARP HOLES, CONVEYOR BELTS, REVOLVING DOORS, AND MUCH MORE. IN VERSUS, YOU PLAY HEAD-TO-HEAD AGAINST A FRIEND USING THE TURBOEXPRESS FOR NON-STOP ACTION. REGARDLESS OF THESE TWO MODES, YOU CAN STILL OBTAIN POWER-UPS TO GIVE OUT SOME PUNISHMENT AGAINST YOUR FELLOW PLAYERS, AND THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF WINS CAN BE SET BEFORE PLAY.</desc>

THE RANGE OF EXPLOSION CAN BE UPGRADED WITH TIME, BUT IF YOU DIE, THE RANGE RESETS TO MINIMUM AND YOU LOOSE YOUR PREVIOUS SKILLS, THOUGH. SOME UPDATES CAN MAKE YOU WALK THROUGH THE WALLS, INCREASE YOUR SPEED, AND GIVE YOU SOME OTHER ASSETS TO AID YOU IN YOUR QUEST TO SAVE THE WOMAN YOU LOVE.

THIS TOP-DOWN ACTION-ARCADE GAME CONSISTS OF NINE LEVELS PER STAGE, EACH TOUGHER THAN THE OTHER, AND EACH FINAL CONSISTING OF THE BOSS YOU'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

		<desc>BULLFIGHT: RING NO HASHA IS A BOXING GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYER TAKES PART IN A COMPETITION WITH EIGHT BOXERS. THE TOURNAMENT CONSISTS OF FOUR FIGHTS AND A FINALE AND EACH BOXER CAN BE CONTROLLED BY A HUMAN PLAYER. THE BOXERS HAVE DIFFERENT STATISTICS (STRENGTH, AGILITY AND ENDURANCE) WHICH CAN BE IMPROVED BETWEEN FIGHTS WITH A TRAINING FIGHT. EACH BOXER HAS FOUR MOVES (LEFT SWING, RIGHT SWING, UPPERCUT AND DODGE) AND A HIT BOTH DEPLETES THE OPPONENT'S ENERGY BAR AND GIVES POINTS. SIMILAR TO REAL BOXING, THOSE POINTS ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE WINNER IF NO BOXER IS KNOCKED OUT DURING THE REGULAR ROUNDS. A KNOCKOUT HAPPENS WHEN THE ENERGY RUNS OUT, BUT WHEN THE PLAYER MASHES A BUTTON FAST ENOUGH WHEN THE BOXER IS GIVEN A COUNT, HE STANDS UP AGAIN WITH A PARTLY REPLENISHED ENERGY BAR. 

ADDITIONALLY THERE IS ALSO A SIDE-SCROLLING FIGHTING GAME INCLUDED. HERE THE PLAYER WALKS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT AND FIGHTS ENEMIES IN MARTIAL ARTS MELEE COMBAT.</desc>

		<desc>COLUMNS IS LOOSELY DERIVED FROM TETRIS, AS IT INVOLVES ARRANGING FALLING BLOCKS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CLEAR THEM. HOWEVER, IN COLUMNS THEY ARE GROUPS OF 3 SAME-SIZE BUT VARYING COLOR BLOCKS, WHICH MUST BE ARRANGED INTO SEQUENCES OF 3 OR MORE, EITHER HORIZONTALLY, VERTICALLY OR DIAGONALLY. SEQUENCES OF 4 OR 5 COUNT FOR DOUBLE OR TRIPLE POINTS, AND DIAGONAL SEQUENCES SCORE THE MOST. THE REAL TRICK IS TO SET UP 'COMBOS' - WHERE ONE LINE CAUSES OTHER BLOCKS TO DROP SO AS TO CREATE OTHER LINES.

AS WELL AS THE NORMAL GAME MODE, THERE IS ALSO A 'FLASH' MODE, IN WHICH THE AIM IS SIMPLY TO REMOVE A PARTICULAR BLOCK FROM THE BASE OF THE PRE-FORMED PILE OF BRICKS. THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS CAN BE DETERMINED BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF COMPLETE ROWS WHICH ARE ALREADY IN PLACE.</desc>

		<desc>IN THE 24TH CENTURY, MANKIND HAS GONE INTO SPACE. THE CREW OF THE STARSHIP SWORDFISH ARE IN AN ENGAGEMENT WITH SPACE PIRATES WHEN THE BATTLE TAKES A TURN FOR THE WORSE. IN DESPERATION, THE CREW ACTIVATE THEIR JUMP DRIVE WITHOUT A DESTINATION... AND END UP FLUNG ACROSS THE GALAXY TO THE GALACTIC CORE. THE SWORDFISH HOWEVER IS BADLY DAMAGED WITH MANY CASUALTIES INCLUDING THE CAPTAIN. ONLY 26 OF THE CREW SURVIVE, AND OF THEM ONLY 6 ARE QUALIFIED FOR COMBAT: THE COMMANDER, TWO SOLDIERS, A MECHANIC AND A DOCTOR AND SIX GIANT "MODULE" MECHANIZED SUITS AVAILABLE FOR THEM. THESE SURVIVORS LOCATE PLANET FARWORLD, APPARENTLY COLONIZED BY HUMANS. THERE THEY DISCOVER THE COLONY IS UNDER ATTACK BY A RELENTLESS MECHANICAL ALIENS DUBBED "BERSERKERS". THE CREW OF THE SWORDFISH MUST FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE BERSERKERS AND EXPLORE THE GALAXY FOR SOME MEANS TO RETURN HOME.

CYBER KNIGHT IS AN RPG WITH A SCIENCE-FICTION THEME OF BEING LOST IN AN ALIEN GALAXY. THE GAME TAKES PLACE IN A TOP-DOWN VIEW FOR MOVEMENT ON PLANETS AND AREAS, A SIDE-VIEW FOR COMBAT SEQUENCES AND A FIRST PERSON MENU SYSTEM WHEN ABOARD THE SWORDFISH STARSHIP. THE SWORDFISH CAN TRAVEL BETWEEN STARS, SCANNING WORLDS FOR INFORMATION. IF THE SHIP IS ABLE TO LAND ON A PLANET, THREE CREW MEMBERS PILOTING THREE MODULES (GIANT ROBOTS) CAN BE SELECTED TO DEBARK AND EXPLORE THE PLANET. MANY PLANETS WILL HAVE TOWNS OR PEOPLE LIVING ON THEM WHICH CAN BE TALKED TO IN ORDER TO UNCOVER INFORMATION. DIFFERENT QUESTS ARE ASSIGNED IN ORDER TO FIND THE ITEMS NECESSARY TO PROGRESS. THERE IS NO SYSTEM OF CURRENCY OR BUYING ITEMS. INSTEAD, MANY DEFEATED BERSERKERS LEAVE BEHIND "NEOPARTS", WHICH CAN BE BROUGHT BACK TO THE SWORDFISH'S LAB. ANALYSIS OF THESE NEO PARTS UNLOCKS ENHANCES STATISTICS (ENDURANCE, AGILITY, ACCURACY, ETC) FOR THE MODULES AND NEW WEAPONS FOR THEM TO CARRY. THE SIX MODULES ARE UNIQUE IN STATISTICS, AND ALSO THE SIX PILOTS EACH CARRY DIFFERENT SKILLS.

COMBAT TAKES PLACE IN TURN-BASED COMBAT ON A 6X6 SQUARES FIELD. SEEN FROM THE SIDE VIEW, THE THREE MODULES CAN BE POSITIONED IN RELATION TO ENEMIES IN ORDER TO ATTACK, USING A VARIETY OF MELEE AND LONG-RANGED WEAPONRY. AMMUNITION IS UNLIMITED, BUT EACH MODULE ALSO CARRIES A NUMBER OF "OPTIONS" THAT ARE CONSUMABLE ATTACKS. EACH MODULE HAS TWO SETS OF HITPOINTS: ONE FOR THE PILOT AND ONE FOR THE MODULE ITSELF. IF EITHER ONE OF THESE REACHES ZERO, THE MODULE IS DESTROYED. IN ORDER TO HEAL, THE PARTY CARRIES 10 EACH OF REPAIR KITS AND FIRST AID KITS, WHICH MUST WHEN NOT IN COMBAT. THESE KITS, AS WELL AS OPTIONS AND DEFEATED PILOTS OR MODULES CAN BE RESTORED BY RETURNING TO THE SWORDFISH.</desc>

		<desc>DOUBLE DUNGEONS IS A SOLO DUNGEON CRAWLER IN THE STRICTEST SENSE. ONE OR TWO PLAYERS CAN EXPLORE PSEUDO-3D, MAZE-LIKE DUNGEONS (WITHOUT AUTO-MAP FEATURE, BUT WITH DIRECTIONS DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN) AND FIGHT THE MONSTERS POPULATING THEM. THE PLAYER(S) CAN CHOOSE TO VENTURE INTO ANY OF THE AVAILABLE 20 DUNGEONS. THE DUNGEONS HAVE THE SAME TEXTURES, BUT THEIR LAYOUT VARIES; THE HIGHER IS THE NUMBER OF THE CHOSEN DUNGEON, THE MORE DANGEROUS ARE ITS ENEMIES. TWO-PLAYER MODE FEATURES A SPLIT SCREEN; THE TWO PLAYERS START EXPLORING THE DUNGEON FROM DIFFERENT POINTS.

THE BASIC GAMEPLAY IS VERY SIMPLE. ENEMIES APPEAR AT SPECIFIC POINTS (THEY CAN ALSO RE-SPAWN), AND MUST BE DEFEATED IN ORDER TO PROCEED. THE COMBAT IS TURN-BASED AT ITS CORE, THOUGH THE TURNS FOLLOW VERY QUICKLY, AND THE ENEMIES WILL ATTACK EVEN IF THE PLAYER DOES NOTHING. ATTACKING IS DONE SIMPLY BY PRESSING A BUTTON; THERE ARE NO OTHER COMBAT OPTIONS. 

THE PLAYER CAN FIND EQUIPMENT AND HEALING ITEMS (WHICH CAN ALSO BE DROPPED BY ENEMIES). THESE CAN BE USED TO RESTORE THE PLAYER CHARACTER'S HP OUTSIDE OF BATTLES. LEVELING UP IS COMPLETELY AUTOMATIC.

THERE IS NO NARRATIVE IN THE GAME; THE ONLY STORY-RELATED INFORMATION COMES IN FORM OF VERY SHORT TEXT INTROS TO THE DIFFERENT DUNGEONS, ALONG THE LINES OF "THE KING WANTS TO RETRIEVE A TREASURE AND SENDS A WARRIOR INTO THE DUNGEON" OR COMPARABLE MISSION OBJECTIVES.</desc>

THEN THE RACE IS READY TO GO - EACH RACER CAN FREELY MOVE AROUND THE TRACK, HIT EACH OTHER OR USE SPECIAL ATTACKS COLLECTED ALONG THE WAY (SUCH AS LIGHTNING BOLTS, GRENADES AND SO FORTH). EACH ROBOT ALSO COMES WITH A LIFE BAR AND THE RACE IS OVER AS SOON AS IT REACHES ZERO. ADDITIONALLY, FIGHTING RUN FEATURES A VERSUS-MODE WHERE TWO PLAYERS, OR TWO AI CONTROLLED OPPONENTS, CAN RACE AGAINST EACH OTHER, AS WELL AS A TOURNAMENT-MODE WHERE EIGHT ROBOTS AND THEIR PILOTS RACE (TWO AT THE TIME) FOR A GOLDEN TROPHY.</desc>

TO DO SO, YOU MUST TRAVEL FROM TOWN TO TOWN FINDING CHALLENGES AND WINNING THEM TO GAIN MONEY AND SPECIAL ITEMS TO IMPROVE YOUR CAR.

THE LIGHT AND DARK FORCES ARE ENGAGED IN A FIERCE WAR AND BÖSER, LEADER OF THE DARK ARMY, IS NOW READY TO CAPTURE THE RALL TOWER, SOURCE OF THE WORLD'S ENERGY. SIEGHART, LEADER OF THE LIGHT ARMY, IS THE ONLY ONE WHO STANDS BETWEEN THE EVIL BÖSER AND THE COMPLETE DECIMATION OF THE KINGDOM. GAIA NO MONSH? IS A TURN-BASED STRATEGY GAME AT HEART - THE PLAYER MOVES TROOPS AROUND A BATTLEFIELD AND ATTACKS NEARBY ENEMY UNITS. AN AUTO BATTLE MODE IS ALSO AVAILABLE AND GIVES THE OPTION TO LET THE AI FIGURE OUT OF THE PLAYER'S NEXT MOVE. THE GAME OFFERS SEVERAL PLAY MODES - THE FIRST ONE (SCENARIO MODE) GIVES THE PLAYER THE CHANCE TO JUMP STRAIGHT INTO BATTLE USING PREDEFINED TROOPS. THE SECOND (CONSTRUCTION MODE) ALLOWS HIM TO BUILD HIS OWN ARMY USING UNIT POINTS. THE LAST ONE (CAMPAIGN MODE) CONVEYS STORY PLOT ELEMENTS AND STARTS IN THE SIEGE TOWN OF DIRL, WHERE KING SIEGHART BATTLES THE FIERCE BÖSER. THIS MODE REQUIRES MORE COMPLEX STRATEGY AND THE PLAYER MUST ASSEMBLE HIS OWN TROOPS USING UNIT POINTS AND UNITS LOST IN BATTLE DON'T COME BACK DURING THE CAMPAIGN. UNLIKE THE OTHER TWO MODES, IT OFFERS A PASSWORD SYSTEM TO SAVE THE PLAYER'S PROGRESS THROUGH THE GAME.</desc>

		<desc>GALAGA '88 TAKES THE BASIC GAMEPLAY OF GALAGA AND ADDS HIGHER-QUALITY GRAPHICS, TRIPLE SHIP ABILITIES, PARSEC PROGRESSION, POWER-UPS, ASTEROIDS, BOSSES AND OTHER ENHANCEMENTS. PERIODICALLY THE PLAYER ENCOUNTERS CHALLENGING STAGES, WHICH ARE SET TO MUSIC AND FEATURE "DANCING" ENEMIES.  THE OBJECTIVE IS TO SHOOT ALL 40 ENEMIES BEFORE THEY DISAPPEAR, FOR A BONUS OF AT LEAST 10,000 POINTS. THERE ARE A TOTAL OF 29 STAGES. THE PLAYER CAN BEGIN WITH ONE SHIP WITH TWO IN RESERVE OR START RIGHT OUT WITH A DUAL SHIP (BUT ONLY ONE IN RESERVE).  

SOME ENEMIES NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMBINE INTO A MUCH LARGER SINGLE ENEMY THAT TAKES MULTIPLE SHOTS TO DESTROY. OTHERS EXPLODE IN A BRILLIANT SHOWER OF FIREWORKS WHEN DESTROYED, AND OCCASIONALLY THESE ENEMIES DROP A SMALL FORMATION OF MUCH SMALLER ENEMIES THAT "WIGGLE" THEIR WAY DOWN THE SCREEN.  SOME ENEMIES ARRIVE IN SPHERICAL "EGGS" AND EMIT A LOUD, HIGH-PITCHED NOISE WHEN HIT. THESE CREATURES TAKE MULTIPLE HITS TO DESTROY IN FLIGHT (JUST ONE HIT IN FORMATION), AND THEIR MAIN ATTACK PATTERN IS TO MOVE ABOUT HALFWAY DOWN THE SCREEN, STOP, FIRE MULTIPLE SHOTS AT ONCE, AND THEN FLY STRAIGHT DOWN OFF THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.  ANOTHER TYPE OF ENEMY TAKES AT LEAST FIVE HITS TO DESTROY, AND IT GROWS LARGER WITH EACH CONSECUTIVE HIT, MAKING IT BOTH A LARGER TARGET AND ALLOWING IT TO ACT AS A SHIELD TO OTHER ENEMIES. 

LATER IN THE GAME SOME ENEMIES ARE EQUIPPED WITH ARMOR THAT RENDERS THEM INVINCIBLE WHILE IN FORMATION. WHEN ONE OF THESE ENEMIES STARTS ITS DIVE, IT WILL FLIP OVER AND EXPOSE ITS VULNERABLE SIDE, THEN FLIP OVER AGAIN AND BECOME INVINCIBLE WHILE IT MOVES BACK UP THE SCREEN, THEN FLIP ONE MORE TIME AND FINISH ITS DIVE. WHILE VULNERABLE, THIS ENEMY CAN BE DESTROYED IN ONE HIT, SCORING BONUS POINTS. IN ADDITION, MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF OBSTACLES APPEAR THROUGHOUT THE GAME, INCLUDING BLUE CRYSTALS, BOULDERS AND GREEN BLOBS.</desc>

YOU MUST FIND THE PIECES OF YOUR BODY STREWN ABOUT EACH MAZE-LIKE STAGE, WHICH INCREASE YOUR SIZE, AND USE YOUR LENGTH TO SURROUND ITEMS, FOOD, AND ENEMIES IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THEM. YOU CAN ALSO USE BOMBS TO STUN MORE DANGEROUS ENEMIES.

DIFFERENT STAGES MAY HAVE DIFFERENT GOALS -- FOR EXAMPLE, YOU MAY HAVE TO FIND A KEY, OR USE YOUR SURROUND ABILITY ON FLOOR TILES TO REVEAL ITEMS OR ENEMIES. ONLY YOUR SNAKE'S HEAD IS VULNERABLE; IF AN ENEMY HITS YOUR BODY IT WILL SCATTER ALL THE PIECES AND YOU'LL HAVE TO COLLECT THEM AGAIN. AFTER COMPLETING SET CONDITIONS ON EACH STAGE, A DOOR WILL OPEN THAT LEADS TO THE NEXT STAGE, AT WHICH POINT YOU'LL BE JUST A HEAD AGAIN, AND WILL HAVE TO HUNT FOR YOUR BODY ONCE MORE.

THE GAME HAS THE SAME UNIQUE UPL STYLE THAT WILL BE FAMILIAR TO FANS OF GAMES SUCH AS ATOMIC ROBO-KID AND MUTANT NIGHT.</desc>

IN EACH SCENARIO, THE SERDS - A LEAGUE OF SPECIALIZED ATTACK MECHA - ARE DEPLOYED FROM THEIR HQ SHIP ALTEA. THE SERDS ALL HAVE SINGLE-LETTER CODE-NAMES AND DIFFERENT SPECIALIZATIONS: FOR EXAMPLE, THE G-SERD WIELDS A LASER SWORD FOR DEVASTATING MELEE ATTACKS AND CAN MOVE QUICKLY, WHILE THE B-SERD IS CAPABLE OF LONG-RANGE MORTAR ATTACKS BUT HAS LIMITED MOVEMENT. THE EPONYMOUS X-SERD IS THE MOST POWERFUL OF THE TEAM.</desc>

SIMILAR TO ADVENTURE ISLAND, YOU MUST MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH SEVERAL LEVELS, DESTROYING WILDLIFE ALONG THE WAY, BUT INSTEAD OF USING A HAMMER, YOU HAVE THREE DIFFERENT WAYS TO KILL THEM: JUMP ON OR KICK THEM, OR WHEN THEY ARE WALKING ON THE GROUND, BLOW GAS OUT OF THEM. 

WHILE SCROLLING THROUGH THE LEVEL, YOUR VITALITY WILL DECREASE, BUT IT CAN BE RESTORED BY COLLECTING FRUIT AND JUNK FOOD. DURING YOUR TRAVELS, YOU WILL ALSO ENCOUNTER YOUR PARTNER DOING THINGS THAT SHOULDN'T BE DONE IN PUBLIC, BUT SOMETIMES, HE WILL THROW STUFF AT YOU TO MAKE YOU LOSE SOME OF YOUR VITALITY. THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN DEAL WITH HIM IS BY KICKING HIM WHERE IT HURTS.

ALONG THE WAY, YOU CAN ENTER DOORS. DOING THIS WILL GIVE YOU A HINT ABOUT THE LEVEL AND YOUR VITALITY WILL BE INCREASED AS WELL. YOU CAN KICK CERTAIN OBJECTS SUCH AS LAMP POSTS, TRASHCANS, OR THIN AIR TO OBTAIN COINS, OR TO MAKE HIDDEN PLATFORMS APPEAR. COINS CAN BE USED IN SLOT MACHINES THAT WILL GIVE YOU EXTRA VITALITY, MORE LIVES, EXTRA COINS, AND MORE. SLOT MACHINES ONLY APPEAR WHEN YOU ENTER CERTAIN DOORS.</desc>

		<name>Lady Sword: Ryakudatsusareta 10-nin no Otome</name>
		<desc>IN THIS GAME, THE PLAYER TAKES CONTROL OF A YOUNG NAMELESS TRAVELER. ONE DAY, THE HERO MEETS A MAN WHO TELLS HIM A SAD STORY: MONSTERS HAVE KIDNAPPED HIS GRANDDAUGHTER, AND LOCKED HER AWAY IN A TOWER. APPARENTLY, THE MONSTERS ALSO TOOK AWAY NINE OTHER YOUNG GIRLS, AND HAVE SOME EVIL PLANS IN MIND. THE HERO AGREES TO VENTURE INTO THE TOWER'S LABYRINTH AND SUCCEED WHERE NO OTHER ADVENTURER COULD...

LADY SWORD IS A FIRST-PERSON SOLO DUNGEON CRAWLER. THE PLAYER NAVIGATES THE HERO THROUGH THE COMPLEX, MAZE-LIKE CORRIDORS OF THE TOWER (WITH AN AUTO-MAP FEATURE), TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT WAY TO THE STAIRS TO THE NEXT FLOOR. FAKE WALLS, TELEPORTERS, ONE-WAY DOORS, ITEMS THAT MUST BE COLLECTED TO UNLOCK HIDDEN PASSAGES, BOSS ENEMIES, ETC., ARE THERE TO MAKE THIS TASK HARDER THAN IT LOOKS. REGULAR ENEMIES POP OUT RANDOMLY, AND MUST BE DEFEATED IN A VERY SIMPLE TURN-BASED COMBAT. 

THERE IS NO DAMAGE FEEDBACK FOR THE HERO (THOUGH THE PLAYER CAN SEE EXACTLY HOW BADLY THE HERO HIMSELF IS HURT), NO WEAPONS, ARMOR, OR ITEMS FOR COMBAT USAGE. THE PLAYER CAN HEAL THE HERO'S WOUNDS BY SELECTING "SLEEP" FROM THE MENU. SLEEPING RESTORES THE HERO TO FULL HP; BUT IF HE RESTS TOO MUCH, A TOUGH DEMON WILL APPEAR AND ATTACK.

CHARACTER GROWTH IS HANDLED VIA DIRECT STAT INCREASING; THERE ARE NO "LEVELS", AND THE HERO'S HP, ATTACK AND DEFENSE POWER, AS WELL AS AGILITY, INCREASE GRADUALLY THE MORE HE FIGHTS.

ON EACH FLOOR, A DIGITIZED PHOTO OF A YOUNG WOMAN WILL GREET THE HERO AND ENCOURAGE THE PLAYER TO EXPLORE FURTHER - AT THE STAIRS TO THE NEXT FLOOR, SHOULD THE HERO OVERCOME ALL THE OBSTACLES, THE PLAYER WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE GIRL NAKED.</desc>

THE CHEQUERED PLATFORMS AT THE END OF A LEVEL ARE STATIC RATHER THAN MOVING, HOPPING ON TO THEM AUTOMATICALLY TAKES YOU TO THE BOSS.

		<desc>THE STORY OF THIS GAME IS LOOSELY BASED ON THE 19TH CENTURY JAPANESE EPIC NOVEL NANS? SATOMI HAKKENDEN ("TALE OF EIGHT DOGS") BY KYOKUTEI BAKIN. IN THE GAME, THE PLAYER CONTROLS A YOUNG WARRIOR NAMED SHIN. THE ELDER OF HIS HOME VILLAGE TELLS HIM THAT A MAGICAL ARTIFACT KNOWN AS THE STATUE OF THE FOUR GODS HAS BEEN STOLEN. THIS ARTIFACT WAS SEALING AWAY THE SPIRIT OF THE EVIL TAMAZUSA. TO PREVENT TAMAZUSA'S RESURRECTION, SHIN MUST FIND SEVEN OTHER WARRIORS. ONLY WHEN THEY ARE UNITED CAN THE EVIL BE DEFEATED ONCE AND FOR ALL...

DESPITE THE PREMISE OF EIGHT WARRIORS, MAKAI HAKKENDEN SHADA IS AN ACTION RPG IN WHICH THE PLAYER CONTROLS ONLY SHIN. THE GAME IS SIMILAR TO THE BETTER-KNOWN  YS GAMES IN MANY WAYS. AS IN YS, THE HERO FIGHTS ENEMIES SIMPLY BY "BUMPING" INTO THEM. DEFEATED ENEMIES PRODUCE MONEY, WHICH CAN BE SPENT IN VILLAGES TO PURCHASE WEAPONS AND VARIOUS TYPES OF ARMOR, AND EXPERIENCE POINTS. ONCE A SET AMOUNT OF THOSE IS ACCUMULATED, THE HERO GAINS A LEVEL.

LATER IN THE GAME SHIN RECEIVES SPELLS AND SPECIAL TECHNIQUES, WHICH MUST BE EXECUTED ACTIVELY, BY PRESSING A BUTTON. THERE IS ALSO A "SEARCH" COMMAND IN THE GAME, WHICH IS REQUIRED TO USE TO SOLVE CERTAIN SITUATIONS.</desc>

		<desc>NECROS NO YOUSAI, OR NECLOS NO YOUSAI, ("FORTRESS OF NECLOS/NECROS") IS A TRADITIONAL JAPANESE RPG THAT WAS RELEASED EXCLUSIVELY ON THE PC ENGINE. IT IS BASED ON THE TOYLINE OF THE SAME NAME, WHICH WAS ONE OF MANY BRANDS OF "SHOKUGAN" OR "FOOD TOYS" - SMALL FIGURINES PACKAGED WITH CANDY THAT WERE INTENDED FOR CHILDREN. THE TOYLINE FEATURED THE EVIL SORCERER NECLOS/NECROS, THE EIGHT HEROIC CHAMPIONS SENT TO DEFEAT HIM AND NECLOS/NECROS'S VARIOUS HENCHMONSTERS.

THE GAME CONTROLS LIKE A STANDARD RPG AND ALTERNATES BETWEEN A TOP-DOWN VIEW FOR TALKING TO NPCS AND EXPLORING TOWNS AND DUNGEONS AND A FIRST-PERSON VIEW FOR ITS TURN-BASED COMBAT. THE VARIOUS CHARACTERS LAUNCH INTO LITTLE ANIMATED VIGNETTES WHENEVER THEY ATTACK, AND EACH OF THE HEROES HAS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES SPECIFIC TO THEIR CLASS WHICH THE PLAYER CAN BUILD STRATEGIES AROUND.</desc>

		<desc>SOME YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE BRAVE HERO JAZETA DESTROYED DIRTH, THE EMPEROR OF DARKNESS. PEACE HAS RETURNED TO THE LAND OF NEUTOPIA. BUT THERE ARE STILL MONSTERS ROAMING THE COUNTRYSIDE, AND SOME OF THEM WERE SPOTTED NEAR YURIUS SHRINE. JAZETA WENT THERE TO FIND OUT WHAT EXACTLY HAD HAPPENED. BUT HE DIDN'T RETURN... YOU ARE JAZETA'S SON, AND YOU MUST FIRST OF ALL FIND YOUR MISSING FATHER! CAN IT BE THAT THE SHADOW OF EMPEROR OF DARKNESS THREATENS THE PEACEFUL LAND AGAIN?..

THE SEQUEL TO "NEUTOPIA" IS SIMILAR TO THE PREDECESSOR IN EVERY WAY. NAVIGATING YOUR HERO FROM A TOP-DOWN VIEW, YOU EXPLORE THE VAST COUNTRYSIDE, FIGHTING MONSTERS IN REAL TIME COMBAT. THE GAME IS NOT A TRUE RPG, BUT AN ACTION ADVENTURE: YOU DON'T GAIN ANY EXPERIENCE POINTS FROM COMBAT, ONLY COLLECT MONEY TO BUY SUPPLIES. IN DUNGEONS, YOU MUST USE BOMBS ON WALLS TO REVEAL SECRET PASSAGES, PUSH STONES, AND FIGHT MANY REGULAR ENEMIES AND BOSSES.</desc>

IT APPEARS THAT ONCE DIRTH WAY SEALED BY EIGHT WISE MEN WHO USED THE POWER OF EIGHT SACRED MEDALLIONS. PRINCESS AURORA IS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO USE THOSE MEDALLIONS, AND THAT IS WHY DIRTH ABDUCTED HER. THE HERO MUST EXPLORE THE LAND, DESCEND TO THE DANGEROUS LABYRINTHS, RETRIEVE THE EIGHT MEDALLIONS, RESCUE THE PRINCESS, AND DEFEAT DIRTH.

VERY SIMILAR TO  ZELDA GAMES, NEUTOPIA ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO FREELY ROAM THE VAST LAND, FIGHTING MANY DIFFERENT MONSTERS IN WILDERNESS AREAS AS WELL AS IN DUNGEONS. DUNGEONS ALSO REQUIRE SOME PUZZLE-SOLVING (PUSHING STONES, BLOWING WALLS WITH BOMBS, ETC.). THE GAME HAS A SLIGHT RPG FLAVOR, ALLOWING THE PLAYER TO POWER-UP BY COLLECTING VARIOUS ITEMS, AND EQUIP DIFFERENT WEAPONS AND ARMOR.</desc>

EVERYONE WHO WAS INVITED TO THE WEDDING BEGINS TO CELEBRATE WHEN, SUDDENLY, THE EVIL BARON BRONSKY APPEARS AND SNATCHES TINA AWAY, WHILE HIS HENCHMEN TAKE THE SIX CHILDREN AWAY. TO REACH HIS CASTLE AND RESCUE TINA, MASTER HIGGINS MUST FIRST RESCUE THE SIX CHILDREN, EACH OF WHOM IS HIDDEN ON A SEPARATE ISLAND.

NEW ADVENTURE ISLAND IS A ONE-PLAYER ACTION GAME THAT CONSISTS OF SEVEN AREAS, WITH FOUR ROUNDS EACH. IN ORDER TO GET THROUGH THE AREAS, YOU MUST USE YOUR HATCHET TO DESTROY WILDLIFE SUCH AS FROGS, SPIDERS, BIRDS, SNAILS, INSECTS, AND OTHER PESTS, AND WATCH OUT FOR HAZARDS SUCH AS ROCKS, FIRE, WATER, AND PITS. 

AS YOU PROGRESS FURTHER, YOUR VITALITY WILL GET LOW, SO FRUIT MUST BE COLLECTED IN ORDER TO RESTORE IT. ALONG THE WAY, YOU CAN SMASH OPEN EGGS THAT WILL AWARD YOU WITH BETTER WEAPONS THAT INCLUDE BOOMERANGS, ARROWS, AND MAGICAL FIRE. SOME OF THE EGGS WILL ALSO REVEAL A FAIRY, WHICH WILL PROTECT YOU FROM GETTING HIT. IF YOU ARE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND AN EGGPLANT HIDDEN IN ONE OF THESE EGGS, YOUR VITALITY WILL DRAIN AWAY VERY FAST, AND YOU NEED TO GET FRUIT EVERY FIVE SECONDS IN ORDER TO SURVIVE.

WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF AN AREA, YOU WILL HAVE TO DEFEAT ONE OF THE HENCHMEN AND RESCUE A CHILD FROM ONE OF THE FOUR CASTLES.

OPERATION WOLF IS AN ARCADE GAME BY TAITO. IT IS ESSENTIALLY A BITMAPPED "RAIL-SHOOTER", WHERE YOU BASICALLY HOLD THE GUN AND SHOOT JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT MOVES, WHILE CONSERVING YOUR AMMO AND GRENADES. SHOOT AMMO/GRENADES AND HEALING ITEMS ON THE SCREEN TO "PICK THEM UP". YOUR PRIMARY MACHINE GUN CAN KILL EVERYTHING IF YOU HIT IT ENOUGH TIMES, BUT YOU CAN ALSO USE THE GRENADE LAUNCHER FOR REALLY DEADLY TARGETS LIKE HELICOPTERS OR ARMORED CARS. YOU CAN COLLECT A MACHINE GUN WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO SHOOT FASTER FOR A FEW SECONDS. 

YOU'LL BE PUMMELLED BY A LOT OF ENEMIES. SOME WILL BE SHOOTING, OTHERS WILL BE TOSSING GRENADES, KNIFES, AND MORE. SOME ARE ARMORED AND REQUIRES MORE THAN A FEW HITS, OTHERS DODGES. YOU CAN SHOOT GRENADES AND KNIFES OUT OF THE AIR IF YOU AIM WELL ENOUGH. THERE ARE ALSO CIVILIANS RUNNING AROUND WHICH CAN BE SHOT, BUT IT'S NOT BENEFICIAL. 

BOSSES APPEAR AT THE END OF SOME LEVELS, AND EACH HAS A SPECIFIC WEAKNESS YOU NEED TO EXPLOIT.</desc>

BUT A MYSTERIOUS ORGANIZATION THAT CALLS ITSELF MARS BEGAN TO STIR UNREST ON THE PLANET. THE HEAD OF IMPERIAL SCOUTS SENDS THE HERO, PILOTING A COMBAT ROBOT KNOWN AS FW, INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE RUINS, TO FACE THE ENEMIES AND RETRIEVE THE PRECIOUS KNOWLEDGE...

OUT LIVE IS A SOLO DUNGEON CRAWLER; UNLIKE MOST REPRESENTATIVES OF THIS GENRE, IT IS SET IN A SCI-FI ENVIRONMENT, AND THE PLAYER CONTROLS A GIANT ROBOT RATHER THAN A MEDIEVAL WARRIOR. MOST OF THE ENEMIES ARE ALSO MACHINES AND ROBOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS.

BEFORE VENTURING INTO THE DUNGEON, THE PLAYER HAS ACCESS TO VARIOUS SHOPS, WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE TO REPAIR THE ROBOT, BUY WEAPONS, PROTECTIVE SHIELDS, AND ITEMS THAT RESTORE THE ROBOT'S ENERGY. MOST OF THE GAMEPLAY TAKES PLACE IN PSEUDO-3D, MAZE LIKE UNDERGROUND COMPLEXES (WITHOUT AN AUTO-MAP, BUT WITH A COMPASS FEATURE). THERE, THE GAME PLAYS SIMILARLY TO OTHER DUNGEON CRAWLERS: RANDOM ENEMIES MUST BE FOUGHT IN TURN-BASED FASHION; THEY DROP MONEY AND AWARD THE PLAYER CHARACTER WITH EXPERIENCE POINTS.

A SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL FEATURE IS DOUBLE LEVELING: THE ROBOT HAS TWO INDEPENDENT LEVELS, FOR ATTACK AND FOR DEFENSE. THE EXPERIENCE POINTS THE ROBOT RECEIVES AFTER BATTLES ALSO COME IN TWO DIFFERENT FLAVORS. DEPENDING ON THE ENEMY TYPE AND OUTCOME OF THE BATTLE, THE ROBOT RECEIVES DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF EXPERIENCE. THE LEVELING-UP ITSELF IS AUTOMATIC, INCREASING MAXIMUM ENERGY, ATTACK AND DEFENSE PARAMETERS.</desc>

WHILE AIR ZONK DIFFERED FROM ITS SUCCESSOR IN TERMS OF GAMEPLAY, THE CARTOONISH STYLE OF THE BONK SERIES COULD STILL BE SEEN ALL THROUGHOUT THE GAME, ESPECIALLY IN THE GRAPHICS, THE CHARACTERS, &amp; OF COURSE, ZONK HIMSELF.

AIR ZONK MAY APPEAR TO FEATURE A CANDY CARTOON COATING ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT IT'S STILL A TRADITIONAL SHOOT-'EM-UP AT HEART. YOU STILL HAVE A SELECTION OF YOUR BASIC WEAPON POWER-UPS (8 IN TOTAL HERE), BUT SPREAD GUNS &amp; POWERFUL BURSTS ARE NOW REPRESENTED BY KILLER DECKS OF CARDS &amp; GIANT METAL MANDIBLES. LARGE, IMPOSING ENDBOSSES ARE STILL THE NORM, BUT HERE YOUR FOES RANGE FROM GIANT HEAPS OF LIVING GARBAGE TO KILLER FOOTBALL PLAYERS. AND OUTER SPACE? WHO NEEDS TO BLOW UP THINGS THERE WHEN YOU HAVE OTHER VENUES (5 IN TOTAL) SUCH AS A GIGANTIC STADIUM TO DO IT IN?

IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THIS, AIR ZONK GIVES YOU A FEATURE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CHOOSE FROM ONE OF 10 "FRIENDS" AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH LEVEL WHO WILL FIGHT BY YOUR SIDE ONCE YOU PICK UP A CERTAIN POWER-UP. THESE FRIENDS RANGE FROM GIANT SCUD MISSILES TO LIVING DUMP TRUCKS TO FLOATING COW-THINGS, AMONG OTHERS. PICK UP ANOTHER POWER-UP, &amp; ZONK &amp; HIS FRIEND COMBINE TO CREATE A POWERFUL HYBRID FORM, FEATURING SOME OF THE STRANGEST ATTACKS YOU MAY EVER SEE IN A VIDEO GAME.

SO WILL ZONK BE ABLE TO DEFEAT KING DROOL, RESCUE THE MOON FROM HIS CLUTCHES, &amp; SAVE THE WORLD? AS USUAL, THE ANSWER IS UP TO YOU...</desc>

		<desc>BONK'S ADVENTURE IS A PREHISTORIC PLATFORM GAME WHERE YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF A LARGE BALD HEADED CAVEMAN, GUIDING HIM THROUGH THE LEVELS TAKING OUT ALL MANNER OF STRANGE PREHISTORIC CREATURES THAT GET IN YOUR WAY INCLUDING KING DROOLS HENCHMEN - ALL IN EFFORT TO FREE THE CAPTURED/CONTROLLED RESIDENTS OF MOONLAND (BOSSES) - INCLUDING THE PRINCESS ZA FROM KING DROOL ATTEMPTED TAKE OVER.

THE GAME IS NOT UNLIKE OTHER PLATFORM GAMES OF THE ERA. THOUGH IT'S UNIQUE IN THAT YOU CAN CLIMB WALLS AND SWING ON ROPE WITH YOUR TEETH AND YOUR ONLY METHOD OF ATTACK IS HEAD BUTTING ENEMIES - STRAIGHT FORWARD OR DIVE BOMB STYLE. THE GAME STARTS OFF WITH SIMPLISTIC POINT A TO POINT B STYLE, BUT FOCUSES MORE ON EXPLORATION IN THE LATER STAGES, WHICH INCLUDE FINDING HIDDEN BONUS AREAS. 

THE GAME IS ALSO KNOWN FOR ITS TRADEMARK GAMEPLAY MECHANISM OF 'SPIN ATTACK', WHERE BONK FLOATS THROUGH THE AIR IF YOU HAVE THE TURBO BUTTON ON. THIS CAN BE USED TO FLOAT AROUND THE LEVEL AND REACH AREAS FOR EXTRA/HIDDEN ITEMS, BUT ALSO AS A METHOD OF ATTACK AS WELL. THE GAME STARTS YOU OFF WITH 3 HEARTS, BUT ALLOWS YOU TO INCREASE THIS NUMBER WHEN YOU FIND SPECIAL HEART CONTAINER ITEMS, ALLOWING BONK TO TAKE A NUMBER OF HITS BEFORE DYING.

A VARIETY OF BONUS STAGES CAN BE FOUND THROUGHOUT THE GAME, WHICH PROVIDE BONUS POINTS UPON COMPLETION AND THUS RESULTING IN ACCUMULATING EXTRA LIVES. ENEMIES THEMSELVES CAN BE 'MILKED' FOR POINTS IN THAT YOU CAN KEEP 'BONKING' THEIR DEAD BODIES AND NOT LETTING THEM HIT THE GROUND. SPIN ATTACK IS ANOTHER METHOD FOR DOING THIS.</desc>

		<desc>YOU PLAY A GOD, GAMING AGAINST OTHER GODS IN A CELESTIAL GAME OF CONQUEST.  TO WIN, YOU MUST HELP YOUR CHOSEN PEOPLE TAKE OVER THE WORLD AND WIPE OUT THE VERMIN WHO WORSHIP THAT OTHER GOD.

EACH GOD STARTS OUT WITH A SINGLE HUMAN, DUMPED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE WILDERNESS.  SOMETIMES THERE IS INHABITABLE LAND IN SIGHT, SOMETIMES NOT.  TO GET WIN, YOU MUST CHANGE THE LANDSCAPE, CREATING FLAT LAND FOR YOUR FOLLOWERS TO BUILD ON.  THE MORE FOLLOWERS YOU HAVE YOU HAVE, THE MORE POWERFUL YOU WILL BE, SO TAKE CARE OF THEM. BUILD AS FAST AS YOU CAN, BECAUSE THE OTHER GOD IS DOING THE SAME.

WHEN YOU HAVE ENOUGH FOLLOWERS, YOU CAN MAKE THE LEADER OF YOUR PEOPLE INTO A HERO.  HE WILL THEN GO AROUND THE LAND YOU HAVE BUILT, LITERALLY TAKING STRENGTH FROM THE PEOPLE INTO HIMSELF, AND WORKING HIS WAY TOWARD THE ENEMY.  WHEN HE GETS THERE, HE WILL ENGAGE IN HOLY WARFARE UPON YOUR ENEMY'S PEOPLE.  HE WILL BURN; HE WILL KILL.  AND HE WON'T STOP UNTIL THEY'RE ALL DEAD... OR HE IS.

BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LET YOUR PEOPLE HAVE ALL THE FUN; THE GOD'S HAVE OTHER TOOLS AS WELL.  YOU CAN DROWN YOUR ENEMIES ONE AT A TIME WITH YOUR LAND LOWERING POWERS.  SUBMERGE THEIR TOWNS IN SWAMPS. RAISE A VOLCANO IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR BEST FARMLAND.  EVEN BETTER, YOU CAN FLOOD THE LAND AND DRAIN ALL THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T BUILD ON HIGH-GROUND. 

AND WHEN YOU WIN, YOU'LL HAVE 500 MORE WORLDS TO CONQUER.  A GOD'S PLAY IS JUST NEVER DONE.</desc>

		<name>Puzznic</name>
		<desc>THE CHALLENGE IN EACH LEVEL OF PUZZNIC IS TO MANEUVRE A SELECTION OF BLOCKS INTO PLACE SO AS TO CLEAR THEM ALL, BY MAKING THEM MAKE CONTACT WITH BLOCKS OF THE SAME DESIGN. YOU CONTROL A CROSS-HAIR, WHICH CAN MOVE A BLOCK LEFT OR RIGHT, WHICH CAN CAUSE IT TO FALL IF THERE IS NO BLOCK UNDER THE SPACE IT WOULD OCCUPY.

THERE ARE MANY COMPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF SOLVING THE LEVELS. MOVING PLATFORMS MEANING THAT YOU NEED TO MOVE A BLOCK AT A PARTICULAR TIME, OR IN PARTICULAR ORDER, TO PREVENT THEM BEING BLOCKADED. IN SOME SITUATIONS THERE ARE AN ODD NUMBER OF A CERTAIN TYPE OF BLOCK - SOLVING THESE REQUIRES POSITIONING TWO OF THE BLOCKS ONE SPACE APART, SUCH THAT A MOVE WILL RESULT IN A PIECE MAKING CONTACT WITH 2 OTHERS, AND IMMEDIATELY REMOVING ALL 3. YOU WILL ALSO ENCOUNTER BLOCKS POSITIONED ON PLATFORMS SUSPENDED IN SPACE AND GAPS IN LEVEL ARRANGEMENTS MEANING THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BLOCKS MUST BE IN PLACE TO MAKE A CERTAIN MOVE POSSIBLE (BY FORMING A STACK, FOR EXAMPLE)

THE GAME STRUCTURE IS SLIGHTLY UNUSUAL, AS AFTER YOU COMPLETE EACH BATCH OF FOUR LEVELS YOU GET A CHOICE OF 2 SETS OF LEVELS - YOU ARE PROGRESSING THROUGH AN EXPANDING MATRIX OF LEVELS, WHICH MEANS THERE ARE 2 SETS ON LEVEL 2, 3 ON LEVEL 3, 4 ON LEVEL 4, AND SO ON. THIS MEANS THAT THERE ARE A TOTAL OF 220 SCREENS IN THE GAME. EACH SCREEN IS PLAYED AGAINST A TIME LIMIT, AND LOSING A LEVEL (EITHER BY RUNNING OUT OF TIME, OR BY MAKING A POOR MOVE AND LEAVING AN IMPOSSIBLE POSITION) LOSES ONE OF YOUR 3 LIVES.</desc>

		<name>R-Type I</name>
		<desc>R-TYPE IS A SIDE SCROLLING SHOOT 'EM UP BEST KNOWN FOR ITS EXTREMELY TOUGH AND STRATEGIC GAMEPLAY.  YOU CONTROL THE R-9 SPACESHIP AS IT LAUNCHES A LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO REPEL THE EVIL BYDO EMPIRE.

THE R-9 COMES EQUIPPED AS STANDARD WITH A SMALL GUN WHICH CAN ONLY TAKE DOWN THE SMALLEST OF ENEMIES WITHOUT FIRING SEVERAL SHOTS. BY HOLDING DOWN THE FIRE BUTTON, IT CAN BE LOADED UP SO AS TO RELEASE A LARGE BURST OF ENERGY, ELIMINATING ALL BUT THE STRONGEST ENEMIES IN ITS PATH. FROM TIME TO TIME, PODS WILL COME FLYING IN YOUR DIRECTION. UPON BEING SHOT, THEY RELEASE AN UPGRADE. THE FIRST ONE WILL INVARIABLY BE THE ONE CALLED "THE FORCE", WHICH IS A WEAPONS POD THAT CLINGS EITHER TO THE FRONT OR THE BACK OF YOUR SHIP, ABSORBING ANY ENEMY BULLETS OR ACTING AS A BUMPER WITH WHICH YOU CAN FLY HEAD-ON INTO THEM. YOU CAN ALSO USE IT AS AN OFFENSIVE WEAPON BY FIRING IT AND PULLING IT BACK IN. MASTERING THE FORCE IS VITAL TO SURVIVING IN R-TYPE, SINCE IT MUST BE USED BOTH AS PROTECTION AGAINST BULLET CLUSTERS, AS A REMOTE CONTROLLED CANNON, AND IN ORDER TO CLEAR THE SCREEN FROM OBSTACLES. OTHER UPGRADES GIVE YOU TARGET-SEEKING MISSILES OR A BIGGER MAIN GUN. DIFFERENT GUN TYPES, DIFFERENTIATED BY THEIR COLOUR, SERVE DIFFERENT PURPOSES. THE BLUE ONE SENDS LASER BEAMS BOUNCING ACROSS THE SCREEN (GOOD FOR TUNNELS), THE RED ONE FIRES STRAIGHT AHEAD, AND THE YELLOW ONE FOLLOWS ANY WALLS IT MAY ENCOUNTER (GOOD FOR ARTILLERY EMPLACEMENTS).

THE STAGES OF R-TYPE ARE MADE IN AN ORGANIC STYLE, CERTAINLY INSPIRED BY H. R. GIGER'S ARTWORK FOR THE ALIEN MOVIES. WHEN IT CAME OUT, IT WAS CONSIDERED TREND-SETTING SINCE IT BROKE OFF FROM THE STEREOTYPICAL SCI-FI MOULD OF OTHER SHOOT'EM'UPS. IN PART, THE LEVELS THEMSELVES ARE YOUR ENEMY, WHICH IS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE FOURTH, WHERE SPIDER-LIKE CREATURES WEAVE WEBS THAT COVER THE SCREEN AND BLOCK YOUR PATH, OR LEVELS WITH INTRICATE TUNNEL SYSTEMS. STILL, THE LEVELS ARE BEST HANDLED WITH A COMBINATION OF STRATEGY AND REFLEXES, WITHOUT THE MEMORISATION THAT IS REQUIRED OF R-TYPE'S CONTEMPORARY RIVAL, GRADIUS.</desc>

USING A HEAVY-DESIGNED MACHINE WITH A V6 DOHC 3000CC TWIN TURBO ENGINE, FIVE SETS OF NITRO-FUEL BOOSTS, AND A GUN ATTACHED TO THE STEERING WHEEL (WHICH YOU CAN USE TO DAMAGE THE TARGET VEHICLE), YOUR MISSION IS TO PATROL THE STREETS AND FIND THESE VEHICLES.

THE GAMEPLAY IS SIMILAR TO CHASE H.Q., BUT THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENCES. FOR EXAMPLE, CARS TRAVEL IN BOTH DIRECTIONS INSTEAD OF ONE, AND SOME OF THEM WILL CATCH UP TO YOUR CAR AND SHOOT AT YOU. AT LEAST ONCE IN EVERY STAGE A HELICOPTER DOES A FLY BY AND DROPS YOU SOME GRENADES YOU CAN USE TO FURTHER DAMAGE THE TARGET VEHICLE. A GUY ON A MOTORCYCLE WILL CATCH UP TO YOU AND THROW GRENADES AT YOUR CAR. AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, AS MENTIONED EARLIER, YOU CAN SHOOT AT THE TARGET VEHICLE RATHER THAN JUST BUMPING INTO IT.

HAVE FUN DRIVING AROUND, BUT REMEMBER, THERE IS A STRICT TIME LIMIT, SO I WOULDN'T WASTE TIME OR KEEP CRASHING INTO THINGS IF I WERE YOU.</desc>

		<desc>SADAKICHI SEVEN: HIDEYOSHI NO OUGON IS A MENU-DRIVEN ADVENTURE GAME THAT FOCUSES ON A SILLY JAMES BOND STYLE STORY OF AN EVIL ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS N.A.T.T.O. (NATTO IS A REGIONAL JAPANESE DISH) AND A CHEF-LIKE SPY DETERMINED TO STOP THEM. SEVERAL ALLUSIONS TO THE 007 FRANCHISE ARE MADE THROUGHOUT THE GAME, INCLUDING AN OPENING CUTSCENE VIEWED FROM THE BARREL OF A GUN AND THE HERO CASUALLY TOSSING HIS HAT ONTO A HAT RACK AS THE GAME BEGINS.

BESIDES THE ODD NARRATIVE ELEMENTS, IT PLAYS MUCH LIKE ANY PORTOPIA-DERIVED ADVENTURE GAME: THE PLAYER CAN INTERACT WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENT THROUGH A LIST OF COMMANDS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND THE GOAL IS TO TALK TO NPCS, EXPLORE THE SURROUNDINGS AND DISCOVER CLUES IN ORDER TO SOLVE A MYSTERY.</desc>

		<name>Shiryou Sensen : War of the Dead</name>
		<desc>THIS VERSION OF SHIRY SENSEN: WAR OF THE DEAD CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A CROSS BETWEEN THE MSX AND THE PC-88 RELEASES. 

SIMILARLY TO THE ORIGINAL MSX RELEASE, GUNS REQUIRE AMMUNITION, BATTLES HAVE BACKGROUNDS, SEVERAL ENEMIES MAY ATTACK AT ONCE, AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO LEAVE THE SIDE-SCROLLING BATTLE AREA (WHICH BECAME LARGER IN THIS RELEASE) BY WALKING TO ITS EDGE. HOWEVER, MAP LAYOUT AND LOCATIONS ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH THOSE OF THE PC-88 VERSION, HENCE BEING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE MSX RELEASE.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE - WHICH IS UNIQUE TO THIS VERSION - IS THE ADDITION OF A RPG SYSTEM. WHEREAS IN THE TWO OTHER VERSIONS THE BATTLES DIDN'T SERVE ANY OTHER PURPOSE BUT CHALLENGE THE PLAYER AND IMPEDE THE PROGRESS OF THE STORY, IN THE PC ENGINE (TURBOGRAFX-16) RELEASE THEY ARE ESSENTIAL TO LAILA'S CHARACTER GROWTH. LIKE IN MOST RPGS, LAILA CAN NOW GAIN LEVELS, WHICH ENHANCE HER PARAMETERS AND MAKE HER STRONGER IN COMBAT. WHEN DEFEATED, ENEMIES LEAVE ORBS OF VARIOUS COLORS AND CHESTS; THESE SERVE TO HEAL LAILA, GRANT HER EXPERIENCE POINTS, "MIND POINTS" (TO REPLENISH HER PSYCHIC ABILITIES), OR AMMUNITION FOR THE FIREARMS.</desc>

RICK AND HIS GIRLFRIEND JENNIFER ENTER WEST MANSION (KNOWN AS SPLATTERHOUSE) TO STUDY DR. WEST'S PARAPSYCHOLOGY TEACHINGS FOR A SCHOOL PROJECT.  AFTER A FLASH OF LIGHTNING AND A SCREAM, JENNIFER IS GONE, AND RICK IS LEFT WEARING THE TERROR MASK, WHICH GIVES THE WEARER GREAT STRENGTH.

RICK MUST SURVIVE SEVEN BLOOD-SOAKED LEVELS FULL OF CORPSES, DEMONS, AND OTHER DISTURBING CREATURES IN THIS ARCADE SIDE-SCROLLING BEAT-EM-UP. SEVERAL WEAPONS ARE AT RICK'S DISPOSAL THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE, SUCH AS A MEAT CLEAVER, A TWO BY FOUR, AND A SHOTGUN. IF RICK WANTS TO FIND JENNIFER ALIVE, HE MUST MOVE QUICKLY THROUGH THE FLOORS OF THE MANSION.... AS A HAPPY REUNION IS NOT ALWAYS GUARANTEED.</desc>

THE GAMES FOCUS ON EACH PLAYER'S BURGEONING REAL ESTATE CORPORATION, ALLOWING THE PLAYERS TO TAKE TURNS AND MOVE THEIR TRAINS AROUND THE BOARD TO BUY PROPERTIES AND TRADE RESOURCES. IT PLAYS SIMILARLY TO THE PARKER BROTHERS BOARD GAME MONOPOLY OR THE ITADAKI STREET GAMES.</desc>

		<name>Susanoou Densetsu</name>
		<desc>THE GAME IS BASED ON THE EPONYMOUS MANGA (SOMETIMES TRANSLITERATED AS SUSA NO OH) BY  GO NAGAI. THE PROTAGONIST IS A SEEMINGLY ORDINARY TEENAGER NAMED SUSA, WHO DISCOVERS THAT HE CONTAINS WITHIN HIMSELF ANOTHER PERSONA, THE DESTRUCTIVE JAPANESE GOD SUSANOO. THE GAME'S STORY BEGINS RIGHT WHERE THE MANGA ENDED (WITH A CLIFFHANGER): SUSA FACES HIS RIVAL URYU, WHO CAUSES HIM TO UNLEASH THE POWER OF SUSANOO, DEVASTATING THE WORLD AND RELEASING EVIL SPIRITS THAT TAKE IT IN THEIR POSSESSION. HAVING RETURNED TO HIS NORMAL SELF, SUSA HAS TO FIND HIS SWEETHEART YUKISHIRO AND OTHER FRIENDS, AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO UNDO THE DAMAGE HE HAS INFLICTED ON THE WORLD.

SUSANO? DENSETSU IS NOTABLE FOR IMPLEMENTING A SETTING AND GAMEPLAY THEMES UNUSUAL FOR JAPANESE RPGS OF ITS TIME. AMONG THOSE IS A DAY/NIGHT CYCLE, WHICH INFLUENCES THE APPEARANCE OF MONSTERS ON THE WORLD MAP AS WELL AS SCHEDULES OF CHARACTERS IN THE TOWNS (FOR EXAMPLE, SHOPS ARE CLOSED AT NIGHT). IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE FIRST JAPANESE RPGS IN WHICH ENEMIES WANDER AROUND VISIBLY ON THE WORLD MAP, SOMETIMES SURROUNDING THE PLAYER,  ULTIMA-STYLE, AND CAN BE AVOIDED.

THE BATTLE SYSTEM IS ALSO REMINISCENT OF ULTIMA, FEATURING FREE MOVEMENT ON THE TOP-DOWN BATTLE SCREEN. THE FIGHTS ARE HELD IN FAST-PACED TURN-BASED STYLE; TO PAUSE THE FIGHT, THE PLAYER HAS TO BRING UP THE MENU AND SELECT A COMMAND. SIMILARLY TO  EMERALD DRAGON, ACTION POINTS ARE SPENT WHEN MOVING AND/OR SELECTING COMMANDS.

LATER IN THE GAME SUSA TEAMS UP WITH TWO OTHER CHARACTERS; HE CAN ALSO RECRUIT MERCENARIES TO HELP HIM IN BATTLES. CHARACTERS LEARN THE SO-CALLED "ESP POWERS" WHEN LEVELING UP, WHICH ARE EQUIVALENT TO MAGIC SPELLS.</desc>

EVERYONE WHO WAS INVITED TO THE WEDDING BEGINS TO CELEBRATE WHEN, SUDDENLY, THE EVIL BARON BRONSKY APPEARS AND SNATCHES TINA AWAY, WHILE HIS HENCHMEN TAKE THE SIX CHILDREN AWAY. TO REACH HIS CASTLE AND RESCUE TINA, MASTER HIGGINS MUST FIRST RESCUE THE SIX CHILDREN, EACH OF WHOM IS HIDDEN ON A SEPARATE ISLAND.

NEW ADVENTURE ISLAND IS A ONE-PLAYER ACTION GAME THAT CONSISTS OF SEVEN AREAS, WITH FOUR ROUNDS EACH. IN ORDER TO GET THROUGH THE AREAS, YOU MUST USE YOUR HATCHET TO DESTROY WILDLIFE SUCH AS FROGS, SPIDERS, BIRDS, SNAILS, INSECTS, AND OTHER PESTS, AND WATCH OUT FOR HAZARDS SUCH AS ROCKS, FIRE, WATER, AND PITS. 

AS YOU PROGRESS FURTHER, YOUR VITALITY WILL GET LOW, SO FRUIT MUST BE COLLECTED IN ORDER TO RESTORE IT. ALONG THE WAY, YOU CAN SMASH OPEN EGGS THAT WILL AWARD YOU WITH BETTER WEAPONS THAT INCLUDE BOOMERANGS, ARROWS, AND MAGICAL FIRE. SOME OF THE EGGS WILL ALSO REVEAL A FAIRY, WHICH WILL PROTECT YOU FROM GETTING HIT. IF YOU ARE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND AN EGGPLANT HIDDEN IN ONE OF THESE EGGS, YOUR VITALITY WILL DRAIN AWAY VERY FAST, AND YOU NEED TO GET FRUIT EVERY FIVE SECONDS IN ORDER TO SURVIVE.

WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF AN AREA, YOU WILL HAVE TO DEFEAT ONE OF THE HENCHMEN AND RESCUE A CHILD FROM ONE OF THE FOUR CASTLES.

		<desc>ONE DAY, A KIWI TRIBE WAS HAVING FUN AND GAMES OUTSIDE THE ZOO, ONLY TO BE KIDNAPPED BY THE EVIL-MINDED LEOPARD SEAL, WHO PLANS TO SELL THEM AT THE BLACK MARKET. FORTUNATELY, DURING THE KIDNAPPING PROCESS, TIKI, LEADER OF THE TRIBE, MANAGED TO ESCAPE THE SACK, AND HER JOB IS TO RESCUE PHEE-PHEE AND THE OTHER KIWIS SCATTERED AROUND NEW ZEALAND, AND ARE HELD IN CAGES IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS THAT INCLUDE AUCKLAND, ROTORUA, WAITOMO CAVES, STRAIT COOK, AND MT. COOK. 

IF TIKI DOESN'T RESCUE A KIWI IN A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME, THE DEVIL WILL APPEAR AND TRY TO KILL HER. WHEN TIKI REACHES THE OUTSKIRTS OF EACH CITY, EXCEPT STRAIT COOK, THERE IS A BOSS WAITING TO MEET TIKI, AND KILL HER BY USING THEIR OWN CHOICE OF WEAPONS. ALSO MAKING THE RESCUE MISSION DIFFICULT ARE SEVERAL NASTIES THAT ATTEMPT TO THROW THEIR OWN WEAPONS, LIKE BOMBS AND ARROWS, AT HER. TO DEFEAT THESE ENEMIES, TIKI SHOOTS AT THEM USING HER CROSSBOW AND ARROWS. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, WHEN TIKI SHOOTS AT ENEMIES, THEY WILL LEAVE BEHIND PIECES OF FRUIT THAT SHE CAN PICK UP FOR POINTS. HOWEVER, IT IS LIKELY THAT TIKI MAY GET OTHER WEAPONS OR THE LETTERS E, X, T, E, N, AND D. COLLECTING ALL THESE LETTERS WILL RESULT IN AN EXTRA LIFE, AND AS FOR THE WEAPONS, THEY INCLUDE LASER SHOTS, BOMBS, AND FIREBALLS. 

IN SOME LEVELS, A FEW AREAS ARE LOCATED FURTHER UP THAN JUST LEFT OR RIGHT, AND THE ONLY WAY THAT TIKI CAN GO UP IS BY SNATCHING SOMETHING OFF THE ENEMY THAT GIVES HER THE ABILITY TO FLY UP. OTHER AREAS ARE UNDERWATER, AND WHEN TIKI GOES UNDERWATER, HER OXYGEN  METER DECREASES, SO SHE HAS TO RISE UP TO THE SURFACE AGAIN TO RESTORE HER OXYGEN LEVELS. APART FROM HER OWN WEAPONS, TIKI IS ABLE TO SQUIRT WATER AT ENEMIES IF SHE GETS TO THE TOP OF THE WATER.</desc>

		<desc>THE NINJA WARRIORS IS A ONE OR TWO PLAYER SIDE-SCROLLING BEAT-EM-UP. THE TAITO COIN-OP FEATURED THREE MONITOR SCREENS SIDE BY SIDE, WHILE THE AMIGA VERSION WAS DEVELOPED IN LETTERBOX FORMAT IN ORDER TO SHOW AS MUCH OF THE WIDE SCREEN BACKGROUND GRAPHICS AS POSSIBLE. 

THE PLAYER(S) CONTROL ROBOT NINJAS, WHICH BATTLE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE LEVELS USING SHURIKEN AND KNIVES. AS THE NINJA'S TAKE DAMAGE THEIR CLASSIC NINJA GARB IS TORN AWAY TO REVEAL ROBOTIC LIMBS, TORSO OR HEAD. WHEN THE DAMAGE REACHES A CRITICAL LEVEL THE NINJA ROBOT EXPLODES SCATTERING MECHANICAL BODY PARTS.

AS WITH THE SALES CURVE'S LATER TITLE SWIV, THE NINJA WARRIORS USES THE COMPANY'S DYNAMIC LOADING SYSTEM TO LOAD SPRITES, SOUND AND BACKGROUND GRAPHICS FROM DISK ON THE FLY.</desc>

		<desc>TITAN IS A 2D ARCADE GAME / PUZZLE GAME HYBRID.

FOR SOME REASON, MAD PROFESSORS OF THE FUTURE TEND TO INVENT STRANGE ENTERTAINMENT GAMES IN WHICH EVERY PARTICIPANT DIES. PROFESSOR HYBRYS VARIANT IS CALLED TITAN AND INVOLVES A BALL, A CONTROL UNIT AND 80 LABYRINTHS. YOUR OBJECTIVE IS EITHER TO DESTROY ALL DESTRUCTIBLE BLOCKS IN EACH LEVEL BY HITTING THEM WITH THE SPHERE, OR TO PILOT IT TO THE EXIT. THE BLACK BALL IS BEYOND YOUR CONTROL; IT WILL BOUNCE STRAIGHT OR DIAGONALLY THROUGH THE LABYRINTH WITH CONSTANT SPEED. YOU MOVE THE CONTROL UNIT, A SMALL BOX, WITH YOU ARE TO POSITION IN A WAY THAT THE BALL BOUNCES OFF IT IN THE DESIRED DIRECTION. YOU CAN ALSO CATCH THE SPHERE BY QUICKLY MOVING OVER IT, AND THEN RELEASE IT IN A DIRECTION OF YOUR CHOICE.

THE LABYRINTHS NOT ONLY CONTAIN HARMLESS, DESTRUCTIBLE BLOCKS, BUT ALSO INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT HAZARDS. IF THE SPHERE OR YOUR CONTROL UNIT HIT A SKULL SYMBOL, ONE OF YOUR NINE LIVES IS LOST. TELEPORTERS EXCHANGE THE POSITION OF YOU AND THE BALL, WALL PIECES CAN BE PUSHED AROUND OR DESTROYED BY YOUR UNIT, FLOOR TILES WILL GROW INTO WALLS WHEN YOU PASS OVER THEM TOO OFTEN. THE HIGH GAME SPEED CAN BE SLOWED DOWN BY HOLDING THE SPACE KEY  A VERY USEFUL OPTION IN TRICKY SITUATIONS.

TITAN MIXES AN ARCADE GAME FOUNDATION (REQUIRING QUICK REFLEXES AND GOOD NERVES) WITH PUZZLE GAME ELEMENTS (REQUIRING LOGICAL THINKING TO BEAT THE COMPLEX LEVELS). THE CHALLENGE IS TO CONTROL THE SPHERE ACCURATELY, YET INDIRECTLY.</desc>

THE GAME OFFERS EXHIBITION MATCHES AND A TOURNAMENT MODE, EIGHT INTERNATIONAL TEAMS (EACH WITH UNIQUE PLAYER STATISTICS), AND SUPPORT FOR UP TWO FIVE PLAYERS VIA THE TURBOTAP.

AFTER A DRAMATIC CLOSE-UP OF THE FACE-OFF, ACTUAL GAME PLAY IS SEEN FROM A TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE WITH A VERTICALLY SCROLLING FIELD. EVERY PLAYER (INCLUDING THE GOALIE) CAN BE CONTROLLED. ON OFFENSE, QUICK SHOTS, SLAP SHOTS AND EVEN FAKED SLAP SHOTS ARE POSSIBLE. ON DEFENSE, BODY CHECKING AN OPPOSING PLAYER CAN LEAD TO A SPECIAL FIGHT SEQUENCE.

EXHIBITION GAMES CAN BE PLAYED WITH EITHER FULL OR EASY RULES - EASY MODE HAS LESS PENALTIES AND INFRACTIONS LIKE OFFSIDE. IN TOURNAMENTS, EVERY SCHEDULED GAME CAN EITHER BE PLAYED OR THE RESULTS SIMULATED. TOURNAMENT PROGRESS IS SAVED VIA A PASSWORD. WHEN TWO OR MORE PLAYERS PLAY, THEY CAN BE PUT ON ANY TEAM. THUS TEAMS FEATURING FIVE HUMAN PLAYERS ARE JUST AS POSSIBLE AS MIXED COMPETITIVE MATCHES.</desc>

		<desc>TAKIN' IT TO THE HOOP IS A BASKETBALL GAME WITH COMIC GRAPHICS. THE PLAYER EITHER PARTICIPATES IN A LEAGUE, PLAY-OFFS OR A SINGLE MATCH AND CHOOSES ONE OF EIGHT AMERICAN TEAMS WITH TWELVE ATHLETES. THE TEAM'S PERFORMANCE DURING A MATCH DOES NOT ONLY DEPEND ON THE PLAYER'S ABILITY BUT ALSO ON THE ATHLETHE'S STATISTICS (E.G. AGILITY OR DRIBBLING) AND THEIR ENERGY. ENERGY DECREASES DURING THE COURSE OF A MATCH AND DESCRIBES HOW MUCH POWER AN ATHLETE HAS LEFT. THERE ARE ALSO THREE DIFFERENT DEFENSE TACTICS (ONE-ON-ONE DEFENSE, ZONE DEFENSE OR A MIX BETWEEN THE TWO) WHICH CAN BE SET BEFORE THE MATCH OR DURING INTERCEPTIONS.

DURING THE MATCHES, THE PLAYER CONTROLS THE BALL CARRIER WHEN IN OFFENSE AND MANUALLY SWITCHES BETWEEN ATHLETES WHEN IN DEFENSE. PASSES CAN BE PERFORMED IN A HIGH OR LOW VARIATION. WHILE MOST OF THE MATCH IS SHOWN IN A SLIGHTLY HEIGHTENED SIDE-SCROLLING PERSPECTIVE, THE GAME SWITCHES TO A CLOSE-UP VIEW DURING A PENALTY THROW OR A DUNKING TRY. HERE THE PLAYER NEEDS TO PRESS A BUTTON AT THE CORRECT TIMING FOR A SUCCESSFUL THROW. WHEN A DEFENSE ATHLETE IS NEARBY DURING A DURING MANEUVER, HE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BLOCK THE BALL WHEN THE CORRECT TIMING IS MET.</desc>

THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL DIFFERENT POWERUPS YOU CAN PICK UP SUCH AS MISSILES AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF LASERS.

THE PLOT IN THE GAME IS NOT REAL CLEAR ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTION BOOKLET. APPARENTLY SOMETHING CALLED A "SINISTRON" HAS INVADED YOUR QUADRANT OF THE GALAXY AND YOU HAVE TO BLOW IT UP, JUST BECAUSE.

THIS GAME HAS LARGE ENEMY SPRITES AND LARGE BOSS CHARACTERS. THE LEVELS TAKE PLACE MOSTLY IN OUTER SPACE AND ALIEN ENVIRONMENTS. SOME OF THE SPRITES ARE MACROSS-LIKE MECHS.

THE JAPANESE VERSION, "VIOLENT SOLDIER", HAD SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT GRAPHICS.</desc>

		<name>Volfied</name>
		<desc>VOLFIED IS A HOME CONVERSION OF AN ARCADE COIN-OP DEVELOPED BY TAITO IN THE LATE '80S. THE GAME IS VERY SIMILAR TO QIX -- THE PLAYER TAKES CONTROL OF AN OBJECT WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO ROAM THE SCREEN, FORMING SHAPES AND REMOVING THEM FROM THE PLAY FIELD. BY WAY OF REWARD, A PICTURE IS GRADUALLY REVEALED IN THE REMOVED AREAS OF THE SCREEN. THE BORDERS OF THE AREA WHICH THE PLAYER HAS NOT CLEARED BECOME THE BORDER OF THE AREA THE PLAYER'S POINTER CAN MOVE ALONG.

THE PLAYER'S OBJECT MUST AVOID CONTACT WITH ANY OF THE ENEMIES WHICH FLOAT AROUND THE SCREEN, AS THIS WILL WEAKEN AND EVENTUALLY DESTROY IT. BARRIERS LIMIT WHICH PARTS OF THE BORDER BOXES CAN BE FORMED THROUGH. THE GOAL IS TO CLEAR 80% OR MORE OF THE SCREEN, AND EACH ADDITIONAL PERCENT ADDS BONUS POINTS.

AS AN ARCADE CONVERSION THIS GAME ALLOWS FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYER GAMES IN THREE DIFFICULTY LEVELS, BUT OFFERS NO PASSWORDS OR SAVED GAMES ACROSS ITS NUMEROUS LEVELS.</desc>
