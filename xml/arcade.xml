		<desc>"1942" IS A VERTICALLY-SCROLLING SHOOT-EM-UP SET IN THE PACIFIC THEATRE DURING WORLD WAR II, IN WHICH THE GOAL IS TO REACH TOKYO AND DESTROY THE ENTIRE JAPANESE AIR FLEET. 

THE PLAYER PILOTS A PLANE DUBBED THE "SUPER ACE" (ITS APPEARANCE IS THAT OF A LOCKHEED P-38 LIGHTNING) AND HAS TO SHOOT DOWN WAVES OF ENEMY PLANES WHILE AVOIDING INCOMING ENEMY FIRE. THE 'SUPER ACE' CAN PERFORM A LIMITED NUMBER OF ROLLS OR 'LOOP-THE-LOOPS' TO EVADE ENEMY PLANES AND SHOTS. 

DURING THE GAME, WAVES OF RED ENEMY PLANES PERIODICALLY APPEAR. IF THE PLAYER MANAGES TO DESTROY A RED WAVE, A POWER-UP, IN THE FORM OF A 'POW' SYMBOL, WILL BE DROPPED AND CAN BE PICKED UP. THE POWER-UP WILL AWARD EITHER INCREASED FIRE-POWER (DOUBLING THE PLAYER'S GUNS FROM TWO TO FOUR), A SMART BOMB THAT DESTROYS ALL ON-SCREEN ENEMY PLANES THE INSTANT IT'S COLLECTED, TWO WINGMEN PLANES THAT FLANK THE SUPER ACE AND INCREASE FIRE POWER, OR SIMPLY EXTRA POINTS.

AT THE END OF EACH STAGE THE 'SUPER ACE' LANDS ON AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER AND BONUS POINTS ARE AWARDED BASED ON PLAYER PERFORMANCE. "1942" DIFFERS FROM OTHER GAMES IN THAT ITS LEVELS ARE NUMBERED IN REVERSE ORDER, SO THE GAME BEGINS AT STAGE 32 AND ENDS AT STAGE 1.</desc>

		<desc>THE GAME IS SET IN THE PACIFIC THEATER OF WORLD WAR II, OFF THE COAST OF THE MIDWAY ATOLL. THE GOAL IS TO ATTACK THE JAPANESE AIR FLEET THAT BOMBED THE PLAYERS' AMERICAN AIRCRAFT CARRIER, PURSUE ALL JAPANESE AIR AND SEA FORCES, FLY THROUGH THE 16 LEVELS OF PLAY, MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE JAPANESE BATTLESHIP YAMATO AND DESTROY HER. 11 LEVELS CONSIST OF AN AIR-TO-SEA BATTLE (WITH A HUGE BATTLESHIP OR AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER AS AN END-LEVEL BOSS), WHILE 5 LEVELS CONSIST OF AN ALL-AERIAL BATTLE AGAINST A SQUADRON OF JAPANESE BOMBERS AND A MOTHER BOMBER THAT NEEDS TO BE DESTROYED.
AS IN 1942, PLAYERS PILOT A P-38. TWO BUTTONS ARE USED: ONE FOR REGULAR ATTACKS (WITH SEVERAL WEAPONS) AND ONE FOR SPECIAL ACTIONS THAT EXECUTES EITHER A LOOP LIKE IN 1942 OR ONE OF THREE SPECIAL ATTACKS THAT DAMAGE THE PLANE. UNLIKE 1942, THE PLAYER ONLY HAS ONE LIFE, WITH ONE REFILLABLE ENERGY METER. DESTROYING A COMPLETE FORMATION OF RED ENEMY PLANES WILL RESULT IN A POWER-UP, SUCH AS A HEALTH BOOST OR A TEMPORARY SPECIAL WEAPONS WHICH REPLACES THE DEFAULT TWIN GUN.</desc>

NO ENTANTO, A VERDADE É QUE A ASSOCIAÇÃO USOU UMA SOMA COLOSSAL DE DINHEIRO PARA PROMOVER O SUPER BASEBALL COMO SHOW BUSINESS. ELES MANIPULARAM A HABILIDADE DE CADA JOGADOR USANDO O COMPUTADOR DE CONTROLE PARA DECIDIR SECRETAMENTE A VITÓRIA OU A DERROTA EM CADA JOGO. OS JOGADORES QUE CONHECIAM ISSO REMOVERAM AS PARTES DE CONEXÃO DO COMPUTADOR PARA JOGAR SEU PRÓPRIO JOGO DE BASEBALL. FINALMENTE, UM JOGO JUSTO SERÁ JOGADO NO CYBER EGG STADIUM.

EM 2020, O SUPER BASEBALL É UM JOGO ACELERADO COM NOVAS REGRAS, ONDE VOCÊ PODE SELECIONAR 1 DE 12 HOMENS, MULHERES OU JOGADORES DE ROBÔS. DURANTE O JOGO, VOCÊ PODE FORTALECER SUA EQUIPE COM OS PRÊMIOS OBTIDOS DE CAPTURAS SURPREENDENTES.</desc>

		<desc>A ONE OR TWO-PLAYER ARCADE GAME WITH PLAYERS TAKING ON THE ROLE OF A SKATEBOARDER, AND MUST PERFORM VARIOUS TRICKS AND MANEUVERS TO EARN THE POINTS AND TICKETS NEEDED TO COMPETE FOR MEDALS IN THE GAME'S NUMEROUS SKATE PARKS. 

THE BULK OF THE ACTION TAKES PLACE IN A 'SKATE CITY', A SMALL URBAN AREA MADE UP OF RAMPS, JUMPS AND HAZARDS. PLAYERS CAN SKATE ANYWHERE THEY WISH AS THEY PERFORM THE TRICKS AND JUMPS NEEDED TO REACH THE SCORE THRESHOLDS THAT WILL EARN THEM ENTRY TICKETS TO SKATE CITY'S SKATE PARKS TO COMPETE FOR MEDALS AND CASH PRIZES. 

EACH SCORE THRESHOLD MUST BE REACHED AND A PARK ENTERED WITHIN A TIGHT TIME LIMIT. FAILURE TO DO SO SEES THE SKATER PERSUED BY A SWARM OF BEES AND THE WORDS SKATE OR DIE APPEAR. SHOULD THE BEES TOUCH THE SKATER BEFORE HE ENTERS A PARK, THE GAME ENDS. SKATE CITY'S ROADS AND PAVEMENTS ARE POPULATED WITH MOVING TRAFFIC AND PEDESTRIANS AND ANY COLLISION WITH THEM WILL RESULT IN THE SKATER BEING KNOCKED FROM HIS BOARD, COSTING THE PLAYER PRECIOUS SECONDS. 

THE PARKS THEMSELVES EACH FEATURE ONE OF FOUR DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES: SLALOM, JUMP, DOWNHILL AND RAMP. EACH PARK HAS A TIMER AND PLAYERS CAN EARN EITHER A BRONZE, SILVER OR GOLD MEDAL - TOGETHER WITH A CASH PRIZE - DEPENDING ON HOW QUICKLY THE PARK IS COMPLETED. IF THE PARK TARGET SCORE OR FINISH LINE IS NOT REACHED BEFORE THE TIMER EXPIRES, NO MEDAL OR MONEY IS AWARDED. 

MONEY WON CAN BE USED TO BUY EQUIPMENT UPGRADES FROM THE STALLS THAT LITTER SKATE CITY. PLAYERS CAN BUY UPGRADED BOARDS, HELMETS, PADS AND SHOES. BOARDS GIVE FASTER SPEED; HELMETS ALLOW FOR MORE RISKY MANEUVERS; PADS GIVE A FASTER RECOVERY FROM FALLS AND SHOES PROVIDE MORE HEIGHT ON JUMPS, AS WELL AS GIVING A QUICKER STANDING START. 

AT THE START OF EACH NEW GAME, PLAYERS CAN SELECT FROM ONE OF TWO PLAY MODES. 'TRAINING LEVEL' IS AVAILABLE FOR BEGINNERS AND GIVES PLAYERS NUMEROUS PLAYING HINTS AND TIPS. 'EXPERIENCED LEVEL' IS MORE CHALLENGING AS WELL AS OFFERING FEWER HINTS. IT DOES, HOWEVER, INCLUDE THE 'ADD-A-COIN' FEATURE, WHICH ALLOWS FOR AWARDS AND ITEMS ALREADY WON TO BE CARRIED OVER TO A NEW GAME. 

THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO COMPETE IN AS MANY SKATE PARKS AS POSSIBLE. THERE ARE NUMEROUS CITY HAZARDS TO BE AVOIDED, SUCH AS BMX RIDERS, CARS, FRISBEE THROWERS AND OTHER SKATERS. TO GUIDE THE PLAYER AROUND SKATE CITY ARE MAP TILES. RIDING OVER ONE OF THESE WILL TEMPORAILY PAUSE THE ACTION AND DISPLAY THE LAYOUT OF THE CITY, INCLUDING THE LOCATIONS OF THE SKATE PARKS AND EQUIPMENT STALLS.</desc>

		<name>Acrobat Mission</name>
		<desc>A GREAT VERTICAL SCROLLING SHOOT'EM UP GAME.

AT THE YEAR 2100 A.D. HUMANS WERE EXTERMINATED BY THEIR OWN SELF-DESTRUCTIVE NATURE LEAVING BEHIND THE CONSEQUENCES OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION ON EARTH AND WERE FORCED TO ESCAPE TO MARS LEAVING A BIO-COMPUTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RECUPERATION OF EARTH TO PREPARING THE BLUE PLANET FOR FUTURE RECOLONIZATION. BUT ONE DAY A HALF A CENTURY AFTER HUMANS ARRIVED, MARS WAS ATTACKED BY STRANGE FLYING OBJECTS. TO FIGHT THESE ENEMIES, THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE DEFENCE AGENCY ORGANIZED THE TASK FORCE ARMY AND STARTED QUICKLY THE DOGFIGHT WITH INVADERS TO NEUTRALIZE THE INVASION. 

THE OPERATION WAS CALLED 'ACROBAT MISSION' AS IT EXCEEDED THE TECHNICAL LIMITS OF THE PILOTS.

THE PLAYERS TAKES CONTROLS ON ONE OF TWO SURVIVING FIGHTERS PILOTS, 'JET' A MALE PILOT AND 'NOVA' A FEMALE PILOT AND BOTH FLYING THE ICARUS, A FAST AND POWERFUL SPACE-FIGHTER, WHICH COMES EQUIPPED WITH A STANDARD LASER. TWO MORE WEAPONS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE GAME - THE WIDE SHOT (W) WHICH SPREADS OUT IN FRONT OF THE SHIP AND THE HURRICANE SHOT (H) WHICH FIRES CLUSTERS OF ROTATING BALLS OF ENERGY. HOLDING THE FIRE BUTTON CHARGES UP A SPECIAL ATTACK AND EACH WEAPON FEATURES A DIFFERENT ENERGY BLAST AND DAMAGE FACTOR. THE SHIPS CAN ALSO HOLD A MAXIMUM OF TWO SMART-BOMBS, ONE UNDER EACH WING - ALTHOUGH THEY CAN BE ACTIVATED BY THE PLAYERS, THEY ALSO DO FALL OFF EASILY AND CAN BE DETONATED BY ENEMY SHOTS. INTERESTINGLY, THE ICARUS CAN'T COLLIDE WITH OTHER SHIPS OR ANY PART OF THE SCENERY - INSTEAD, IT BOUNCES OFF AND ONLY SUFFERS DAMAGE FROM ENEMY SHOTS. HOWEVER, ONCE THE SHIELD IS DEPLETED, THE SHIP WILL FLY OUT OF CONTROL FOR A FEW SECONDS AND GRANT THE PLAYERS A LAST CHANCE TO INFLICT DAMAGE TO ANY REMAINING ENEMIES BEFORE IT EXPLODES.</desc>

PLAYERS MUST FIGHT THEIR WAY THROUGH 21 COLOURFUL, FAST-MOVING STAGES, SHOOTING DOWN WAVES OF ENEMY FIGHTERS WHILE AVOIDING THE ENEMY'S INCOMING MISSILES. THE F14 IS EQUIPPED WITH A MACHINE GUN AND A LIMITED NUMBER OF HOMING MISSILES. THE GUN HAS INFINITE AMMUNITION AND TARGETING IS ACHIEVED BY MANEUVERING THE TOMCAT SO THAT THE TARGETING CURSOR SITUATED JUST IN FRONT OF THE JET IS PLACED OVER AN ENEMY FIGHTER. 

AFTER BURNER'S STRAIGHTFORWARD SHOOT-EM-UP GAMEPLAY IS SIMPLE AND REPETITIVE, BUT THE GAME'S INCREDIBLE VISUALS ENSURED ITS SUCCESS.</desc>

IN AIR BUSTER, THE PLAYER CONTROLS A FIGHTER JET ALSO DESIGNED FOR SPACE TRAVEL AND SHOOTS ENEMIES, COLLECTS POWER-UPS, AND DEFEATS BOSSES TO ADVANCE LEVELS. PLAYERS CHOOSE BETWEEN ONE OF THE TWO BLASTER FIGHTERS THROUGH SCROLLING SIX STAGES. THE BLASTER FIGHTERS CAN EQUIP ONE OF SEVEN WEAPONS. THE WEAPONS INCLUDE THE STRIKER WEAPON WHICH ADDS ADDITIONAL FIREPOWER THROUGH VERTICALLY ALIGNED OPTIONS, THE REVERSE SHOT WHICH FIRES TWO DIAGONAL SHOTS FROM THE REAR OF THE SHIP, THE SIX WAY SHOT WHICH FIRES SEMI-AUTOMATIC SHOTS IN SIX DIRECTIONS AND THE HOMING SHOT WHICH TRACKS ENEMIES ALL AROUND THE SCREEN. THE OTHER THREE WEAPONS ARE MISSILE BASED WHICH VARY FROM RED STRAIGHT-FIRING ROCKETS AND GREEN HOMING MISSILES. THERE IS ALSO THE BORDER ITEM WHICH SURROUNDS THE FRONT OF THE SHIP, KEEPING IT FROM CRASHING INTO FOREGROUND OBJECTS. THE ONLY OTHER ITEMS INCLUDE POWER-UPS WHICH INCREASE THE SHIP'S STANDARD SHOT POWER AND BONUS POINTS THAT APPEAR IN THE SIGN OF DOLLAR SIGNS.</desc>

		<name>Air Duel</name>
		<desc>THE PLAYER SELECTS FROM A JET FIGHTER OR HELICOPTER, SHOOT ENEMIES IN THE AIR AND GROUND, COLLECT POWER-UPS, AND DEFEAT BOSSES TO ADVANCE LEVELS.

THE GAME DIFFERS FROM MOST OTHERS IN THE GENRE IN THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE AIRCRAFT YOU USE AT THE START OF EACH LEVEL. THE JET FIGHTER ALWAYS SHOOTS STRAIGHT FORWARD; POWER-UPS INCREASE THE WIDTH AND STRENGTH OF ITS SHOTS. THE HELICOPTER FIRES THINNER AND WEAKER SHOTS, BUT TURNS IN THE DIRECTION IT MOVES (SIMILAR TO THE LATER ZERO GUNNER), GIVING IT GREAT RANGE; POWERUPS INCREASE THE STRENGTH OF SHOTS, AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF BULLETS PER SHOT (ADDING A SMALL "SPREAD" EFFECT TO THE SHOT WHILE MOVING AROUND).
BOTH THE FIGHTER AND THE HELICOPTER ALSO START WITH THREE BOMBS WHICH WIPE OUT EVERYTHING IN THEIR PATH, INCLUDING ENEMY SHOTS. THESE BOMBS ARE ALSO UNIQUE COMPARED TO SIMILAR GAMES, IN THAT THEY PRODUCE A LINE OF SMALL HORIZONTAL BLASTS THAT CAN BE "DIRECTED" AT THE LINE TRAVELS ACROSS THE GROUND, BY PRESSING LEFT AND RIGHT (SIMILAR TO THE HELICOPTER'S SHOTS). ADDITIONAL BOMBS CAN BE PICKED UP DURING THE COURSE OF THE GAME.

LOSING A LIFE RESETS YOUR POWER AND BOMB COUNT TO THE AMOUNT YOU START WITH. "AIR DUEL" IS A CHALLENGING GAME, AND LATER LEVELS CAN BECOME NEARLY UNPLAYABLE IF A SINGLE LIFE IS LOST.</desc>

HE WILL NOW HAVE TO HIT EACH OF THE FORTY THIEVES AS THEY ENTER THE ROOM - BUT IF ONE OF THEM SHOULD MAKE IT TO THE ROOM AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN HE WILL PICK UP ONE OF THE SEVEN BAGS OF MONEY THEN TRY TO TAKE IT BACK UP TO THE ROOM AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. IF THE THIEVES TAKE ALL SEVEN OF THE MONEY BAGS UP TO THE TOP OF THE SCREEN, IT WILL COST ALI BABA A LIFE; BUT, IF HE "HITS" ALL FORTY THIEVES WITHOUT THIS HAPPENING (EXCEPT THE LARGE AND INVULNERABLE RED ONE), HE WILL PROCEED TO THE NEXT LEVEL.</desc>

		<name>Alien Arena</name>
		<desc>PLAYER 1 (THOR) AND PLAYER 2 (ZESPAR) ARE BATTLING IT OUT IN THE ALIEN ARENA. THE GAME IS TIMED, WITH 2 MINUTES FOR EVERY 25 CENTS INSERTED, REGARDLESS OF YOUR CHOICE OF 1-PLAYER OR 2-PLAYER. MORE TIME CAN BE PURCHASED AT ANY TIME BEFORE THE TIMER READS ':00'.

IN A 1-PLAYER GAME YOU ARE THOR, WITH CONTROLS ON THE RIGHT, AND THE COMPUTER PLAYS ZESPAR, ON THE LEFT. IN A 2-PLAYER GAME EACH OF YOU CHOOSES A SET OF CONTROLS. WHEN TIME RUNS OUT IN EITHER GAME, IT REVERTS TO A "PLAY AS LONG AS YOU CAN KEEP ALIVE AND POSSIBLY WINNING EXTRA LIVES" 1-PLAYER GAME. IF IT STARTED AS A 2-PLAYER GAME, WHOEVER IS WINNING WHEN TIME RUNS OUT IS THE ONE WHO GETS TO BATTLE THE COMPUTER.

THE BASIC THEME OF THE GAME IS "CAPTURE THE FLAG (WHILE PROTECTING YOUR OWN)". YOU CAN ASSEMBLE OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE AIDS BY PICKING UP 'PIECES' STREWN ABOUT YOUR HALF OF THE PLAYFIELD. THE PIECES ARE COLOR-CODED, RANDOMLY CREATED AND DISTRIBUTED, AND DIFFERENT OBJECTS REQUIRE DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF PIECES TO ASSEMBLE. ONCE YOU START ASSEMBLING AN OBJECT, YOU MUST FINISH ASSEMBLING IT (PICK UP ENOUGH PIECES FOR IT) AND PLACE IT... OR 'FLUSH' THE PIECES YOU'VE PICKED UP SO FAR. FLUSH IS MOSTLY USED FOR WHEN YOU ACCIDENTALLY PICKED UP THE WRONG COLOR PIECE... OR WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE REQUIRED PIECES TO ASSEMBLE THE REST OF THE OBJECT. A STATUS BAR SHOWS WHAT OBJECT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION, AND HOW MANY MORE PIECES ARE NEEDED. ONLY ONE OBJECT CAN BE ASSEMBLED AT A TIME. ONCE IT IS ASSEMBLED, YOU MUST CARRY IT TO WHERE YOU WANT TO PLACE OR LAUNCH IT AND PRESS THE 'PLACE' BUTTON.

THERE IS A DELAY AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH ROUND BEFORE THE FLAGS APPEAR, AND THEN A FURTHER DELAY BEFORE THE MIDFIELD BARRIER COMES DOWN. USE THIS TIME TO START ASSEMBLING AN OFFENSE OR DEFENSE OR BOTH (THIS KEEPS THE OPPONENT FROM JUST STARTING EACH ROUND BY MAKING A SUICIDE DASH FOR YOUR FLAG). WHEN THE FLAGS DO APPEAR, THEIR PLACEMENT IS RANDOM, BUT WITHIN A SMALL DISTANCE FROM THE BACK WALL OF YOUR HALF OF THE ARENA.

A ROUND ENDS WHEN AN OPPOSING FLAG IS CAPTURED BY A PLAYER, OR WHEN A PLAYER IS DESTROYED BY ONE OF HIS OPPONENT'S OFFENSIVE OR DEFENSIVE OBJECTS. THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF NUANCES TO HOW THE OBJECTS BEHAVE, HOW THEY SCORE, ETC.</desc>

		<desc>ALIENS IS A SCROLLING RUN 'N' GUN GAME FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS BASED ON THE CLASSIC 1986 SCIENCE-FICTION MOVIE OF THE SAME NAME. PLAYERS TAKE ON THE ROLE OF EITHER ELLEN RIPLEY (IN THE SINGLE-PLAYER GAME) OR CORPORAL HICKS (IN THE TWO-PLAYER GAME) AND MUST SHOOT THEIR WAY THROUGH THE ALIEN-INFESTED LEVELS OF THE LV426 BASE TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE TOGETHER WITH 'NEWT', THE LITTLE GIRL WHO SURVIVED THE ALIEN INVASION OF HER SETTLEMENT.

PLAYERS BEGIN THE GAME ARMED ONLY WITH A PULSE RIFLE BUT WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO UPGRADE TO OTHER WEAPONS, INCLUDING FLAMETHROWERS AND GRENADE LAUNCHERS. BOMBS CAN ALSO BE FOUND THAT CAUSE GREATER DAMAGE TO THE ENEMIES. EACH PLAYER LIFE STARTS WITH EIGHT HEALTH POINTS WHICH DEPLETE UPON CONTACT WITH EITHER AN ALIEN OR AN ENEMY PROJECTILE AND ONCE ALL HEALTH POINTS ARE LOST, THE PLAYER LOSES A LIFE. EACH STAGE ENDS WITH A BOSS ENCOUNTER, WITH THE GAME'S FINAL BOSS BEING THE ALIEN QUEEN HERSELF. 

AS WELL AS THE STANDARD SIDE-SCROLLING STAGES, INTERMITTENT INTO-THE-SCREEN STAGES ALSO FEATURE THAT HAVE THE PLAYERS RIDING ATOP THE MARINES' APC VEHICLE, SHOOTING THE HORDES OF ALIENS THAT SWARM TOWARDS IT.

AS WELL AS THE STANDARD ALIENS AND FACE-HUGGERS FROM THE ORIGINAL FILM (THAT NOW COME IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT COLOURS), THERE ARE MANY ENEMIES THAT WERE CREATED ONLY FOR THE ARCADE GAME AND HAVE NEVER APPEARED ELSEWHERE IN THE ALIEN FRANCHISE. THESE INCLUDE FLYING ALIENS AND MUTATED HUMANS, AS WELL AS ALL END-OF-STAGE BOSSES PRIOR TO THE ALIEN QUEEN.</desc>

EACH LEVEL HAS A NUMBER OF PATROLLING ENEMIES CALLED 'AMIDARS' THAT MUST BE AVOIDED BUT PLAYERS ARE AIDED IN THEIR TASK WITH THE INCLUSION OF A JUMP BUTTON WHICH, WHEN USED, CAUSES ALL THE ON-SCREEN ENEMIES TO JUMP, GIVING THE PLAYER TIME TO ESCAPE. THERE ARE ONLY THREE 'JUMPS' GIVEN PER LEVEL, HOWEVER.

ON ODD-NUMBERED LEVELS, THE PLAYER'S CHARACTER IS A GORILLA WHO EATS COCONUTS; ON EVEN-NUMBERED LEVELS, IT'S A PAINT ROLLER. THE GAME'S ENEMY AMIDARS ARE SAVAGES AND PIGS RESPECTIVELY. WHENEVER A RECTANGULAR PORTION OF THE BOARD IS CLEARED (EITHER BY COLLECTING ALL SURROUNDING COCONUTS, OR PAINTING ALL SURROUNDING EDGES), THE RECTANGLE IS COLOURED IN AND ON THE EVEN LEVELS, BONUS POINTS ARE AWARDED, WHILE ON THE ODD-NUMBERED LEVELS, POINTS ARE AWARDED FOR EACH COCONUT EATEN. 

IF PLAYERS MANAGE TO FILL IN ALL FOUR CORNER RECTANGLES OF A BOARD, THEY ARE BRIEFLY ABLE TO KILL THE ENEMIES BY TOUCHING THEM (SIMILAR TO THE 'POWER-PILL' FROM NAMCO'S PAC-MAN SERIES). ENEMIES KILLED IN THIS WAY FALL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND RECOVER AFTER A FEW SECONDS.

ON THE EVEN-NUMBERED PAINT ROLLER LEVELS, THE ROLLER CANNOT MOVE TOO FAR FROM GRID RECTANGLES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN FILLED WITHOUT RUNNING OUT OF PAINT AND HAVING TO RETURN TO COMPLETED PARTS OF THE MAP TO REFRESH ITS SUPPLY. WHEN THIS HAPPENS, ANY PAINTED LINES THAT ARE NOT PART OF A FILLED RECTANGLE WILL VANISH AND MUST BE PAINTED AGAIN. THIS MEANS THAT THE PLAYER MUST BUILD THEIR COMPLETED SQUARES AROUND THE STARTING POINT OF THE LEVEL AND SPREAD OUTWARDS, RATHER THAN COMPLETING SQUARES ON ANY PART OF THE BOARD AS THEY CAN ON THE ODD-NUMBERED GORILLA LEVELS. THIS MAKES FILLING IN THE CORNER RECTANGLES TO BECOME INVINCIBLE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

IN BETWEEN LEVELS PLAYERS ARE GIVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF EARNING 5,000 BONUS POINTS. HERE, AN AMIDAR MOVES ACROSS THE TOP OF THE SCREEN, BY PUSHING THE JUMP BUTTON THE AMIDAR TRACES A RANDOM PATH DOWN TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. IF THE AMIDAR REACHES A BUNCH OF BANANAS, A BONUS IS AWARDED.</desc>

WORMS CAN BE SAFELY EATEN FROM BEHIND. 

LARGE QUEEN ANTS ARE SITUATED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE NEST AND EATING THESE WILL TEMPORARILY CLEAR ALL INSECTS FROM THE SCREEN.  

ANTEATER HAS A SHORT DAY-NIGHT CYCLE REPRESENTED BY A MOVING SUN AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. ONCE THE SUN HAS TRAVELED ACROSS THE SCREEN AND NIGHT FALLS, A SPIDER WILL APPEAR. THE SPIDER CLIMBS DOWN THE ANTEATER'S TONGUE, TAKING A LIFE IF IT REACHES THE TONGUE'S TIP. THE SPIDER CAN ONLY BE KILLED BY EATING A QUEEN ANT.</desc>

A LONG TIME AGO, AN EVIL WIZARD HAS TAKEN OVER THE PEACEFUL KINGDOM OF SHAHARIYARD AND USED SORCERY TO TRANSFORM ITS KING INTO A MONKEY. THE PLAYER MUST DEFEAT EACH OF THE GAME'S SEVEN GUARDIANS TO RECLAIM THE 'JEWEL OF SEVEN COLOURS' AND RELEASE THE KING FROM THE EVIL HEX. 

EACH PLAYER CAN SELECT FROM FOUR DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERS: PRINCE LASSID, PRINCESS LISA, SINBAD OR AFSHAEL. EACH CHARACTER CARRIES A PRIMARY WEAPON - PRINCE LASSID AND SINBAD CARRY SWORDS, PRINCESS LISA A MAGICAL VEIL AND AFSHAEL A MACE. IN ADDITION TO THE WEAPONS, PLAYERS CAN ALSO SUMMON A MAGICAL ATTACK IN THE FORM OF A HUGE GENIE. THE GENIE WILL ONLY APPEAR FOR A FEW SECONDS BUT DURING THAT TIME, PLAYERS HAVE CONTROL OVER THE GENIE AND CAN STEER HIM TOWARDS ENEMIES. 

ARABIAN MAGIC HAS SEVEN DIFFERENT STAGES WITH ONE OF THE POWERFUL GUARDIANS AWAITING THE PLAYER AT THE END OF EACH LEVEL. EACH GUARDIAN, ONCE DEFEATED, WILL DROP A JEWEL WHICH FORMS A PART OF THE JEWEL OF SEVEN COLOURS. GUARDIANS, ONCE DEFEATED, WILL JOIN THE PLAYER AND BECOME A GENIE. EACH LEVEL IS LITTERED WITH VASES AND WOODEN CHESTS WHICH, WHEN BROKEN, REVEAL TREASURE ITEMS AND POWER-UPS. 

THE GAME ENDS WHEN THE PLAYER HAS RECOVERED THE JEWEL OF SEVEN COLOURS, SAVED THE KING (MAKING HIM HUMAN IN THE PROCESS) AND RESTORED PEACE TO SHAHARIYARD.</desc>

THE GAME ALSO FEATURES TWO NEW FEATURES FOR BRICKS. NOTCHED SILVER BRICKS, LIKE NORMAL SILVER BRICKS, TAKE SEVERAL HITS TO DESTROY. HOWEVER, AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AFTER DESTRUCTION, THEY REGENERATE AT FULL STRENGTH. FORTUNATELY, CLEARING A LEVEL DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT ANY NOTCHED BRICKS TO BE DESTROYED. ALSO, SOME BRICKS MOVE FROM SIDE TO SIDE AS LONG AS THEIR LEFT AND/OR RIGHT SIDES ARE NOT OBSTRUCTED BY OTHER BRICKS.

THE GAME FEATURES A MINI-BOSS IN THE FORM OF A GIANT BRAIN, WHICH WILL HELP YOU PRACTICE FOR DOH. YOU MUST AIM FOR THE BRAIN'S MOUTH TO DEFEAT IT.</desc>

THE 3RD CHAPTER IN TAITO'S LEGENDARY 1 OR 2-PLAYER BAT AND BALL GAME, IN WHICH PLAYERS ONCE AGAIN CONTROL A PADDLE AND MUST TRY TO REBOUND A BALL INTO PATTERNS OF BRICKS TO REMOVE THEM FROM THE PLAY AREA.

EACH LEVEL IS PATROLLED BY ENEMIES AND CERTAIN BRICKS, WHEN HIT, RELEASE POWER-UPS WHICH THEN ROLL DOWN THE SCREEN AND CAN BE COLLECTED BY THE PLAYER.

WHILE THE 3RD CHAPTER CONTAINS 50 BRAND NEW LEVELS FOR PLAYERS TO FIGHT THROUGH, THE ACTUAL GAMEPLAY ITSELF REMAINS UNALTERED FROM THE FIRST 2 GAMES. THE ONLY REAL DIFFERENCES ARE A REVAMP OF BOTH THE GRAPHICS AND SOUND, AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF MINOR ENHANCEMENTS TO THE IN-GAME POWER-UPS.</desc>

		<desc>AFTER A SUDDEN ALIEN ASSAULT, THE ARKANOID SPACESHIP HAS BEEN DESTROYED AND THE ONLY SURVIVOR, THE SMALL 'VAUS' SPACE VESSEL, HAS BEEN MYSTERIOUSLY TRAPPED IN ANOTHER DIMENSION BY AN UNKNOWN ENEMY. THE PLAYER IS CHARGED WITH HELPING THE 'VAUS' OVERCOME THE SECURITY SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS THE MANY ENEMIES THAT GUARD THEM, BEFORE FINALLY FINDING AND DESTROYING 'DOH', THE ALIEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK.

ARKANOID IS AN UPDATE OF THE EARLY BALL AND PADDLE VIDEO GAMES - AND SPECIFICALLY OF ATARI'S 1978 CLASSIC, "SUPER BREAKOUT" - IN WHICH THE PLAYER TAKES CONTROL OF A PADDLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND MUST USE IT TO DEFLECT A BALL INTO ROWS OF BRICKS AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN, THUS DESTROYING THEM AND, EVENTUALLY, CLEARING THE SCREEN TO PROGRESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL. 

AS WELL AS IMPRESSIVE AND COLOURFUL GRAPHICS, ARKANOID INTRODUCED A NUMBER OF NEW ELEMENTS TO THE CLASSIC BAT 'N' BALL GAMEPLAY. CERTAIN BRICKS, WHEN DESTROYED, WOULD RELEASE A POWER-UP - IN THE FORM OF A FALLING CAPSULE. THE PLAYER HAD TO CATCH THE CAPSULE TO RETRIEVE THE POWER-UP. AMONG THE MANY ENHANCEMENTS THE POWER-UPS PROVIDED WERE AN INCREASED 'BAT' SIZE, MULTIPLE BALLS, 'STICKY' BALL (WHICH WOULD STICK TO THE BAT AND COULD BE RELEASED WHEN THE PLAYER CHOSE) AND EVEN A LASER, WHICH ALLOWED THE PLAYER TO SHOOT THE BRICKS.</desc>

		<desc>YOUR MISSION IS TO RECLAIM YOUR HOMELAND BY DESTROYING THE ENEMY FORCES THAT HAVE TAKEN OVER. YOU HAVE AN ASSAULT TANK, THE SUPREME MOBILE WEAPON. YOUR TANK HAS ARTILLERY GUNS AND GRENADES, CAN PERFORM RAPID ROLLS TO DODGE ENEMY SHOTS, AND USES POWER WHEELIES TO LAUNCH GRENADES.

YOUR CONTROLS ARE TWO 4-POSITION JOYSTICKS WITH TRIGGERS. THESE CONTROLS MAKE ASSAULT LIKE NO OTHER TANK GAME. YOU HAVE A QUICK, HIGHLY RESPONSIVE VEHICLE WITH FAST MOVEMENT IN ALL DIRECTIONS. TO AVOID ENEMY SHOTS, RAPID ROLL YOUR TANK LEFT OR RIGHT BY MOVING BOTH JOYSTICKS TO THE SAME SIDE. TO LAUNCH GRENADES, PUT THE TANK IN THE POWER WHEELIE POSITION BY MOVING BOTH JOYSTICKS TO THE OUTSIDE, THEN PRESSING EITHER TRIGGER. YOUR GRENADES ARE TRIPLE THE FIRE POWER OF YOUR TANK'S STANDARD SHOTS.

YOUR TANK IS ALWAYS IN THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN NO MATTER WHAT DIRECTION YOU ARE GOING. WITH ASSAULT'S 360-DEGREE SCROLLING PLAYFIELD, THE WORLD ROTATES AROUND YOU AS YOU MOVE. AN ARROW ALWAYS POINTS YOU TOWARDS THE EXIT TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

THE LIFT ZONE GIVES YOU AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE INVADERS AND A SPECTACULAR VIEW OF THE PLAYFIELD. EACH LIFT ZONE IS A FIVE-SIDED PLATFORM ON THE PLAYFIELD THAT FLASHES RED WHEN YOU CAN USE IT. WHEN YOU DRIVE ONTO THE LIFT ZONE, YOUR TANK JETS STRAIGHT UP TO GET A BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING TERRAIN AND ENEMY LINES. FROM THIS OVERHEAD POSITION, YOU CAN RECONNOITER ENEMY FORCES AND BOMB ENEMY OUTPOSTS.

FIGHT YOUR WAY THROUGH 11 DIFFERENT LEVELS TO SEEK OUT AND DESTROY THE INVADERÂS HEADQUARTERS. TO SUCCEED, YOU MUST:
DODGE ENEMY GUNFIRE WITH THE RAPID ROLL MANEUVER.
ASSAULT ENEMY LINES WITH LONG-RANGE POWERFUL GRENADES LAUNCHED FROM POWER WHEELIES.
DESTROY ALL ENEMY TANKS YOU ENCOUNTER TO PREVENT REAR ATTACKS.
BOMB ENEMY OUTPOSTS AND RECONNOITER ENEMY EMPLACEMENTS USING THE LIFT ZONES.
PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST ENEMY ARTILLERY USING BUILDINGS AND TREES.
BLOW UP THE LARGE CANNONS ON EACH LEVEL WHILE YOU AVOID ENEMY ATTACKS.
FOLLOW THE ARROW TO FIND THE EXIT TO THE NEXT LEVEL. BEFORE YOU CAN EXIT, YOU MUST DESTROY THE LARGE CANNONS DEFENDING THE ENEMY STRONGHOLDS.</desc>

		<desc>ASTERIX IS A HORIZONTALLY-SCROLLING BEAT-EM-UP FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS AND IS BASED ON THE FRENCH COMIC-BOOK SERIES, 'ASTERIX &amp; OBELIX'. PLAYERS FIGHT AS EITHER ASTERIX THE GAUL OR HIS BEST FRIEND, OBELIX, AS THEY TAKE ON THE MIGHT OF THE OPPRESSIVE ROMAN EMPIRE. 

ASTERIX AND OBELIX EACH HAVE STANDARD JUMP/ATTACK CONTROLS, AS WELL AS A DASH ATTACK ACTIVATED BY TAPPING THE JOYSTICK FORWARD TWICE THEN PRESSING THE ATTACK BUTTON. EACH CHARACTER ALSO POSESSES A POWERFUL SPINNING ARM ATTACK, THIS IS ACTIVATED BY HOLDING THE ATTACK BUTTON FOR A SHORT WHILE UNTIL THE CHARACTER'S FACE TURNS RED, AFTER WHICH PLAYERS MUST RELEASE THE BUTTON. IF THE BUTTON IS HELD DOWN FOR TOO LONG, THE CHARACTER GETS OUT OF BREATH AND TAKES A FEW SECONDS TO RECOVER.

THE HEROES' MAIN FOES ARE ROMAN LEGIONARIES AND FAT - OCASSIONALLY HORSEBACK RIDING - CENTURIONS. AFTER AN ENEMY HAS BEEN BEATEN ENOUGH TO FALL TO THE GROUND, HE CAN BE PICKED UP AND ATTACKED AGAIN, THE NATURE OF THE ATTACK IS DEPENDANT ON WHICH CHARACTER PICKS THEM UP; ASTERIX WILL SPIN THE STUNNED ENEMY ABOVE HIS HEAD, WHEREAS OBELIX SMASHES HIM REPEATEDLY INTO THE GROUND. THESE STUNNED ENEMIES ALSO ACT AS TEMPOARARY WEAPONS, AS THEY WILL CAUSE DAMAGE TO ANY OTHER ENEMIES THEY COME INTO CONTACT WITH.</desc>

		<desc>ASTEROIDS DELUXE IS A 1 OR 2-PLAYER GAME WITH AN X-Y OR VECTOR-GENERATOR MONITOR. THE GAME DEPICTS A THIRD-PERSON VIEW OF A PLAYER'S SPACESHIP BATTLING TO DESTROY ASTEROIDS, FLYING SAUCERS AND ENEMY SHIPS OR 'DEATH STARS' (SHAPED LIKE CLUSTERS OF TRIANGLES). WHEN HIT, THE ASTEROIDS AND DEATH STARS WILL BREAK INTO PROGRESSIVELY SMALLER PIECES. 

PLAYERS CAN PUT UP AN OCTAGON-SHAPED 'SHIELD' TO TEMPORARILY PROTECT THEIR SPACESHIP. HOWEVER, THIS SHIELD WEARS OUT WITH USE. 

LARGE ASTEROIDS APPEAR AND DRIFT IN FROM THE OUTER EDGES OF THE DISPLAY. BY PRESSING THE ROTATE LEFT AND ROTATE RIGHT PUSHBUTTONS ON THE CONTROL PANEL, THE PLAYER MAY AIM A SPACESHIP TOWARD ANY OF THE ASTEROIDS. THE PLAYER USES THE FIRE PUSHBUTTON TO SHOOT AT THE ASTEROIDS AND OTHER OBJECTS. 

WHEN SHOT, EACH LARGE ASTEROID DIVIDES INTO TWO MEDIUM-SIZED ASTEROIDS, AND THE GAME ADDS 20 POINTS TO THE PLAYER'S SCORE. MEDIUM-SIZED ASTEROIDS, WHEN SHOT, DIVIDE INTO TWO SMALL-SIZED ASTEROIDS, AND THE GAME AWARDS 50 POINTS TO THE PLAYER. WHEN SHOT THE SMALLEST ASTEROID DISAPPEARS AND THE GAME ADDS 100 POINTS TO THE PLAYER'S SCORE. 

IN ADDITION TO ASTEROIDS, THE PLAYERS CAN SCORE POINTS FOR SHOOTING THE VARIOUS ENEMY SHIPS. WHEN HIT, THE LARGE SHIPS ('DEATH STARS' SHAPED LIKE HEXAGONS) SCORE 50 POINTS AND BREAK INTO THREE DIAMOND SHAPES. THE MEDIUM-SIZED ENEMY OR DIAMOND, WHEN HIT, GRANTS THE PLAYER 100 POINTS AND BREAKS INTO TWO SMALL TRIANGULAR PIECES. THESE SMALL PIECES DISAPPEAR WHEN THE PLAYER HITS THEM, AND THE SCORE INCREASES BY 200 POINTS. 

AT ANY TIME DURING GAME PLAY, A FLYING SAUCER MAY APPEAR FROM EITHER SIDE OF THE DISPLAY. THE GAME AWARDS PLAYERS 200 POINTS FOR SHOOTING A LARGE SAUCER AND 1,000 POINTS FOR A SMALL SAUCER (THE LATTER IS A SMALLER TARGET FOR PLAYERS, THOUGH NOT ANY FASTER MOVING THAN THE LARGE ONE. IT ALSO SHOOTS MORE ACCURATELY). 

THE PLAYER'S OBJECTIVE IN THE GAME IS TO SHOOT AND DESTROY AS MANY ASTEROIDS, SAUCERS, AND ENEMY SHIPS AS POSSIBLE BEFORE ALL HIS OR HER SPACESHIPS ARE DESTROYED. A SHIP IS DESTROYED IF AN ASTEROID, SAUCER OR ENEMY SHIP SMASHES INTO IT, OR IF A FLYING SAUCER SHOOTS IT. TO PREVENT LOSING A SHIP, THE PLAYER MAY PRESS THE THRUST PUSHBUTTON TO MOVE OUT OF THE PATH OF AN ONCOMING OBJECT. 

AS AN EMERGENCY MANEUVER, A PLAYER CAN PRESS THE SHIELDS BUTTON. AN OCTAGON WILL THEN APPEAR AROUND THE PLAYER'S SHIP AS PROTECTION FROM ALL ENEMIES. FOR CHALLENGE THE SHIELD POWER LASTS ONLY ABOUT 10 SECONDS, BUT THE POWER IS RENEWED WITH EACH SHIP. THE AMOUNT OF SHIELDING POWER AVAILABLE IS SHOWN BY THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE OCTAGON (DIM MEANS ALMOST EXHAUSTED POWER).</desc>

		<desc>ASTEROIDS © 1979 ATARI, INCORPORATED.

ASTEROIDS IS A LEGENDARY, GENRE DEFINING GAME - IN AN ERA REPLETE WITH GENRE-DEFINING CLASSICS - IN WHICH A SINGLE PLAYER TAKES CONTROL OF A SPACESHIP TRAPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ASTEROID BELT. A NUMBER OF LARGE, SLOW-MOVING ASTEROIDS DRIFT RANDOMLY AROUND THE PLAY AREA AND MUST BE SHOT BY THE PLAYER. WHEN SHOT, THE ASTEROIDS WILL BREAK INTO A NUMBER OF SMALLER PIECES WHICH MUST ALSO BE SHOT UNTIL EVENTUALLY, ALL OF THE ASTEROIDS AND FRAGMENTS WILL BE DESTROYED AND THE NEXT WAVE BEGINS. 

ASTEROIDS INTRODUCED REAL-WORLD PHYSICS TO VIDEO GAMES FOR THE FIRST TIME, WITH SPEED AND INERTIA ALL ADDING TO THE PLAYER'S PROBLEMS. AS WELL AS THE INERTIA OF THE PLAYER'S SHIP - FORCING THE PLAYER TO ALLOW FOR THE SHIP SLOWING DOWN AND SPEEDING UP WHENEVER THE THRUST BUTTON WAS UTILIZED - SHOT ASTEROIDS WOULD OFTEN SEND FRAGMENTS FLYING IN SEEMINGLY RANDOM DIRECTIONS, AND AT VARYING AND UNPREDICTABLE SPEEDS. 

AS WELL AS THE EVER-PRESENT ASTEROIDS, FLYING SAUCERS ALSO MAKE A REGULAR APPEARANCE. THESE MOVE HORIZONTALLY AND DIAGONALLY AROUND THE SCREEN, FIRING AT THE PLAYER'S SHIP, AND MUST BE QUICKLY DESTROYED. THEY ARE DESTROYED WHEN HIT BY THE PLAYER'S SHOT, WHEN HIT BY A SAUCER'S SHOT OR WHEN THEY COLLIDE WITH AN ASTEROID. 

CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

SPACESHIP - THIS IS YOU, THE PLAYER. YOU CAN ROTATE 360 DEGREES, FIRE BULLETS, THRUST FORWARD IN ANY DIRECTION, AND HYPERSPACE TO SAFETY IF YOU FEEL YOU ARE IN DANGER. 

LARGE ASTEROID - THESE ARE THE LARGE ROCKS THAT FILL THE SCREEN AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH STAGE. HITTING ONE WITH A BULLET WILL BREAK IT APART INTO TWO MEDIUM ASTEROIDS. 

MEDIUM ASTEROID - SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN LARGE ASTEROIDS, BUT FASTER MOVING. SHOOTING ONE OF THESE WILL RESULT IN TWO SMALL ASTEROIDS. 

SMALL ASTEROID - THESE ARE THE SMALLEST AND FASTEST ROCKS ON THE SCREEN. IF A BULLET HITS ONE OF THESE, IT WILL VAPORIZE. 

LARGE SAUCER - LARGE FLYING SAUCERS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN FROM TIME TO TIME, RANDOMLY FIRING SHOTS AROUND THE SCREEN. THEY POSE A MINOR THREAT. 

SMALL SAUCER - THE SMALLER FLYING SAUCERS ARE DEADLIER THAN THE LARGE VARIETY. THEY ARE MUCH MORE PRECISE WITH THEIR SHOTS, AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO KILL YOU. ELIMINATE THEM QUICKLY OR GET OUT OF THEIR RANGE.</desc>

		<desc>THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO FILL THE 7X7 TILED BOARD WITH YOUR COLORED GLOBS. THIS IS DONE BY MOVING YOUR GLOB ADJACENT TO YOUR OPPONENT'S GLOB AND TURNING IT TO YOUR COLOR. 2 TYPES OF MOVES CAN BE MADE DURING THE GAME: FIRST, PLACING A GLOB ADJACENT TO ONE OF YOUR OWN DUPLICATES IT; OR SECOND, A GLOB MAY JUMP TWO SPACES, BUT IT WILL NOT BE DUPLICATED. THE NUMBER AND ARRANGEMENT OF OBSTACLES IN THE PLAYFIELD CHANGES BETWEEN EACH ROUND, SO STRATEGIES MUST BE CHANGED IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THESE BARRIERS.

EVENTUALLY, ALL THE EMPTY SPACES ON THE BOARD ARE FILLED, AND THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST COLORED GLOBS WINS. IN SINGLE-PLAYER MODE IF THE HUMAN PLAYER WINS, THEY MUST FACE A MORE DIFFICULT COMPUTER OPPONENT IN THE NEXT ROUND. THE GAME IS OVER WHEN TIME RUNS OUT, REGARDLESS IF YOU'RE WINNING OR NOT. YOU CAN 'BUY-IN' AT ANY TIME.</desc>

YOU START OUT WITH NOTHING MORE THAN YOUR FEET TO FIGHT WITH AND NO MORE PROTECTION THAN ATHENA'S UNDERWEAR (SHE ACTUALLY LOSES HER DRESS IN THE INTRO TO THE FIRST WORLD) BUT CAN COLLECT A HUGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WEAPONS AND ARMOUR, AS WELL AS A GREAT NUMBER OF POWER-UPS RANGING FROM THE USUAL MORE-POWER-FOR WEAPON OR ARMOUR, THROUGH BOOTS THAT ALLOW HER TO JUMP HIGHER AND WINGS FOR FLYING, TO ONE WHERE ATHENA BECOMES A SEMI-GOD AND ACTUALLY GROWTHS TO TWICE HER USUAL SIZE AND GETS A HUGE BURNING SWORD AND FULL ARMOUR.

THE WORLDS ARE FILLED WITH STONE BLOCKS THAT CAN BE SMASHED WHEN SEARCHING FOR SECRETS AND ITEMS, AS WELL AS SEVERAL LEVELS CONNECTED BY LADDERS OR OTHER MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION.

ATHENA IS A GREAT GAME, AND WILL GIVE EVEN THE MOST HARDENED PLATFORM-PLAYER A REAL CHALLENGE, FOR IT IS NOT AN EASY GAME, EVEN WITH THE DIP SWITCHES IN 'EASY' MODE.</desc>

IF A YELLOW PACCET IS ACCIDENTALLY SHOT OR KILLED BY AN ENEMY, HE WILL EXPLODE AND SEND HIS EYEBALL FLYING - AND IF THE PLAYER CATCHES THE EYEBALL HE WILL RECEIVE A SINGLE POINT. SEVERAL NEW ENEMIES HAVE ALSO BEEN INTRODUCED (ONE OF WHICH, THE "BLOCK BRAIN", FIRST APPEARED IN BERABOH MAN, AND ANOTHER, THE "BLACK PACCET", IS AN EVIL VERSION OF THE PACCETS); THE BOSS FOR THE THIRTIETH STAGE, "DARK PACCET", IS ALSO AN ENORMOUS EVIL VERSION OF THE PACCETS. IF THE PLAYER DEFEATS DARK PACCET ON HIS FIRST TRY, THE GAME SHALL NOT END - INSTEAD, SIX MORE STAGES WILL HAVE TO BE PLAYED, AND IF A PLAYER WINS THE GAME (REGARDLESS OF IF IT ENDS ON STAGE 30 OR 36), HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ENTER HIS NAME ON ITS HIGH SCORE TABLE. THERE ARE NOW FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF CAPSULES; AS A GENERAL RULE, THE YELLOW ONES CONTAIN PACCETS, WHILE THE RED ONES CONTAIN BAGANNS (THE PAC-MAN-LIKE ALIENS FROM THE ORIGINAL TITLE), THE BLUE ONES CONTAIN SHOT POWERUPS, AND THE GREEN ONES CONTAIN SPEED POWERUPS. IT IS ALSO NOW IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE BACKWARDS (LIKE IN SUPER MARIO BROS.) - BUT IF THE PLAYER DIES, HE WILL BE SENT BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE STAGE (UNLIKE IN THE ORIGINAL, WHERE HE WOULD RESTART IN THE PLACE WHERE HE DIED) AND BE REPRIMANDED BY THE "PACCET OJISAN", WHO ALSO APPEARS FOR THE START OF SOME STAGES TO GIVE HIM ADVICE.</desc>

		<desc>THIS IS AN "ARKANOID"-TYPE GAME WITH A FEW TWISTS. INSTEAD OF CONTROLLING A PADDLE, YOU CONTROL THE BALL ITSELF BY ALTERING ITS MOMENTUM USING THE JOYSTICK. VARIOUS BLOCKS (SQUARES, TRIANGLES, AND SPECIAL BLOCKS CONTAINING POWERUPS) ADVANCE DOWN FROM THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. THE PLAYER DIES WHEN THE BALL GOES DOWN THROUGH A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, OR IF THE BLOCKS REACH THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. WHEN YOU DIE, YOU START OVER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LEVEL. ALTHOUGH THE GAME HAS A BALL AND PADDLE LOOK AND FEEL, PUZZLE ELEMENTS COME INTO PLAY LATER IN THE GAME.</desc>

		<desc>A VERTICALLY SCROLLING SHOOT'EM UP GAME. AS IS THE STANDARD WITH MOST ARCADE SHOOTERS, THE PLAYER CONTROLS THEIR SHIP WITH A JOYSTICK AND TWO BUTTONS. ONE BUTTON (FIRE) SHOOTS THE MAIN GUNS, AND THE OTHER BUTTON (BOMB) RELEASES A SMART BOMB THAT SPREADS HUGE ENERGY BALLS ALL AROUND THE PLAYER'S SHIP.

AS ENEMIES ARE DESTROYED, THE PLAYER GAINS EXPERIENCE POINTS THAT ARE SEPARATE FROM THE SCORE. FOR EVERY 288 EXPERIENCE POINTS GAINED, THE MAIN GUN WILL 'LEVEL UP', BECOMING MUCH STRONGER. THIS IS ANALOGOUS TO EXPERIENCE POINTS AND LEVELING UP IN ROLE PLAYING GAMES. THE WEAPON CAN ONLY LEVEL UP TWICE, SO AFTER IT HAS ACHIEVED ITS MAXIMUM LEVEL, 288 EXPERIENCE POINTS WILL GRANT THE PLAYER AN EXTRA BOMB.

THE PLAYER CAN ALSO GRAB P ICONS TO INCREASE THE POWER OF THE CURRENT LEVEL GUN. A MAXIMUM OF FIVE "P"S CAN BE COLLECTED PER EXPERIENCE LEVEL; GETTING MORE AFTER THIS GIVES EXTRA POINTS INSTEAD.

COLLECTING B ICONS INCREASES THE NUMBER OF BOMBS, TO A MAXIMUM OF 7.

APART FROM DESTROYING ENEMIES, POINTS CAN BE GAINED FROM COLLECTING GOLDEN V-SHAPED MEDALS. AFTER THE LEVEL IS FINISHED, 3000 POINTS ARE AWARDED FOR EVERY SMALL ONE, AND 5000 POINTS FOR EVERY LARGE ONE. IF THE PLAYER'S SHIP IS DESTROYED DURING A LEVEL, ALL MEDALS COLLECTED ARE LOST.</desc>

		<desc>BATTLETOADS IS A (MOSTLY) HORIZONTALLY-SCROLLING BEAT-EM-UP IN WHICH UP TO THREE PLAYERS TAKE ON THE ROLES OF RASH, PIMPLE, OR ZITZ AND MUST PUNCH AND KICK THEIR WAY THROUGH SIX ENEMY-INFESTED STAGES TO SAVE THEIR ALTERNATE UNIVERSE FROM THE DARK QUEEN.

THE TOADS EACH VARY IN FIGHTING STYLE: RASH IS NIMBLE, PIMPLE IS BURLY AND STRONG, AND ZITZ IS A BALANCE OF THE TWO. EACH TOAD ALSO HAS ITS OWN SIGNATURE EXAGGERATED POWER AND ATTACK, IN WHICH THEIR LIMBS TURN INTO OBJECTS SUCH AS AXES AND DRILLS.

IN A VISUALLY UNIQUE TWIST, THE TOADS CAN KNOCK THE GAME'S ENEMIES 'OFF-SCREEN' SO THAT THEY APPEAR TO FLY TOWARDS THE PLAYERS, BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL. ENEMIES INCLUDE ALIENS, MUTANT RODENTS AND SNOWMEN.

THE GAME'S STAGES, IN ADDITION TO HAVING THEIR OWN UNIQUE VISUAL THEME, OFTEN DIFFER IN GAMEPLAY STYLE. SOME LEVELS ARE DOUBLE DRAGON-STYLE 2.5D BRAWLERS, WHILE OTHERS ARE STRICTLY TWO-DIMENSIONAL, PLATFORM-LIKE STAGES. IN ONE LEVEL, THE TOADS WEAR JET-PACKS AND DESCEND A TUNNEL AND IN THE FINAL LEVEL, THE TOADS SHOOT ENEMIES FROM A VEHICLE.</desc>

		<desc>THIS GAME WAS 2-PLAYER ONLY, YOU MUST HAVE A LIVE HUMAN OPPONENT TO PLAY AGAINST, OR ELSE THE OTHER PLAYERS MOUSE (THE GAMES PROMOTIONAL MATERIAL SAID THE CHARACTER WAS A MOUSE), WILL GO STRAIGHT INTO A WALL, MAKING FOR A VERY QUICK AND BORING GAME. EACH PLAYER MOVES THEIR MOUSE AROUND LEAVING A SOLID LINE BEHIND THEM. ALL MOVES ARE MADE ON AN INVISIBLE GRID, SO YOU CAN ONLY TURN AT 90 DEGREE ANGLES. SCATTERED AROUND THE GAMEBOARD ARE SEVERAL 'FEE' THAT YOU MUST AVOID, AS HITTING A FOOT IS JUST LIKE SMASHING INTO A WALL OR A LINE. TO WIN YOU MUST LAST LONGER THAN YOUR OPPONENT BEFORE HITTING SOMETHING (FIRST PERSON TO HIT SOMETHING LOSES). ONE GOOD STRATEGY IS TO TRY AND BOX YOUR OPPONENT IN TO A SMALL SECTION OF THE SCREEN, AND THEN JUST MOVE CAREFULLY UNTIL THEY CRASH. PUSHING BACKWARDS ON THE STICK WILL CAUSE YOU TO CRASH INTO YOUR OWN LINE, SO AVOID THAT AT ALL COST.</desc>

INGUZ BEGINS EACH STAGE AND EACH NEW LIFE WITH A FULL HEALTH METER OF EIGHTY UNITS, BUT FOOD CAN BE FOUND THAT WILL REPLENISH THE METER. THE PLAYER CAN LOSE A LIFE EITHER BY RUNNING OUT OF HEALTH, FALLING OFF THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN (OR INTO A HAZARD, SUCH AS A LAVA PIT), OR BY RUNNING OUT OF TIME. CLEARING EACH STAGE AWARDS BONUS POINTS BASED ON BOTH REMAINING TIME AND HEALTH UNITS.

CHECKPOINTS - INDICATED BY RED FLAGS - ARE LOCATED AT CERTAIN POINTS THROUGHOUT THE STAGES. IN THE EVENT OF LOSING A LIFE, PLAY RESTARTS FROM THE LAST CHECKPOINT REACHED. OBJECTS WITH INGUZ'S FACE ON THEM (SUCH AS WOODEN CHESTS AND BALLOONS) RELEASE BONUS ITEMS WHEN SHOT. 

AN ABSTRACT, ORIENTAL-LOOKING FACE OCCASIONALLY FORMS PART OF A LEVEL'S PLATFORM WHICH, WHEN SHOT, RELEASES BALLOONS WHICH CAN IN TURN BE SHOT FOR BONUS ITEMS. A GIANT FLYING HAT ALSO OCCASIONALLY APPEARS AND WILL DROP BONUS ITEMS WHEN SHOT. SMART BOMBS CAN ALSO BE FOUND AT CERTAIN POINTS THAT, WHEN RUN INTO BY INGUZ, WILL DAMAGE OR DESTROY ALL ENEMY TOYS ON SCREEN.</desc>

		<desc>WHILE THE GAME IS ESSENTIALLY A STANDARD HORIZONTALLY SCROLLING SHOOT'EM UP, IT HAS AN INNOVATION THAT MAKES IT UNIQUE IN THE GENRE. THE PLAYER FLIES A SPACESHIP (SPECIFICALLY, A BIOSHIP) WHICH HAS THE STANDARD FORWARD GUNS TO BE FOUND IN ALL HORIZONTAL SCROLLERS, BUT IT ALSO POSSESSES A WEAPON THAT CAN BE MANUALLY TARGETED WITH A CROSSHAIR, IN THE SAME MANNER AS IN THE GAME "MISSILE COMMAND". THIS ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO FIRE IN ANY DIRECTION WITH PINPOINT ACCURACY, AND ADDS AN EXTRA LEVEL OF STRATEGY TO THE GAME. THE PLAYER'S BIOSHIP CAN ALSO COLLECT POWER-UPS TO GROW BIGGER (BECOMING MORE POWERFUL), AND CAN ACQUIRE SPHERICAL PODS WHICH ATTACH TO THE SHIP AND INCREASE ITS FIREPOWER.</desc>

		<desc>BLACK DRAGON/TIGER IS A SCROLLING PLATFORM SHOOT-EM-UP SET IN A FANTASY WORLD AND IS THE SPIRITUAL SUCCESSOR TO THE CAPCOM CLASSIC, "MAKAIMURA" ("GHOSTS'N' GOBLINS" OUTSIDE JAPAN).

THE PLAYER TAKES ON THE ROLE OF A BARBARIAN HERO WHO MUST JUMP AND FIGHT HIS WAY THROUGH A VARIETY OF COLOURFUL, ENEMY-PACKED LEVELS, COLLECTING TREASURE AND WEAPON POWER-UPS AND RESCUING THE TRAPPED 'WISE OLD MEN' THAT LITTER THE LEVELS. 

RESCUING THE WISE MEN SEES THE PLAYER AWARDED 'ZENY COINS'; THESE ARE THE GAME'S CURRENCY AND ALLOW THE PLAYER TO BUY SUCH ITEMS AS WEAPON AND ARMOUR UPGRADES, KEYS FOR TREASURE CHESTS, ANTI-POISONING POTIONS AND HEALTH POTIONS FROM THE SHOPS THAT APPEAR ON EACH LEVEL. OCCASIONALLY, A RESCUED WISE MAN WILL ALSO OFFER TO SELL THE PLAYER WEAPON AND ARMOUR POWER-UPS. 

THE BARBARIAN HERO IS ARMED WITH A SPIKED MACE ON THE END OF A LONG CHAIN, AS WELL AS UNLIMITED THROWING DAGGERS. BOTH THESE AND THE ARMOUR WORN BY THE BARBARIAN (WHICH OFFERS LIMITED PROTECTION FROM ENEMY ATTACKS) CAN BE UPGRADED BY FINDING OR BUYING THE RELEVANT POWER-UPS.

THE SPRAWLING, EIGHT-WAY SCROLLING LEVELS ARE PACKED WITH HIDDEN BONUSES TO ENCOURAGE AND REWARD EXPLORATION. THESE BONUSES ARE IN THE FORM OF WEAPON AND ARMOUR POWER-UPS, AS WELL AS VALUABLE TREASURE ITEMS. MANY LEVELS ALSO INCLUDE A HIDDEN DUNGEON AND EACH DUNGEON IS FILLED WITH BOTH BONUS ITEMS AND TRAPPED WISE MEN.

SPECIAL ITEMS THAT REVEAL COINS, UPGRADED ARMOUR, OR SIMPLY BONUS POINTS CAN BE FOUND BY ATTACKING CERTAIN WALLS.</desc>

AS IN MANY OTHER VERTICAL SCROLLING SHOOTERS (INCLUDING NAMCO'S OWN XEVIOUS), THE PLAYER CONTROLS A SHIP, FACING THE TOP OF THE SCREEN, THAT CAN MOVE FREELY WHILE THE BACKGROUND SCROLLS DOWN, BRINGING ENEMIES IN TO VIEW; THE PLAYER MAY DESTROY ENEMIES FOR POINTS. THE GAME USES TWO BUTTONS - ONE IS USED TO MAKE THE SHIP FIRE CIRCULAR LASERS, WHILE THE OTHER IS USED TO CYCLE THROUGH ITS FOUR FIRING PATTERNS. THE RED PATTERN IS TWO LASERS IN A SPIRAL PATTERN, WHILE THE BLUE ONE IS ONE LASER STRAIGHT AHEAD AND ONE BEHIND, THE YELLOW ONE IS ONE LASER STRAIGHT AHEAD, ONE LEFT, AND ONE RIGHT AND THE GREEN ONE IS TWO LASERS DIAGONALLY FORWARD (ONE TO THE LEFT AND ONE TO THE RIGHT), AND ONE STRAIGHT BEHIND; BY HOLDING DOWN THE BUTTON, THE SHIP FIRES MORE POWERFUL, SPHERICAL LASERS.</desc>

		<desc>THE PLAYER TAKES CONTROL OF A SPACESHIP AND MUST FIGHT AGAINST WAVE AFTER WAVE OF ENEMY FIGHTERS, WHILE TRYING TO RESCUE THE STRANDED ASTRONAUTS THAT REPRESENT THE LAST SURVIVING REMNANTS OF THE HUMAN RACE. ENEMIES ATTACK THE PLAYER BOTH WITH WEAPONS, AND BY MAKING 'SUICIDE RUNS' AT THE PLAYER'S SHIP. THE GAME CONSISTS OF ELEVEN DIFFERENT LEVELS, NINE OF WHICH ARE REPEATED, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF LEVELS TO 20. 

THE LEVELS ARE: PLANETOID WAVES, ROBOT GRID WAVES, SAUCERLAND WAVES, VAMPIRE WAVES, TIME TUNNEL WAVES, OUTER SPACE WAVES, ENDURO WAVES, CAT WORLD WAVES, AND MASTERMIND WAVES (THERE ARE TWO OF EACH OF THESE). 

THERE ARE ALSO TWO UNIQUE WAVES THAT OCCUR ONLY ONCE, THEY ARE ARMAGEDDON AND PARADISE. 

PLAYERS CAN SELECT THEIR STARTING WAVE AT THE START OF THE GAME; CHOOSING FROM PLANETOIDS, ROBOT GRID, SAUCERLAND, AND VAMPIRES. DURING THE GAME, PLAYERS MUST BE CAREFUL TO NOT SHOOT THE HUMAN ASTRONAUTS THAT DRIFT THROUGH THE LEVELS. THESE MUST BE RESCUED BY 'RUNNING' INTO THEM. 

DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF AN ENERGY METER, THE PLAYER CAN TAKE EXACTLY THREE HITS BEFORE HE OR SHE DIES. UPON DEATH, THE WINDOW OF THE PLAYER'S VIRTUAL COCKPIT BREAKS AND ONE OF THE PLAYER'S LIVES IS LOST. BLASTER HAS A 'CONTINUE' OPTION BUT THIS CAN ONLY BE USED ONCE.</desc>

		<desc>BLASTEROIDS IS A 1 OR 2-PLAYER UPDATE OF ATARI'S SEMINAL "ASTEROIDS", WHERE THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO CLEAR ALL SECTORS OF THE ASTEROIDS AND ENEMY SHIPS. ONCE THIS TASK IS COMPLETED, THE PLAYER GOES ON TO BATTLE MUKOR - THE "BOSS" ASTEROID WHO RULES ALL GALAXIES - AND DESTROY HIM.

THE PLAYER'S SHIP APPEARS FIRST IN THE CENTER OF FOUR VORTICES, HE OR SHE MUST CHOSE WHICH VORTEX THEY WISH TO ENTER, WHICH THEN TRANSPORTS THEM TO A SECTOR OF THEIR CHOSEN STAR SYSTEM.

UNLIKE IN "ASTEROIDS", THE PLAYER SHIP HAS A FINITE AMOUNT OF FUEL WHICH MUST BE REPLENISHED AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY DESTROYING SPECIFICALLY-COLORED ASTEROIDS WHICH TURN INTO COLLECTIBLE CRYSTALS. NOT ALL SECTORS CONTAIN THE CRYSTAL-BEARING ASTEROIDS, HOWEVER, AND IF THE PLAYER RUNS OUT OF FUEL, A SHIP IS LOST. THE GAME CONTAINS THREE DIFFERENT SHIP CONFIGURATIONS AND THE PLAYER CAN SWITCH BETWEEN THEM AT ANY TIME DURING A LEVEL. THE THREE CONFIGURATIONS ARE: SPEEDER (SMALL AND FAST, BUT WEAK), FIGHTER (MEDIUM SPEED AND STRENGTH) AND WARRIOR (LARGE AND STRONG BUT VERY SLOW).</desc>

THE PLAYER CAN THEN FLY INTO THE OUTLINE, AND TAKE ON THE FORM OF THE ENEMY ROBOT, TAKING CONTROL OF ITS WEAPONS, ABILITIES AND SPECIAL ATTACKS.

THERE IS ALSO ADDITION TO THE BOSS BATTLE SCORING: SIMILAR TO SOME SHOOTERS, PLAYERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE THEIR SCORES BY BEATING THE END LEVEL BOSSES WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME LIMIT. EVERY TIME A BOSS BATTLE IS INITIATED, A TIMER WILL COUNT DOWN AND ONCE THE BOSS IS DESTROYED/KILLED BEFORE THE TIMER REACHES ZERO, THEN THE TIME LEFT WILL ADD TO THE PLAYER'S END-LEVEL SCORE; IF THE TIMER RUNS OUT, THEN THE SCORE AT THE END OF THE LEVEL WILL REMAIN UNAFFECTED.</desc>

		<name>Block Out</name>
		<desc>BLOCK OUT IS A 1-PLAYER OR A SIMULTANEOUS 2 PLAYERS COMPETITIVE GAME OF UNIQUE DIMENSIONAL ACTION AND STRATEGY.
AS THE BLOCKS DROP ONE-BY-ONE INTO THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL PIT, ROTATE THEM BY USING THE THREE BUTTONS AND JOYSTICK. ONCE THE PLAYER HAS DECIDED ON THE THE ROTATION OF THE BLOCK, USE THE BUTTON TO DROP THE BLOCK INTO PLACE. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PLACE THE BLOCKS INTO THE PIT WITHOUT LEAVING ANY EMPTY SPACES. ONCE THIS IS ACHIEVED, THE LAYERS WITHOUT EMPTY SPACES, WILL DISAPPEAR.

THE PLAYER BEGINS THE GAME BY SELECTING A STARTING STAGE. GAME START LEVEL SELECT CAN BE CHOSEN FROM STAGES 1, 5, 10, 15, OR 20. THERE IS A TOTAL OF 100 STAGES IN THE GAME AND AS THE PLAYERS PROGRESS THROUGH THE GAME, THE STAGES GET MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT.
EACH STAGE HAS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF LAYERS (FACES) THAT MUST BE ERASED. ONCE THESE FACES ARE ERASED, THE PLAYER WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STAGE. THE LESS BLOCKS THE PLAYERS HAS LEFT IN THE PIT AT THE END OF THE STAGE, THE MORE POINTS ARE AWARDED.

IN ADDITION TO THE ONE PLAYER MODE, BLOCK OUT OFFERS A COMPETITIVE SIMULTANEOUS TWO PLAYER MODE. THE SPLIT SCREEN EFFECT GIVES EACH PLAYER THEIR OWN PIT WITH WHICH TO PLAY IN. THEY COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER IN THE RACE TO ERASE THE FACES. AS ONE PLAYER ERASES A FACE, THAT FACE WILL BE ADDED TO THE OPPONENT'S PIT, MAKING THEIR PIT RISE. THIS ALLOWS LESS ROOM TO WORK. THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO WIN IN THE 2-PLAYER MODE:
1) FORCE THE OPPONENT TO THE TOP OF THEIR PIT AND OUT OF THE GAME
OR
2) ERASE 21 FACES FIRST.</desc>

BLOODSTORM WAS DUBBED AS A POSSIBLE MK-KILLER IN AN ATTEMPT TO SURPASS RIVAL MIDWAY'S SUCCESS WITH MORTAL KOMBAT, THOUGH IT DID NOT PREVAIL. IT WAS THE LAST GAME STRATA PRODUCED BEFORE THE COMPANY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS.

AS WITH ITS PREDECESSOR TIME KILLERS, BLOODSTORM FEATURES MANY OF THE ASPECTS CARRIED DOWN FROM IT, SUCH AS THE REMOVAL OF AN OPPONENT S ARMS AND AN INSTANT KILL ATTACK, AS WELL AS A SPECIAL DEATH MOVE. THE BUTTON LAYOUT IS VIRTUALLY THE SAME. THEY ARE LABELED AS "BACK LEG", "FRONT LEG", "BACK ARM" AND "FRONT ARM" RESPECTIVELY. A BUTTON IN THE CENTER IS USED TO MAKE THE CHARACTER BLOCK.

		<name>Bomb Jack</name>
		<desc>BOMB JACK IS A FAST-MOVING PLATFORM GAME IN WHICH THE AIM IS TO COLLECT ALL OF THE BOMBS ON EACH LEVEL BEFORE PROGRESSING TO THE NEXT. A VARIETY OF CONSTANTLY SPAWNING MECHANICAL ENEMIES PATROL THE PLATFORMS AND AIRSPACE SO THE LONGER A PLAYER TAKES TO COLLECT ALL OF THE BOMBS, THE MORE DIFFICULT PROGRESS BECOMES. 

EXTRA POINT BONUSES ARE AWARDED FOR COLLECTING BOMBS WITH THEIR FUSES LIT. ONLY ONE BOMB AT ANY TIME HAS A LIT FUSE, AND COLLECTING TWENTY OR MORE OF THESE LIT BOMBS ON ANY GIVEN LEVEL WILL EARN THE PLAYER POINTS BONUS (SEE TIPS AND TRICKS FOR DETAILS). JACK IS PURSUED AROUND EACH LEVEL BY THE SPAWNING ENEMIES AND WHEN HE GETS KILLED, HE DROPS DOWN TO THE NEAREST PLATFORM, ALWAYS LANDING ON HIS HEAD. 

A 'POWERBALL' APPEARS AT SEMI-REGULAR INTERVALS AND MOVES DIAGONALLY AROUND THE SCREEN. IF THE PLAYER MANAGES TO GRAB THIS, ALL OF THE LEVEL'S MONSTERS ARE FROZEN FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AND CAN THEN BE KILLED BY HAVING JACK FLY INTO THEM (SIMILAR TO THE 'POWERPILL' FEATURE IN "PAC-MAN"). COLLECTING THE BONUS 'B' SYMBOLS WILL INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF POINTS AWARDED FOR COLLECTING BOMBS WITH THEIR FUSES LIT. PICKING UP AN 'EXTRA' SYMBOL AWARDS THE PLAYER WITH AN ADDITIONAL LIFE, WHILE CATCHING THE 'SPECIAL' SYMBOL WILL GIVE THE PLAYER AN EXTRA CREDIT. 

EACH OF BOMB JACK'S LEVELS FEATURE ONE OF FIVE DIFFERENT BACKGROUND PICTURES, SOME OF WHICH REPRESENT FAMOUS HISTORICAL LANDMARKS. THEY ARE: THE SPHINX IN EGYPT, THE ACROPOLIS IN GREECE, CASTLE NEUSCHWANSTEIN IN BAVARIA, SKYSCRAPERS AND A CITYSCAPE BY NIGHT. WHILE THE BACKGROUNDS THEMSELVES ARE REPEATED AS THE GAME PROGRESSES, THE PLATFORM LAYOUTS FOR EACH LEVEL ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. AT LEAST UNTIL LEVEL 18, AFTER WHICH THE LEVELS ARE REPEATED. 

THE BASIC PLAY MECHANIC OF COLLECTING OBJECTS TO CLEAR A LEVEL, AS WELL AS THE POWERBALL FEATURE, IS HUGELY REMINISCENT OF NAMCO'S SEMINAL "PAC-MAN".</desc>

		<name>Bombjack Twin</name>
		<desc>BOMB JACK TWIN IS A DIRECT SEQUEL TO THE 1984 ORIGINAL AND RETAINS THE SAME PLATFORM-BASED COLLECT-THE-BOMBS GAMEPLAY OF ITS PREDECESSOR.

CHANGES OVER THE ORIGINAL GAME INCLUDE A SLIGHTLY FASTER PLAYING TEMPO AND THE OPTION FOR SIMULTANEOUS TWO-PLAYER ACTION. AS WITH THE PREQUEL, EXTRA POINTS AND BONUSES CAN BE EARNED BY COLLECTING BONUS COINS AND BOMBS WITH THEIR FUSES STILL LIT. BOMB JACK TWIN ALSO RETAINS THE 'POWERBALL' FEATURE OF ITS PREDECESSOR WHICH, WHEN COLLECTED, FREEZES THE LEVEL'S ENEMIES FOR SEVERAL SECONDS, ALLOWING THEM TO BE DESTROYED.

THE WAY THE SEQUEL'S LEVELS ARE STRUCTURED DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE ORIGINAL GAME. IN "BOMB JACK", EACH SCREEN WAS SIMPLY NUMBERED SEQUENTIALLY AND THE BACKGROUND PICTURE CHANGED ON EVERY SCREEN, BUT THE STAGES IN "BOMB JACK TWIN" ARE GROUPED INTO 'ROUNDS', EACH CONSISTING OF THREE SCREEN LAYOUTS BUT RETAINING A SINGLE BACKGROUND PICTURE FOR THE DURATION OF THAT ROUND.

ANOTHER NEW ADDITION IS THE BONUS SCREEN. THIS APPEARS EVERY COUPLE OF ROUNDS AND PLAYERS MUST TRY TO COLLECT ALL BOMBS ON THE SCREEN WITHIN A TIGHT TIME LIMIT TO EARN EXTRA BONUS POINTS. THERE ARE NO ENEMIES ON THE BONUS SCREENS AND THE BACKGROUND IS PLAIN BLACK.

AS WITH THE FIRST GAME, "BOMB JACK TWIN" TAKES PLACE IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. A MAP SCREEN IS DISPLAYED BEFORE THE START OF EACH NEW ROUND SHOWING THE NEXT LOCATION. THE AVAILABLE LOCATIONS ARE: GERMANY, THAILAND, NEVADA, JAPAN, ENGLAND, HONG KONG AND CHINA.</desc>

		<desc>A CLASSIC 1 OR 2-PLAYER WESTERN GUNFIGHT GAME, FEATURING A MONOCHROME DISPLAY OVERLAID VIA MIRROR ONTO BACK-LIT PLASTIC BACKGROUND. EACH PLAYER USES A SMALL JOYSTICK TO MOVE THEIR COWBOY UP AND DOWN THE PLAY AREA, WHILE A SECOND, MUCH LARGER JOYSTICK IS USED TO AIM THE PISTOL AND SHOOT - THIS LARGER STICK ALSO HAS A TRIGGER BUTTON. THE GAME'S SINGLE GOAL IS SIMPLY TO SHOOT THE OTHER PLAYER, WHO IS SITUATED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE GAME AREA. WAGONS AND CACTI LITTER THE MIDDLE OF THE PLAY AREA, PROVIDING TEMPORARY COVER FROM THE OPPONENT'S GUNFIRE (WHILE, OF COURSE, PROVIDING THE OPPONENT WITH COVER FROM THE PLAYER'S SHOTS). THESE OBSTACLES SLOWLY DISINTEGRATE AS THEY ARE SHOT; MUCH LIKE THE SHIELDS IN TAITO'S "SPACE INVADERS".

BOOT HILL IS TIME-BASED NOT LIFE BASED, WITH THE FACTORY DEFAULT SET AT NINETY SECONDS. THIS IS, OF COURSE, OPERATOR ADJUSTABLE VIA THE DIP SETTINGS. THE COMPUTER OPPONENT IS QUITE EASY TO BEAT WITH A LITTLE PRACTICE, BUT A HUMAN OPPONENT PROVIDES A MUCH STRONGER CHALLENGE.</desc>

		<desc>BUCK ROGERS: PLANET OF ZOOM IS A FORWARD-SCROLLING RAIL SHOOTER WHERE THE USER CONTROLS A SPACESHIP IN A BEHIND-THE-BACK THIRD-PERSON PERSPECTIVE THAT MUST DESTROY ENEMY SHIPS AND AVOID OBSTACLES. THE GAME WAS NOTABLE FOR ITS FAST PSEUDO 3-D SCALING AND DETAILED SPRITES. THE GAME WOULD LATER GO ON TO INFLUENCE THE 1985 SEGA HIT SPACE HARRIER. BUCK IS NEVER SEEN IN THE GAME, EXCEPT PRESUMABLY IN THE ILLUSTRATION ON THE SIDE OF THE ARCADE CABINET, AND ITS ONLY REAL CONNECTIONS TO BUCK ROGERS ARE THE USE OF THE NAME AND THE OUTER SPACE SETTING. IN JAPAN, THE GAME WAS KNOWN AS ZOOM 909.</desc>

THE CHEF MUST CREATE A SET NUMBER OF BURGERS PER LEVEL BY COLLECTING THE SEPARATE INGREDIENTS NEEDED TO MAKE EACH ONE (TWO PIECES OF BUN, THE BURGER ITSELF AND/OR A GARNISH, SUCH AS LETTUCE OR CHEESE). 

EACH SCREEN IS MADE UP OF PLATFORMS JOINED BY CONNECTING LADDERS. AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN ARE A NUMBER OF EMPTY PLATES WHILE THE BURGER INGREDIENTS LAY ACROSS THE PLATFORMS DIRECTLY ABOVE THE PLATES. THE CHEF MUST WALK ACROSS THE ENTIRE WIDTH OF THE INGREDIENTS TO MAKE THEM DROP TO THE PLATFORM BELOW. A BURGER IS ONLY COMPLETED ONCE ALL OF ITS INGREDIENTS HAVE BEEN DROPPED ONTO THE CORRESPONDING PLATE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. 

THE CHEF'S EFFORTS ARE HAMPERED BY THE ROGUE INGREDIENTS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY CHASING HIM. THEY ARE CALLED 'MR. HOT DOG', 'MR. EGG' AND 'MR. PICKLE'. ANY CONTACT WITH THEM RESULTS IN THE LOSS OF A LIFE. THE CHEF CAN TEMPORARILY FREEZE THE ENEMIES BY THROWING PEPPER AT THEM. HE ONLY CARRIES A LIMITED AMOUNT OF PEPPER BUT THIS CAN BE REPLENISHED BY COLLECTING THE BONUS FOOD ITEMS THAT RANDOMLY APPEAR (ICE CREAM CONES, COFFEE, AND FRIES). IN ADDITION TO THE PEPPER, ANY ENEMIES LOCATED ON A PLATFORM BELOW THE CHEF CAN BE KILLED BY DROPPING AN AVAILABLE BURGER INGREDIENT ON TOP OF THEM. .</desc>

THE GAME IS AN INTO-THE-SCREEN SHOOTER WITH THE ACTION VIEWED FROM AN OVER-THE-SHOULDER PERSPECTIVE. THE COMMANDOS CAN MOVE LEFT AND RIGHT TO AVOID INCOMING FIRE WHILE THE ENEMIES THEMSELVES ARE TARGETED BY MOVING AN ON-SCREEN CROSS-HAIR OVER THEM AND PRESSING FIRE. IF THE FIRE BUTTON IS HELD DOWN, THE COMMANDO REMAINS STATIC, ALLOWING FOR MORE ACCURATE TARGETING OF THE CROSS-HAIR. WHILE STATIC, THE COMMANDOS ARE VULNERABLE TO INCOMING ENEMY FIRE.

INITIALLY, THE COMMANDOS ARE ARMED WITH ONLY A STANDARD SINGLE-SHOT GUN (ALBEIT WITH UNLIMITED-AMMUNITION) AND A LIMITED NUMBER OF GRENADES, BUT ADDITIONAL GRENADES AND WEAPON POWER-UPS CAN BE EARNED AS PLAY PROGRESSES.

AS WELL AS ENEMY TROOPS, VEHICLES SUCH AS TANKS, ARMOURED CARS AND HELICOPTERS ALSO APPEAR AND TAKE NUMEROUS SHOTS TO DESTROY. WHEN DESTROYED OR KILLED, SOME ON-SCREEN TARGETS RELEASE POINTS BONUSES AND WEAPON POWER-UPS THAT DROP TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND CAN BE PICKED UP BY THE COMMANDOS. WEAPON POWER-UPS INCLUDE ADDITIONAL GRENADES, A RAPID-FIRE MACHINE AND AN AUTOMATIC SHOTGUN, WHICH HAS A SLIGHTLY LOWER FIRING RATE BUT HAS A LARGER TARGETING CROSS-HAIR, ALLOWING IT TO STRIKE A WIDER AREA WITH EACH SHOT.

EACH OF THE GAME'S SCREENS IS LITTERED WITH BUILDINGS AND BARRICADES THAT CAN ALSO BE DESTROYED. THIS REMOVES ENEMY COVER AS WELL AS EARNING PLAYERS BONUS POINTS.</desc>

		<desc>CALIBER FIFTY IS A MULTI-DIRECTIONAL SCROLLING SHOOT-EM-UP FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS TAKING ON THE ROLES OF CAPTURED US PILOTS WHO HAVE BEEN TAKEN PRISONER DURING THE VIETNAM WAR IN 1972. THE PILOTS MUST ESCAPE THE PRISON COMPOUND BY BATTLING ENEMY SOLDIERS AND VEHICLES, INCLUDING TANKS PLANES AND HELICOPTERS.

THE GAME IS VERY SIMILAR IN PLAY TO SNK'S IKARI AND HEAVY BARREL GAMES, WITH PLAYERS ABLE TO FULLY ROTATE THEIR ON-SCREEN CHARACTERS TO FIRE AND MOVE IN ALL DIRECTIONS. PLAYERS ARE INITIALLY ARMED WITH A MACHINE GUN AND LIMITED NUMBER OF GRENADES BUT POWER-UPS - INCLUDING A ROCKET LAUNCHER, A FLAMETHROWER AND GRENADES - CAN BE FOUND IN THE DESTRUCTIBLE WOODEN CRATES THAT LITTER THE STAGES. 

ENEMY VEHICLES SUCH AS A PLANE CAN ALSO BE COMMANDEERED AND THE STAGES TAKE PLACE BOTH ABOVE GROUND IN THE VIETNAMESE JUNGLES AND BELOW GROUND IN HIDDEN TUNNELS. CALIBER FIFTY IS A QUITE SHORT BUT VERY CHALLENGING GAME, WITH CONSTANTLY SPAWNING ENEMIES ATTACKING FROM ALL SIDES.</desc>

EACH MAZE MUST BE COMPLETED WITHIN A TIGHT TIME LIMIT AND A NUMBER OF TRAPS AND OBSTACLES LITTER THE MAZES TO SLOW PLAYERS DOWN.

THERE ARE, HOWEVER, A NUMBER OF POSITIVE TARGETS TO BE HIT, AND BONUSES - SUCH AS ADDITIONAL TIME - CAN BE FOUND HIDDEN AWAY WITHIN THE MAZES. WHEN THE BALL IS STUCK OR THE PLAYER WOULD LIKE TO SPEED UP, THE JUMP BUTTON CAN BE USED. IF THE PLAYER RUNS OUT OF TIME BEFORE REACHING THE GOAL, A RANDOM MATCHING GAME IS RUN TO ALLOW THE PLAYER MORE TIME TO COMPLETE THE MAZE. THIS CHALLENGE, HOWEVER IS VERY DIFFICULT TO WIN.</desc>

		<desc>CENTIPEDE IS A VERTICALLY ORIENTED SINGLE SCREEN SHOOT-EM-UP IN WHICH THE AIM IS TO USE THE 'BUG BLASTER' TO SHOOT THE CENTIPEDES THAT SNAKE DOWN TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN TO AMASS AS HIGH A SCORE AS POSSIBLE. 

THE PLAY-FIELD IS LITTERED WITH RANDOMLY PLACED MUSHROOMS AND THE RAPIDLY DESCENDING CENTIPEDE CHANGES DIRECTION WHEN IT RUNS INTO A MUSHROOM. WHEN A SEGMENT OF THE CENTIPEDE IS SHOT, THE SEGMENT IS DESTROYED AND A MUSHROOM APPEARS IN ITS PLACE, THE CENTIPEDE THEN BREAKS INTO TWO SMALLER CENTIPEDES, EACH WITH ITS OWN HEAD, AND CONTINUES ITS DESCENT. 

PLAYERS CAN MOVE THE BUG BLASTER VERTICALLY AS WELL AS HORIZONTALLY, ALTHOUGH ONLY FOR THE LOWER FIFTH OF THE PLAY-FIELD. MUSHROOMS CAN ALSO BE SHOT FOR POINTS AND TO CLEAR BLOCKED AREAS. ONCE A CENTIPEDE REACHES THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, IT STARTS SNAKING BACK UP, BUT REMAINS WITHIN THE LOWER SECTION OF THE PLAY-FIELD NEAR THE PLAYER'S BUG BLASTER.

ADDITIONALLY, ANY CENTIPEDE THAT REACHES THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN WITHOUT BEING SHOT RELEASES ITS TAIL SECTION WHICH THEN BECOMES A NEW HEAD. OTHER NEW HEADS ALSO ENTER THE SCREEN FROM THE BOTTOM CORNERS OF THE PLAY-FIELD AS TIME PROGRESSES.

RANDOMLY MOVING SPIDERS ALSO APPEAR IN THE FIRST WAVE. SPIDERS CAN DESTROY ANY MUSHROOMS THEY MOVE OVER, ELIMINATING MANY MUSHROOM TARGETS FOR A PLAYER. IF THE BUG BLASTER AND A SPIDER COLLIDE, BOTH ARE DESTROYED. THE SPIDER EITHER MOVES AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE OR VERTICALLY UP AND DOWN, NEVER SIMPLY LEFT OR RIGHT LIKE THE CENTIPEDE DOES.

A BOMBARDMENT OF FLEAS APPEARS FROM THE SECOND WAVE ONWARD. AS A FLEA DESCENDS, IT LEAVES A TRAIL OF NEW MUSHROOMS BEHIND IT. FLEAS APPEAR WHEN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MUSHROOMS REMAINS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. THIS NUMBER INCREASES AS THE GAME PROGRESSES, MEANING FLEAS APPEAR MORE OFTEN LATER ON IN THE GAME. THE BUG BLASTER MUST HIT A FLEA TWICE TO DESTROY IT; THE FIRST SHOT SIMPLY SPEEDS UP ITS DESCENT.

WHEN A CENTIPEDE WITH FEWER THAN ELEVEN SEGMENTS APPEARS, A SCORPION ENTERS FROM EITHER SIDE, MOVING AT A RELATIVELY SLOW SPEED. AS THE PLAYER EARNS MORE POINTS, THE SCORPION'S SPEED INCREASES. AS THE SCORPION TRAVELS ACROSS THE SCREEN, IT 'POISONS' THE MUSHROOMS THAT IT MOVES OVER AND CHANGES THEIR COLOURS. THESE MUSHROOMS CAUSE ANY CENTIPEDES THAT WOULD COLLIDE WITH THEM TO HEAD STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, RATHER THAN CONTINUE SNAKING LEFT AND RIGHT. THE BUG BLASTER CAN STOP A POISONED CENTIPEDE BY SHOOTING ITS HEAD.

IF A PLAYER EARNS AT LEAST 60,000 POINTS, TWO THINGS HAPPEN TO INCREASE THE CHALLENGE: THE FLEAS DESCEND AT A FASTER SPEED AND THE SPIDERS RESTRICT THEIR MOVEMENT TO A SMALLER AREA AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.</desc>

THE GAME PUTS THE PLAYER IN THE ROLE OF MR. CHACK'N, WHO MUST RESCUE ALL OF THE HEARTS THAT WERE STOLEN DURING A ROMANTIC INTERLUDE BETWEEN HIM AND MISS CHACK'N. CHACK IS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER WITH INTERESTING ABILITIES. HE CAN TOSS TWO BOMBS, ONLY ONE IN EACH DIRECTION AT A TIME. HE CAN ALSO EFFORTLESSLY GO FROM WALKING ON THE FLOOR TO WALKING ON THE CEILING. IF THE CEILING IS LOW ENOUGH, CHACK CAN EXTEND HIS LEGS UNTIL HIS HEAD TOUCHES THE CEILING TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN WALKING ON IT.</desc>

THE GAME CONSISTS OF 16 SECTORS (ROUNDS) OF PLAY. SECTOR 1 BEGINS WITH LARGE ENERGY RINGS FLOATING RANDOMLY ACROSS THE SCREEN. THE SPACESHIP MUST AVOID COLLIDING WITH THE RINGS, OR IT WILL EXPLODE INTO A STARBURST OF BRILLIANT COLORS. THE SPACESHIP DODGES THE ENERGY RINGS BY MOVING RIGHT OR LEFT ACROSS THE PLAYFIELD, WHILE BURSTING THEM WITH THE SPACESHIP'S 3-DIRECTIONAL GUNS. BURSTING THE LARGE RINGS (100 POINTS) BREAKS THEM INTO MEDIUM RINGS. BURSTING THE MEDIUM RINGS (200 POINTS) BREAKS THEM INTO SMALL RINGS. BURSTING THE SMALL RINGS (400 POINTS) CAUSES THEM TO DISINTEGRATE.</desc>

AS WELL AS WALKING ALONG THE PLATFORMS AND POLES, THE CHAMELEON CAN USE ITS TONGUE TO PULL ITSELF UP TO HIGHER PLATFORMS; AND TO ESCAPE FROM ANY NEARBY CHICKENS. EACH LEVEL ALSO HAS A NUMBER OF BOMBS PLACED AT VARIOUS POINTS; THE CHAMELEON CAN HIT THESE WITH ITS TONGUE TO SEND THEM CRASHING TOWARDS NEARBY CHICKENS. THE PLAYER MUST KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR PROJECTILES THROWN BY THE CHICKENS, SUCH AS FLASHING EGGS.

IF THE NESTING EGGS ARE LEFT FOR TOO LONG, THEY WILL HATCH INTO A BABY CHICK. THE PLAYER CAN EAT THE CHICK FOR BONUS POINTS, BUT IF THE CHICK IS LEFT ALONE FOR TOO LONG, IT WILL GROW INTO AN ADULT CHICKEN AND START ATTACKING THE PLAYER.

A LEVEL IS OVER ONCE ALL OF THE EGGS HAVE BEEN COLLECTED AND ALL OF THE CHICKENS KILLED.</desc>

		<name>Championship Sprint</name>
		<desc>CHAMPIONSHIP SPRINT IS AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE OLD ATARI SPRINT SERIES, WITH THE ADDED ABILITY FOR PLAYERS TO UPGRADE THEIR VEHICLES AS THE GAME PROGRESSES. UPGRADES ARE WON BY COLLECTING THE BONUS WRENCHES THAT APPEAR ONCE DURING EACH RACE, AND ONCE PLAYERS HAVE COLLECTED FOUR WRENCHES, THEY WILL BE PRESENTED WITH AN UPGRADE SCREEN; ALLOWING THEM TO CHOOSE BETTER TRACTION, TOP SPEED, ACCELERATION, OR A FASTER HELICOPTER.

COLLISIONS WITH BARRIERS SHOULD, OF COURSE, BE AVOIDED, AS THEY INVARIABLY COST THE PLAYER VALUABLE TIME. ALSO; A DIRECT, HEAD-ON COLLISION CAN CAUSE THE PLAYERS' VEHICLES TO EXPLODE - PARTICULARLY IF THE PLAYER IS MOVING AT SPEED WHEN THIS HAPPENS. IN THE EVENT OF A CAR EXPLODING, A HELICOPTER WILL AUTOMATICALLY AIRLIFT A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE TO THE TRACK; THIS REPLACEMENT WILL RETAIN ANY PREVIOUS UPGRADES MADE BY THE PLAYER. WAITING FOR THE REPLACEMENT CAR TAKES PRECIOUS TIME AND ALLOWS RIVAL DRIVERS TO GAIN A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE. CAR REPLACEMENT TIME CAN BE SHORTENED UPGRADING THE HELICOPTER.

THE TRACKS THEMSELVES ARE ALL VARIATIONS ON THE BASIC 'OVAL', WITH GATES, JUMPS, RAMPS AND CROSSROADS ENSURING A DEMANDING, YET INCREDIBLY PLAYABLE GAME.</desc>

THE CATERPILLAR MUST EAT ALL THE STRAWBERRIES AND NUTS ON EACH LEVEL TO BECOME A BUTTERFLY. EATING A STRAWBERRY TEMPORARILY MAKES THE CATERPILLAR INVINCIBLE ALLOWING IT TO KILL THE DEADLY BUGS AND SCORE 400 BONUS POINTS BER BUG. IF THE CATERPILLAR REMAINS STILL FOR TOO LONG, AN INVINCIBLE OWL (REPLACED BY AN INVINCIBLE BAT IN LATER LEVELS) WILL APPEAR. IF YOUR CATEPILLAR MOVES, THE OWL OR BAT WILL DISAPPEAR.  IF YOUR CATEPILLAR REMAINS STILL, THE INVINCIBLE OWL OR BAT WILL CHASE THE CATERPILLAR, ALBIET NOT VERY EFFRCTIVELY.  

WHEN THE CATERPILLAR CROSSES OVER A PIVOT BRANCH, ALL THE BRANCHES WILL ROTATE AT ONCE, AND ANY BUGS THAT ARE ON THOSE BRANCHES WILL FALL OFF AND SCORE 400, 800, 1600 AND 3200 POINTS, DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF BUGS KILLED. KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR THE FLOWERS THAT WILL APPEAR BELOW THE HOUSE - THEY WILL REWARD YOU BETWEEN 400 AND 3200 POINTS, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL.</desc>

		<name>Chiller</name>
		<desc>THIS IS A GUN GAME, AND THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT SCREENS (PLUS TWO DIFFERENT BONUS SCREENS). THE OBJECT IS SIMPLY TO SHOOT EVERYTHING IN SIGHT (AND TO TRY AND LOCATE ANY HIDDEN TARGETS ON THE SCREEN). THE GAME IS BASED ON TIME, AND THE TIMER MOVES FASTER WHEN YOU ARE SHOOTING POORLY.
THE FIRST SCREEN IS A TORTURE CHAMBER. THERE ARE FOUR (STILL LIVING) HUMAN TARGETS ON THIS SCREEN. FROM LEFT TO RIGHT THEY ARE; A MAN CHAINED TO THE WALL, A PERSON IN A GUILLOTINE (SHOOT THE TOP OF THE GUILLOTINE TO DECAPITATE THEM), A WOMAN STRAPPED IN A STRANGE MACHINE, AND A MAN IN A HEAD VISE (SHOOT THE VISE TO CRUSH HIS HEAD). THE REST OF THE ROOM IS STREWN WITH BLOOD AND LOOSE BODY PARTS. YOU DON'T SIMPLY SHOOT EACH TARGET ONCE, INSTEAD YOU SHOOT EACH PART OF THE TARGET, WHICH REDUCES THAT PART TO A MESS OF BLOOD AND BONES. THIS IS THANKFULLY THE MOST DISTURBING LEVEL IN THE GAME.
THE SECOND ROOM IS ANOTHER TORTURE CHAMBER WITH A RIVER OF BLOOD FLOWING THROUGH THE MIDDLE. THIS ONE HAS FIVE HUMAN TARGETS; A MAN STRAPPED TO A BOARD, A MAN CHAINED TO THE FLOOR, TWO PEOPLE ON STRETCHING RACKS (SHOOT THE WHEELS TO PULL THEM APART), AND A WOMAN HUNG FROM ROPE OVER THE RIVER (SHOOT A PULLEY TO SLOWLY LOWER HER INTO THE RIVER TO BE EATEN BY CROCODILES). BODY PARTS WILL FLOW DOWN THE RIVER RANDOMLY, AND A MAN WILL POP OUT OF A DOOR FROM TIME TO TIME TO TOSS A BLADE INTO ONE OF THE HELPLESS VICTIMS.
THE THIRD LEVEL IS A HAUNTED HOUSE HALLWAY. THERE IS ONLY ONE HUMAN VICTIM ON THIS LEVEL. IT IS A WOMAN WHO RUNS FROM ONE DOORWAY TO ANOTHER, SHOOT OUT THE TRAPDOOR TO CAUSE HER TO FALL INSIDE (AND THEN SHOOT THE BEAST THAT WAS CHASING HER). YOUR OTHER TARGETS ARE MOSTLY ASSORTED GHOSTS, AND A FEW RANDOM BODY PARTS THAT WILL FALL FROM THE CEILING.
THE FINAL LEVEL IS A GRAVEYARD. YOUR ONLY HUMAN VICTIM ON THIS LEVEL IS A WOMAN WHO IS HALF BURIED IN THE GROUND, SHOOTING HER TORSO MULTIPLE TIMES STRIPS OFF HER CLOTHING UNTIL SHE IS TOPLESS, AND THE LAST SHOT KILLS HER. YOU OTHER TARGETS ARE BATS, HANDS THAT POP UP FROM THE GROUND, AND A MAN WHO PULLS A CART FULL OF BODY PARTS (YOU CAN'T KILL HIM, SHOOTING HIM JUST MAKES HIM RUN AWAY, ONLY TO RETURN LATER).

THE GAME REPEATS THE LEVELS OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL YOU MANAGE TO FIND EVERY SECRET TARGET ON EACH SCREEN (IT GIVES YOU HINTS BETWEEN THE LEVELS). FINDING ALL THE TARGETS ON A SINGLE SCREEN EARNS YOU A BONUS GAME (A SLOT MACHINE), WHILE FINDING ALL THE HIDDEN TARGETS IN THE GAME GIVES YOU THE SECOND BONUS GAME (A SHOOTING GALLERY), AND A FREE GAME.</desc>

		<name>Chimera Beast</name>
		<desc>A HORIZONTALLY SCROLLING SHOOT'EM UP WHERE 1 OR 2 PLAYERS CONTROL CREATURES KNOWN AS 'EATERS' WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF EATING OTHER CREATURES AND TAKING THEIR DNA, THUS ACQUIRING THEIR ABILITIES OR CHARACTERISTICS.

CHIMERA BEAST TAKES PLACE ON A PLANET WHICH IS DESCRIBED AS DISTANT AND EARTH-LIKE. THE PLANET IS OVERRUN BY ANIMALS KNOWN AS EATERS, CAPABLE OF EATING OTHER CREATURES AND ACQUIRING THEIR ABILITIES OR CHARACTERISTICS. THE PLAYER CONTROLS ONE OF THESE EATERS AND PROGRESSES THROUGH THE GAME BY MEANS OF EVOLUTION, CONSUMING MICROSCOPIC ORGANISMS IN THE FIRST STAGE, FISH IN THE SECOND, AND SO ON. WHEN THE PLAYER'S CREATURE GETS BIG ENOUGH TO TAKE ON HUMANITY, THE GOAL OF THE GAME IS REVEALED. THE PLANET'S HUMANS HAVE DEVELOPED SPACE TRAVEL, WHICH THE PLAYER MUST THWART, SO AS NOT TO GIVE THE EATERS A MEANS OF ESCAPING THE PLANET. THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE ENDINGS: ONE IN WHICH THE PLAYER IS ABLE TO STOP THE EATERS FROM ESCAPING THE PLANET, AND ONE IN WHICH THE EATERS DO ESCAPE AND, WE ARE TOLD, WILL EVENTUALLY MAKE THEIR WAY TO EARTH.

THE CHIEF INNOVATION OF CHIMERA BEAST IS ITS POWER-UP SYSTEM. INSTEAD OF COLLECTING GUN UPGRADES AS IN MOST GAMES OF THIS GENRE, THE PLAYER'S EATER ENHANCES ITSELF BY EATING OTHER CREATURES AND ASSUMING THEIR ABILITIES AND DEFENSES. INSTEAD OF SIMPLY HAVING VARIOUS TYPES OF PROJECTILE WEAPONRY, THE GAME ATTEMPTS TO MAKE THESE NEW ABILITIES AS VARIED AS POSSIBLE. CONSUMING A CRUSTACEAN MIGHT GIVE THE PLAYER'S EATER A HARD PROTECTIVE SHELL, FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE AN INSECTOID CREATURE MIGHT OFFER A POISONOUS TAIL INSTEAD. THE GAME EVEN INCLUDES THE ABILITY TO USE CANCER AS A WEAPON.

ANOTHER DIFFERENCE FROM TYPICAL SHOOTER MECHANICS IS THAT THE PLAYER'S EATER DOES NOT DIE AFTER BEING HIT. IT HAS A LIFE BAR, WHICH CAN BE CHARGED BY CONSUMING ENEMIES. IT IS EVEN POSSIBLE TO EAT ENOUGH CHARGE THE LIFE BAR PAST ITS STARTING POSITION, CREATING A LARGER EATER WHICH IS NOT ONLY MORE POWERFUL BUT CAN TAKE MORE DAMAGE AS WELL.</desc>

THERE ARE NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE JAPANESE AND US VERSIONS OF THE ARCADE GAME - THE US VERSION HAS A MLB LICENSE AND USES US TEAMS, WHILE THE JAPANESE VERSION OPTS FOR JAPANESE PLAYERS AND TEAMS. THERE ARE ALSO SUBTLE CHANGES TO THE PRESENTATION TO REFLECT THE TWO REGIONS. A CHICKEN LEG, AN ENEMY SEEN IN ALTERED BEAST AND GOLDEN AXE, MAKES A CAMEO APPEARANCE IN THE RESULTS SCREEN.

CLUTCH HITTER IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN ENTRY IN THE SUPER LEAGUE SERIES OF BASEBALL GAMES, DIRECTLY INSPIRING THE IMPROVEMENTS PRO YAKYUU SUPER LEAGUE '91 MADE TO SUPER LEAGUE.</desc>

THERE IS AN ION SHIELD WHICH PROVIDES TEMPORARY SAFETY FOR THE COLONY BELOW, BUT CAN BE BLASTED AWAY BY ALIEN FIRE.

COLONY 7 IS IN MANY WAYS A COMBINATION OF TWO OF THE MOST POPULAR SHOOT 'EM UP GAMES OF THE TIME, CONTAINING ELEMENTS OF BOTH TEHKAN'S PLEIADS AND ATARI'S MISSILE COMMAND. THE MAIN INNOVATION OF COLONY 7 WAS THE EXTENDED WEAPONRY ARSENAL. THIS GAVE THE PLAYER THE CHOICE TO CHANGE BETWEEN SEVERAL DIFFERENT WEAPONS, WITH THE THE ERADICATOR NEEDING TO BE PURCHASED SEPARATELY AS "EXTENDED WEAPONRY".</desc>

EACH PLAYER'S CHARACTER IS EQUIPPED WITH A SEMI-AUTOMATIC MACHINE GUN WITH AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION AND CAN JUMP, MOVE AND FIRE IN ALL EIGHT CARDINAL DIRECTIONS. PLAYERS CAN ALSO MOVE AND JUMP SIMULTANEOUSLY WHILE FIRING. CO-ORDINATION OF THE CHARACTER'S MOVEMENT IS ESSENTIAL AS A SINGLE HIT FROM ANY ENEMY, BULLET, OR OTHER HAZARD WILL INSTANTLY KILL THE PLAYER'S CHARACTER AND ALSO ELIMINATE THE CURRENT WEAPON FROM THE PLAYER'S INVENTORY.</desc>

HOW TO PLAY:
YOUR AVENGER CAN BE MOVED IN 8 DIRECTIONS. THE SPEED INCREASES AS IT ADVANCES, WHILE IT DECREASES AS IT RETREATS.
DESTROY THE FRONT ENEMY BY PRESSING THE FIRE BUTTON, AND DESTROY THE TARGET BELOW BY PRESSING THE BOMB BUTTON.
THE ENEMY UFO WILL ASSAULT YOU FLYING EITHER FROM IN FRONT OF YOU OR FROM BEHIND YOU.  YOU CAN LOCATE IT BY USING THE RADAR.
A TOUGH CHASE MISSILE WILL PURSUE YOUR AVENGER PERSISTENTLY. DODGE IT SUCCESSFULLY, AND YOU CAN CAUSE THE ENEMY TO FIGHT AMONG THEMSELVES.
WHEN YOU PASS THE ENEMY RADAR SITE, AN ANT-AIRCRAFT GUN WILL FIRE AT YOUR ACCORDING TO THE ALTITUDE OF YOUR AVENGER.
WHEN THE SCREEN ADVANCES FURTHER, THE X STATION WILL APPEAR. WHEN YOU DESTROY IT IN GOOD TIME, YOU CAN DESTROY ALL THE TARGETS APPEARING ON THE SCREEN AT ONCE. YOU ARE THEN AWARDED A HIGH SCORE.
YOUR AVENGER WILL BE DESTROYED WHEN IT IS AFFECTED BY ANY EXPLOSION.
THE 1ST Â 5TH HIGHEST SCORES FOR THE DAY CAN ENTER THEIR NAMES ON THE SCREEN.</desc>

		<desc>STRAP ON YOUR VECTOR SPACESUIT, AND HOP INTO YOUR VECTOR SPACESHIP. IT IS A GOOD OLD SHIP, AND IT HAS SEEN A LOT OF ACTION. FROM NAVIGATING THE ASTEROID BELT AND BLASTING ALIENS AROUND THE SUN, TO ATTACKING EVIL SPACE CANNONS, YOUR LITTLE VECTOR SHIP HAS DONE IT ALL, AND THIS TIME IT HAS BEEN UPGRADED WITH TWIN BLASTERS. YOU SEE THE SHIP IN COSMIC CHASM SEEMS TO BE THE SAME SPACESHIP THAT IS IN EVERY VECTOR GAME. YOU CONTROL IT USING ROTATION BUTTONS AND A THRUSTER BUTTON, WITH A LASER AND A SHIELD BUTTON THROWN IN FOR GOOD MEASURE, JUST LIKE ALMOST EVERY OTHER VECTOR GAME AROUND.

NOW HERE IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. YOU GUIDE YOUR SHIP THROUGH A SPACE FORTRESS ROOM BY ROOM. EACH ROOM CONTAINS A CENTER SECTION THAT SLOWLY GROWS AND WILL EVENTUALLY TRAP YOU IF YOU ARE NOT FAST ENOUGH. YOU CAN SHOOT THE CENTER SECTION TO SLOW ITS GROWTH. EACH ROOM ALSO CONTAINS SEVERAL EXITS. ONE OF THE EXITS WILL ALWAYS SPEW FORTH A BUNCH OF BAD GUYS, SHOOT THEM, THEN EXIT TO GO TO A DIFFERENT ROOM. BETWEEN ROOMS YOU GET TO SEE AN EXCELLENT TUNNEL ANIMATION. THE IDEA IS TO MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE CENTER OF THE FORTRESS, BLAST THE POWER CORE, AND THEN LEAVE. THERE IS A MAP AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN TO KEEP YOU FROM GETTING LOST. THIS IS A PRETTY DECENT GAME. IT HAS A LOT MORE TO OFFER THAN THE ONE SCREEN OF BAD GUYS THAT MOST VECTOR GAMES HAVE.</desc>

		<desc>GALIVAN IS A SINGLE PLAYER PLATFORM SHOOT-EM-UP IN WHICH THE PLAYER TAKES ON THE ROLL OF A 'COSMO POLICE' OFFICER WHO RUNS AND JUMPS AROUND A MULTI-DIRECTIONAL SCROLLING CAVE SYSTEM, DESTROYING OR AVOIDING WAVES OF CONSTANTLY ATTACKING ROBOTS, ALIENS AND ALIEN SHIPS.

THE PLAYER STARTS THE GAME AS AN UNARMED HUMAN, WHOSE ONLY ATTACKING OPTIONS ARE KICKING AND PUNCHING, BUT PICKING UP A POW ITEM ENCASES THE HUMAN IN A ROBOTIC SUIT AND ARMS THE PLAYER WITH A LASER GUN.

COLLECTING THE BLUE POW ITEMS WHILE IN THE SUIT AWARDS THE PLAYER WITH A POWERFUL BEAM WEAPON FOR A LIMITED TIME, WHILE THE RED POW ITEM GIVES THE PLAYER A THREE-SHOT CANNON. POW ITEMS ARE DOTTED THROUGHOUT THE LEVELS AND CAN ALSO BE GAINED BY SHOOTING THE BLUE ROBOT ALIENS.

THE PLAYER'S CHARACTER HAS AN ENERGY BAR THAT DECREASES WHENEVER THE PLAYER IS HIT. SHOULD THIS FALL BELOW THE HALFWAY POINT, THE ROBOT SUIT WILL BE LOST AND THE PLAYER WILL ONCE AGAIN BE AN UNARMED HUMAN.

COLLECTING A POW ITEM WHILE IN HUMAN FORM WILL RESTORE THE PLAYER'S ENERGY. IF A POW IS COLLECTED WHILE WEARING THE SUIT, HOWEVER, THE PLAYER'S ENERGY WILL NOT BE INCREASED BUT THEIR WEAPON WILL RECEIVE A POWER-UP.

THE GAME'S PLATFORMS ARE LITTERED WITH SPRINGBOARDS THAT FIRE THE PLAYER HIGH INTO THE AIR WHEN STEPPED ON. SOME PLATFORMS - OFTEN CONTAINING POW ITEMS - CAN ONLY BE REACHED VIA A SPRINGBOARD.</desc>

GAMEPLAY REQUIRES THE PLAYER TO PROTECT A BAND OF ADVENTURERS (REFERRED TO AS "FRIENDS" BY THE GAME) FROM AFAR BY SHOOTING OBJECTS THAT THREATEN THEM. THE ADVENTURERS ENTER FROM THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE SCREEN UNHARMED. IF THE PLAYER HELPS THEM REACH THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE SCREEN SAFELY, THE ADVENTURERS SURVIVE TO THE NEXT SCENARIO, AND NEW ADVENTURERS ARE OCCASIONALLY GRANTED BETWEEN SCENARIOS. IN ADDITION TO THE OBSTACLES, THE ADVENTURERS ARE VULNERABLE TO THE PLAYER'S SHOTS. THE FIRST TIME THE PLAYER SHOOTS AN ADVENTURER, AN ON-SCREEN MESSAGE IS SHOWN: "DON'T SHOOT YOUR FRIENDS!" THEREAFTER, SHOOTING AN ADVENTURER WILL CAUSE HIM/HER TO EMIT A CRY OF PAIN, AND TO WALK AT A SLOWER PACE THE REST OF THE WAY. A SECOND SHOT WILL KILL THE ADVENTURER.SCENARIOS ARE CHOSEN BY SHOOTING A DESTINATION ON A MAP SCREEN, WHICH INCLUDE: TOWN, DESERT, VOLCANO, CAVE, BRIDGE, JUNGLE, AND CASTLE.

THE SHORT PATH TO REACH THE CASTLE IS BY USING THE FOLLOWING COLOR PATHS -&gt;  GREEN -&gt; BLUE -&gt; BLUE -&gt; RED.

THE GOAL IS TO REACH THE FINAL SCENARIO, PAST THE CASTLE, IN WHICH THE PLAYER CONFRONTS THE MASTERÂWHO PRESUMABLY CREATED THE DANGERS IN THE GAME. DEFEATING THE MASTER OF DARKNESS REQUIRES SHOOTING HIM IN THE EYES WHEN THEY TURN RED (AND DEADLY). THE PLAYER IS TREATED TO A BRIEF CONGRATULATION AND A CHALLENGE TO DEFEAT THE MASTER AGAIN, BUT IF YOU DARE. FOLLOWING THIS SCREEN THE PLAYER STARTS OVER WITH HOWEVER MANY ADVENTURERS SURVIVED THE CONFRONTATION.</desc>

		<name>Crush Roller</name>
		<desc>CRUSH ROLLER IS A MAZE GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYER CONTROLS A PAINTBRUSH AND MUST PAINT THE ENTIRE LAYOUT IN ORDER TO ADVANCE TO THE NEXT STAGE. TWO FISH  ONE YELLOW, THE OTHER LIGHT BLUE  EMERGE FROM SEPARATE AQUARIUMS TO PURSUE THE PAINTBRUSH AROUND THE BOARD, AND IF EITHER OF THE FISH SUCCEEDS IN MAKING CONTACT WITH THE PAINTBRUSH, THE PLAYER LOSES A LIFE.

THE PLAYER MAY USE TWO "ROLLERS" TO ATTACK THE FISH. THE ROLLERS ARE LOCATED ON TWO OVERPASSES, ONE VERTICAL IN ITS ORIENTATION, THE OTHER HORIZONTAL. TO USE A ROLLER, THE PLAYER POSITIONS THE PAINTBRUSH ON THE FORWARD END OF THE ROLLER, WAITS FOR EITHER OR BOTH OF THE FISH TO APPROACH, THEN PUSHES THE PAINTBRUSH ALONG THE ROLLER, ATTACKING THE FISH. THE FISH IS REMOVED FROM THE MAZE FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN RETURNS TO ONE OF THE AQUARIUMS AND RESUMES ITS PURSUIT OF THE PAINTBRUSH. KILLING FISH IN THIS MANNER SCORES BONUS POINTS.

A THIRD CHARACTER, APPEARING TO BE AN ANIMAL OR HUMAN FIGURE DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL, MAY ENTER THE MAZE AND LEAVE TRACKS THAT MUST BE PAINTED OVER IN ORDER FOR THE BOARD TO BE COMPLETED. THE PLAYER CAN LIMIT THE DAMAGE BY RUNNING OVER THE FIGURE, WHICH NOT ONLY STOPS FURTHER TRACKS FROM BEING LEFT BUT ALSO AWARDS THE PLAYER A SCORE, WHICH PROGRESSIVELY INCREASES AS MORE BOARDS ARE CLEARED.</desc>

		<name>Crystal Castles</name>
		<desc>CRYSTAL CASTLES IS AN INVENTIVE VARIATION ON THE MAZE-DRIVEN COLLECT-THE-DOTS GAMEPLAY FIRST SEEN IN NAMCO'S LEGENDARY "PAC-MAN". THE PLAYER TAKES ON THE ROLE OF 'BENTLEY BEAR', WHO MUST RUN AROUND A NUMBER OF "CASTLES" - EACH PRESENTED IN THE FORM OF AN ISOMETRIC FORCED 3D MAZE - PICKING UP THE GEMSTONES THAT LITTER ITS WALKWAYS AND PLATFORMS, BEFORE MOVING ONTO THE NEXT CASTLE. 

EACH LEVEL IS POPULATED BY A VARIETY OF ENEMIES, INCLUDING SENTIENT TREES, GEM EATERS, A SWARM OF BEES AND BERTHILDA THE WITCH. SOME ENEMY TYPES MOVE AROUND THE LEVELS RANDOMLY, WHILE OTHERS WILL ACTIVELY CHASE BENTLEY. GEM EATERS WILL DEVOUR ANY GEMS THEY REACH BEFORE THE PLAYER. 

IN ADDITION TO FOUR-DIRECTIONAL WALKING, BENTLEY CAN ALSO JUMP TO AVOID PURSUING ENEMIES AND OBSTACLES. MANY LEVELS HAVE PLATFORMS THAT CAN ONLY BE REACHED VIA AN ELEVATOR AND SOME SCREENS ALSO CONTAIN HIDDEN SECRET PASSAGES AND RAMPS, AS WELL AS 'WARPS' THAT MOVE PLAYERS FORWARD SEVERAL LEVELS. 

JUMPING OVER THE TREES WILL SHRINK AND TEMPORARILY DISABLE THEM, WHILE WEARING BERTHILDA'S RED HAT GRANTS THE PLAYER TEMPORARY INVINCIBILITY, ALLOWING THEM TO KILL THE WITCH SHOULD THEY MANAGE TO CATCH HER. IF BENTLEY BEAR TOUCHES A GEM EATER WHILE IT'S IN THE PROCESS OF EATING A GEM, THE GEM EATER DIES AND 500 POINTS ARE AWARDED TO THE PLAYER. HOWEVER, IF THE GEM EATER IS NOT EATING A GEM WHEN TOUCHED, BENTLEY BEAR DIES. 

SOME LEVELS CONTAIN A LARGE POT OF HONEY. A SWARM OF BEES APPEARS NEAR THE HONEY APPROXIMATELY EVERY FIVE SECONDS BUT COLLECTING THE HONEY POT EARNS THE PLAYER 1,000 BONUS POINTS AND CAUSES THE BEES TO APPEAR LESS FREQUENTLY. OTHER ENEMIES, SUCH AS THE BALLS, SKELETONS AND GHOSTS MUST BE AVOIDED. 

IF BENTLEY COLLECTS ALL OF THE GEMS ON A CASTLE, THE PLAYER RECEIVES BONUS POINTS. A BONUS IS ALSO AWARDED IN THE EVENT OF THE PLAYER PICKING UP THE LAST GEM ON THE LEVEL. 

CRYSTAL CASTLES CONSISTS OF TEN DIFFERENT STAGES BROKEN DOWN INTO 37 CASTLE MAZES (WITH FOUR CASTLES MAKING UP EACH STAGE, APART FROM 10TH, WHICH HAS ONLY ONE CASTLE).</desc>

THEIR MISSION IS TO QUELL AN ALIEN INVASION WHICH IS SPANNING ALL OF THE MILKY WAY AND DESTROY THE ALIEN HEADQUARTERS: THE DANGER-SEED.

THE PLAYER STARTS THE GAME WITH THREE SEPARATE FIGHTERS AND HAS TO MAKE IT THROUGH FOUR TUBES USING THE FIGHTERS SEPARATELY. IF ONE GETS DESTROYED, THEN THE NEXT, MORE POWERFUL SHIP MAKES AN ATTEMPT TO GET THROUGH. IF THE PLAYER MAKES IT TO THE FIFTH STAGE, THE THREE SHIPS COMBINE INTO A SINGULAR COMPOSITE SHIP CALLED THE "MOON DIVER", WHICH HAS A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF FIREPOWER.</desc>

		<name>Darwin 4078</name>
		<desc>THE GAME TAKES PLACE WITHIN A GIGANTIC SPACESHIP WHICH HAS VIRTUALLY INFINITE CAPACITY BECAUSE OF ITS ABILITY TO MANIPULATE TIME AND SPACE. THE PLAYER MUST DEAL WITH ENIGMATIC CREATURES CALLED EVOL, WHICH CONSIST ONLY OF PURE ENERGY AND NEED TO KEEP THEMSELVES IN CAPSULES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEIR EXISTENCE IN THE WORLD.

ALL OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE GAME ARE DESIGNED TO RESEMBLE MICROSCOPIC ORGANISMS, BOTH IN THEIR APPEARANCE AND THEIR QUICK, TRICKY MOVEMENTS. THE PLAYER'S SHIP UNDERGOES OVER 10 TYPES OF TRANSFORMATIONS THROUGHOUT THE GAME, EACH WITH OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE MANEUVERS SPECIFIC TO THEIR DESIGN. THE SOUND EFFECTS USED ARE MINIMAL, BUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOUNDS ARE USED ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF SHOTS OR THEIR SPEED. A SOUND RESEMBLING A LONG SCREAM RESULTS WHEN THE PLAYER'S SHIP IS HIT AND RETURNS TO ITS WEAKEST EVOLUTIONARY STATE.

THE PLAYER MUST PROGRESS THROUGH 16 DIFFERENT LEVELS, DEFEATING THE BOSS AT THE END OF EACH LEVEL. THE PLAYER CONTROLS THEIR SHIP USING AN 8-WAY JOYSTICK AND 2 BUTTONS (ONE BUTTON TARGETS ENEMIES IN THE AIR, AND THE OTHER TARGETS THE ENEMIES ON THE GROUND). THE POWER OF THE PLAYER'S SHIP INCREASES AS IT EVOLVES.

THERE ARE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES THAT DEFINE HOW ENEMIES ATTACK. THE FIRST TYPE ONLY SHOOTS IN THE FORWARD DIRECTION AT A CONSTANT SPEED, BUT THE SECOND TYPE SHOOTS BULLETS THAT TRAVEL AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS DEPENDING ON ITS DISTANCE WITH THE PLAYER'S SHIP (THE BULLETS TRAVEL QUICKER IF THE PLAYER IS FARTHER AWAY, AND SLOWER IF THE PLAYER IS CLOSE BY). THIS MAKES IT SO THAT STAYING AWAY FROM ENEMIES WILL NOT NECESSARILY MAKE IT EASIER TO AVOID ATTACKS. THE GAME'S DIFFICULTY ALSO DOES NOT CHANGE OVER TIME, AND ENEMIES DO NOT BECOME STRONGER AS THE PLAYER'S SHIP EVOLVES.</desc>

		<desc>DEFENDER IS A LEGENDARY SIDEWAYS-SCROLLING SHOOT-EM-UP - THE VERY FIRST OF ITS GENRE - IN WHICH THE AIM IS TO PILOT A LASER-FIRING SPACESHIP AND PROTECT HUMANOIDS STRANDED ON THE PLANET'S SURFACE FROM SWARMS OF ALIEN ABDUCTORS.

A LONG-RANGE SCANNER AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN SHOWS THE POSITIONS OF BOTH THE HUMANOIDS AND THE ATTACKING ALIENS. THE IDEAL STRATEGY IS TO SHOOT DOWN THE ALIEN SHIPS BEFORE THEY REACH THE HUMANOIDS. IF A HUMANOID IS CAPTURED, THE ALIEN ABDUCTOR CAN STILL BE DESTROYED, BUT THE PLAYER MUST THEN CATCH THE FALLING HUMANOID AND RETURN IT TO THE SAFETY OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE BEFORE IT FALLS TO ITS DEATH.

IF AN ALIEN IS ALLOWED TO CARRY ITS VICTIM TO THE VERY TOP OF THE SCREEN, THE HUMANOID WILL MUTATE, BECOMING A PERMANENT PART OF THE ALIEN THAT CAPTURED IT. THIS NEW AND DEADLY MUTATION WILL THEN IMMEDIATELY JOIN IN THE ALIEN ATTACK.

THE CHALLENGE BECOMES MORE INTENSE AS ACTION PROGRESSES. FIGHTER SHIPS AND THEIR MINES WILL SOON JOIN THE ABDUCTORS. THERE ARE ALSO MOTHER SHIPS THAT MUST BE DESTROYED; THESE ARE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT AS A DIRECT HIT SMASHES THE MOTHER SHIP INTO A SWARMING MASS OF MINI-SHIPS THAT MUST ALSO BE WIPED OUT. THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE MISSION, THE PLAYER MUST ACT QUICKLY OR FACE POSSIBLE DESTRUCTION BY THE COSMIC BAITER, A FAST AND DANGEROUS ENEMY.

PLAYERS HAVE TWO ESCAPE OPTIONS TO USE AS A LAST RESORT. THE FIRST IS THE 'SMART BOMB', WHICH DESTROYS ALL ON-SCREEN ENEMIES. THE SECOND OPTION IS 'HYPERSPACE', WHICH RANDOMLY TELEPORTS THE PLAYER'S SHIP TO ANOTHER PART OF THE LEVEL. THIS IS HIGHLY RISKY AS IT MAY PLACE THE PLAYER'S SHIP IN A POSITION MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE ONE IT LEFT.

IF ALL HUMANOIDS ARE SUCCESSFULLY ABDUCTED, THE PLANET WILL EXPLODE IN A BLINDING FLASH AND THE WAVES REMAINING UNTIL THE NEXT PLANET IS REACHED TAKE PLACE IN OUTER SPACE, AND CONSIST SOLELY OF DESTROYING ENEMY WAVES.</desc>

		<desc>AN ARCADE PUZZLE GAME IN WHICH A SINGLE PLAYER MUST TUNNEL THEIR WAY THROUGH A NUMBER OF UNDERGROUND CAVES, COLLECTING THE MANY GEMS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE LEVELS. EACH CAVE IS LITTERED WITH ROCKS WHICH, SHOULD THEY FALL ONTO THE PLAYER, WILL RESULT IN A LOSS OF LIFE. CAREFULLY PLANNED TUNNELS CAN BE DUG TO MANIPULATE THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE ROCKS FALL, HOWEVER, WHICH MAKES THEM AN EFFECTIVE WEAPON AGAINST THE MANY ENEMIES THAT POPULATE THE LEVELS. A NUMBER OF RED EXPLOSIVES CAN BE FOUND WHICH CAN ALSO BE USED TO KILL ENEMIES AND ALSO TO DESTROY ANY WALLS BLOCKING THE PLAYER'S PATH. AGAIN, LIKE THE ROCKS, THESE MUST BE USED CAREFULLY TO PREVENT THE EXPLOSION FROM KILLING THE PLAYER.

IN ORDER TO COMPLETE A LEVEL, A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF GEMS MUST BE COLLECTED. ONCE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF GEMS HAVE BEEN COLLECTED, AN EXIT WILL OPEN WHICH THE PLAYER MUST ENTER TO PROCEED TO THE NEXT CAVE.

DIAMOND RUN IS HEAVILY BASED ON FIRST STAR'S COMMODORE C64 CLASSIC, 'BOULDER DASH'.</desc>

THE ACTION NOW TAKES PLACE ON A SERIES OF SMALL ISLANDS, THE GAMEPLAY ITSELF RETAINS MUCH FROM ITS PREDECESSOR, WITH DIG DUG STILL BEING CHASED BY THE 'POOKAS' (ROUND, GOGGLE-WEARING RED ENEMIES) AND THE 'FYGERS' (GREEN, FIRE-BREATHING DRAGONS).

AS WITH THE FIRST GAME, DIG DUG IS STILL ARMED WITH A PUMP THAT ALLOWS HIM TO INFLATE AND BURST THE ENEMIES. FOR THE SEQUEL, HOWEVER, HE IS ALSO ARMED WITH A JACKHAMMER. THIS CAN BE USED AT THE ROUND GROUND-PEGS SCATTERED AROUND EACH ISLAND TO CREATE AND CONNECT UP FAULT LINES IN THE GROUND. IF BOTH ENDS OF A SYSTEM OF FAULTS REACHES THE WATER, THE GROUND SURROUNDED BY THEM WILL SINK INTO THE OCEAN KILLING ALL CREATURES ON IT, INCLUDING DIG DUG HIMSELF IF HE IS STANDING ON THE DESTROYED SECTION OF LAND.</desc>

		<desc>DIGGER IS A GAME THAT REQUIRES YOU TO DIG STRATEGICALLY PLACED HOLES WITHIN A MAZE FORMAT SO YOU CAN CAPTURE AND FILL IN OVER THE INVADING CREATURES BEFORE THEY CAN ATTACK AND DESTROY YOUR MAN. THE MAZE FORMAT CHANGES WITH EVERY ROUND PLAYED.

THE CREATURES ARE CONFINED BEHIND A WALL. IN THE FIRST OF THREE ROUNDS OF GAME PLAY, FOUR CREATURES ARE LET OUT OF THE HOLDING AREA THROUGH A GATE. YOU MUST CONQUER THESE FOUR BEFORE ADVANCING TO THE NEXT ROUND, WHERE YOU FACE SIX CREATURES. YOUR THIRD ROUND HAS YOU BATTLING EIGHT CREATURES. THIS PROCESS IS REPEATED AND THE POINT VALUE INCREASED WITH EACH THREE-ROUND VICTORY. ALSO, CREATURES' SPEED INCREASES EACH ROUND. ANY CONTACT AT ALL WITH THE CREATURES WILL BE FATAL TO YOUR MAN.

WHILE YOU ARE BUSY DIGGING HOLES AND ENTRAPPING CREATURES, THE REST ARE BEHIND THE RETAINING WALL SCURRYING BACK AND FORTH. AFTER ABOUT THREE MINUTES, THE GATES AT EACH END WILL OPEN AND ALL OF THE REMAINING CREATURES WILL STREAM INTO THE PLAY AREA AT ONCE. HOWEVER, A SKILLFUL PLAYER WILL CONQUER ALL OF THE CREATURES OF EACH ROUND AND THE GATE WILL NOT BE A THREAT.</desc>

		<desc>A SUPERB FINAL ENTRY INTO THE "MR DO!" SERIES (NOT COUNTING THE NEO GEO-BASED "NEO MR. DO", WHICH WAS MERELY A REMAKE OF THE FIRST GAME IN THE SERIES), "DO! RUN RUN" TAKES ITS INSPIRATION FROM NAMCO'S "PAC-MAN".

AS IN HIS PREVIOUS GAMES, MR DO! MUST ONCE AGAIN COLLECT COLOURED DOTS AND/OR FRUIT WHILE AVOIDING OR KILLING A NUMBER OF ENEMIES. FOR THE FOURTH MR DO! OUTING, UNIVERSAL DITCHED THE SIDEWAYS VIEWPOINT OF THE SERIES' PREVIOUS GAMES AND SWITCHED TO AN OVERHEAD PERSPECTIVE. THIS ALLOWED THE GAME TO GIVE AN IMPRESSION OF 'DEPTH', WITH SLOPES AND STEPS AFFECTING MR DO!'S MOBILITY AND SPEED.

MR. DO. HAS TWO ITEMS AT HIS DISPOSAL WITH WHICH HE CAN KILL THE HIS ENEMIES. THE FIRST IS THE 'POWERBALL', WHICH FEATURED IN THE ORIGINAL 'MR. DO!' BUT WAS DROPPED FROM THE FIRST TWO SEQUELS. THE POWERBALL CAN BE SHOT DIRECTLY AT AN ENEMY TO KILL IT INSTANTLY.

THE SECOND OFFENSIVE OPTION IS PROVIDED IN THE FORM OF THE LARGE WOODEN LOGS THAT LITTER THE LEVELS. THESE WORK IN THE SAME WAY AS THE APPLES DID IN THE ORIGINAL GAME, AND CAN BE PUSHED FREE OF THEIR SUPPORTING STRUTS, CAUSING THEM TO ROLL DOWN THE SCREEN AND KILL EVERYTHING IN THEIR PATH, INCLUDING MR. DO. HIMSELF IF HE STRAYS TOO NEAR.

AS MR DO! MOVES AROUND A SCREEN, HE TRAILS A LINE BEHIND HIM. PLAYERS CAN JOIN THE TWO ENDS OF THE LINE UP TO FORM A RECTANGLE (IN A SIMILAR FASHION TO TAITO'S 1981 CLASSIC, "QIX") WHICH WILL CHANGE ANY DOTS WITHIN THE RECTANGLE INTO CHERRIES. A SECOND RECTANGLE CAN BE DRAWN AROUND THE CHERRIES WHICH IN TURN WILL CHANGE THEM INTO APPLES. THIS CAN BE REPEATED TWICE MORE, CHANGING APPLES INTO LEMONS, AND LEMONS INTO PINEAPPLES. THE BETTER THE FRUIT, THE MORE BONUS POINTS MR DO! WILL EARN WHEN HE COLLECTS THEM.</desc>

		<desc>A VERY FUNNY SHOOT'EM UP GAME.

HOP TO NEW PLANE: IF YOUR PLANE BECOMES DAMAGED, YOU DON'T NEED TO WASTE A PARACHUTE TO REACH THE GROUND FOR A REPLACEMENT. YOU CAN JUMP TO A NEW PLANE BY SIMPLY FLYING VERY CLOSE, USUALLY RIGHT UNDER OR ON TOP OF YOUR PLANE AND PRESSING THE JUMP BUTTON. IF THE OTHER PLANE IS IN JUST THE RIGHT SPOT, YOU'LL MAKE IT, BUT OTHERWISE YOU'LL FALL.

DESTROY UFOS THE EASY WAY: WHEN YOU REACH THE UFO WAVE OF THE BATTLE YOU'RE IN, TAKE YOUR PLANE DOWN AS CLOSE TO THE GROUND AS YOU CAN WITHOUT CRASHING. CHANCES ARE, THANKS TO THE CIRCULAR PATTERN OF THEIR FLIGHT, THE UFOS WILL ARC OVER YOU AND SMASH THEMSELVES INTO THE GROUND.

SCORE BIG POINTS: WHILE ON THE GROUND, INSTEAD OF CLIMBING RIGHT ONTO YOUR REPLACEMENT PLANE, JUMP OVER IT. FOR EACH TIME YOU DO THIS, YOU'LL SCORE 1,000 POINTS. AS LONG AS YOU'RE CAREFUL, YOU CAN GET A LOT OF POINTS THIS WAY.
ENEMY RAN AWAY!!: AFTER DESTROYING 20 AIRCRAFT IN A WAVE, THE ENEMY RETREATS AND YOU ARE AWARDED WITH 20,000 POINTS AND A FREE PARACHUTE!</desc>

THE PENGUIN CAN PUSH THE EGG LEFT OR RIGHT AND CAN JUMP ON IT TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T GET STUCK AGAINST A WALL. DIGGING AFFECTS THE TILE ONE BLOCK AWAY FROM THE PENGUIN'S POSITION, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DIG DIRECTLY DOWNWARDS. IF THE EGG GETS INTO A POSITION WHERE IT CANNOT BE MOVED LEFT OR RIGHT, JUMPING AND LANDING ON IT WILL CAUSE IT TO SMASH.</desc>

		<desc>THE PLAYER CONTROLS DOMINO MAN, A BESPECTACLED, MOUSTACHIOED ARTIST WHO MUST SET UP A CHAIN OF GIANT DOMINOES ACROSS THE SCREEN, TO FORM A CHAIN OF DOMINOES WHICH CAN THEN BE TOPPLED.

THE DOMINOES MUST BE PLACED ON SITES MARKED BY BLACK SPOTS, ACHIEVED BY SIMPLY RUNNING OVER EACH SPOT. ONCE ALL OF THE SPOTS ARE COVERED WITH A DOMINO, THE CHAIN IS COMPLETE. THE PLAYER WILL THEN HAVE THE CHOICE OF EITHER KNOCKING THEM ALL DOWN TO CLEAR THE LEVEL, OR SIMPLY WAIT FOR A FEW SECONDS TO CONTINUE TO THE NEXT SCREEN, IN HOPE OF COMPLETING THE CHAIN ON THAT LEVEL, AND SO ON. IN THIS WAY, THE PLAYER CAN SET UP SEVERAL CHAINS AND KNOCK THEM ALL DOWN IN ONE FELL SWOOP, EARNING MANY BONUS POINTS IN THE PROCESS. MULTIPLE CHAINS ARE, OF COURSE, VERY DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE.

DOMINO MAN'S PROGRESS IS HAMPERED BY A NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY WHO WALKS ONTO THE SCREEN AND TRIES TO KNOCK OVER THE FIRST DOMINOES HE COMES ACROSS. THE PLAYER MUST EITHER TRY TO COMPLETE AND TOPPLE THE CHAIN OF DOMINOES BEFORE THE BULLY KNOCKS THEM OVER, OR HIT THE BULLY WITH A DOMINO; CAUSING THE BULLY'S TROUSERS TO FALL DOWN AND DISABLING HIM FOR A FEW SECONDS. A KILLER BEE ALSO APPEARS, AND IF IT MANAGES TO STING THE PLAYER, A LIFE IS LOST. A BAG LADY AND A BOY PUSHING A SHOPPING CART WANDER BLINDLY AROUND THE LEVELS, OCCASIONALLY KNOCKING OVER SOME OF THE DOMINOES. DOMINO MAN CAN HIT THEM, HOWEVER, CAUSING THEM TO CHANGE DIRECTION.

ONCE A GAME IS OVER, A POEM IS DISPLAYED ON-SCREEN TO EVALUATE THE PLAYER'S PERFORMANCE ON THE GAME. FOR EXAMPLE:
ROSES ARE RED
OR SO GOES THE VERSE
YOU SET UP FIFTY-TWO
YOU COULD HAVE DONE WORSE.</desc>

TYPE A: A RED (OR YELLOW/ORANGE, FOR PLAYER TWO) FIGHTER, WHICH FIRES A NARROW STREAM OF SHOTS

SINCE THE LEE BROTHERS ARE LOOKING FOR A TRUE CHALLENGE TO PUT THEIR MARTIAL ARTS SKILLS TO THE ULTIMATE TEST, THEY AGREE TO FACE THIS MYSTERIOUS NEW ENEMY. THEY EMBARK ON A WORLD QUEST - JOINING UP WITH NEW ALLIES IN THE PROCESS - AND TRY TO LAY CLAIM TO THE FAMOUS 'ROSETTA STONE'.

		<desc>FOLLOWING HIS DEFEAT AT THE END OF THE ORIGINAL DOUBLE DRAGON, WILLY, THE LEADER OF THE BLACK WARRIORS, RETALIATES AGAINST BILLY AND JIMMY LEE BY MURDERING THEIR FRIEND, MARIAN, LEAVING THE BROTHERS WITH THE TASK TO AVENGE HER DEATH.

THE SEQUEL TO DOUBLE DRAGON IS ESSENTIALLY AN UPGRADED VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL GAME, BUT WITH WITH A TWO-WAY ATTACKING SYSTEM SIMILAR TO ONE PREVIOUSLY USED IN TECHNOS JAPAN'S 1986 ARCADE GAME "RENEGADE". MANY OF THE ATTACKS AND COMBOS FROM THE ORIGINAL "DOUBLE DRAGON" ARE RETAINED, AS WELL AS NEW TECHNIQUES INCLUDING THE INVINCIBLE CYCLONE KICK.

THE STAGES AND WEAPONS ARE REDESIGNED VERSIONS OF ITEMS PREVIOUSLY FEATURED IN THE ORIGINAL GAME. THERE ARE A FEW NEW TRAPS SUCH AS A BULLDOZER IN THE MIDDLE OF MISSION 3 AND ALL OF THE TRANSITION SEQUENCES BETWEEN STAGES ARE NOW DONE WITH THE CHARACTER ENTERING THE NEXT LEVEL VIA A LIFT, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY ONE WEAPON TO THE NEXT AREA.

MOST OF THE ENEMY CHARACTERS RETURN FROM THE ORIGINAL DOUBLE DRAGON, WITH SOME GIVEN FACELIFTS, BUT THE STAGE BOSSES ARE ALL NEW. THE ENEMIES ARE AS FOLLOWED:
WILLIAMS - HAS A WILDER FACE AND LONGER HAIR. HE CAN NOW RUN TOWARDS THE PLAYER AND DO CARTWHEELS. HE THROWS HIS KNIVES IN MID-AIR AND SOMETIMES CARRY A SHOVEL WHICH HE THROWS TOWARDS THE PLAYER.
ROWPER - HAS A BEARD AND EYE-PATCH, BUT OTHERWISE IS MORE OR LESS IDENTICAL TO HIS ORIGINAL SELF. HE CARRIES SHOVELS AND CAN SOMETIME PICK UP LARGE OBJECTS.
LINDA - SHE NOW HAS A MOHAWK AND FACE PAINT. SHE CAN ALSO JUMP OFF PLATFORMS AND DO THE ELBOW STRIKE AGAINST THE PLAYER. IN ADDITION TO THE BALL AND CHAIN, SHE ALSO CARRIES GRENADES AND KNIVES.
OHARRA - A STRONGMAN WITH A CLEAN-SHAVED FACE. REPLACES ABOBO FROM THE FIRST GAME AND HAS THE SAME ATTACKS.
BOLO - A HEAD-SWAP OF OHARRA WITH LONG HAIR AND BEARD. REPLACES THE MOHAWKED HEAD-SWAP OF ABOBO FROM THE FIRST GAME.
JEFF - SAME AS HIS ORIGINAL SELF, BUT NOW CARRIES GRENADES.
BURNOV - THE BOSS OF MISSION 1. AN OBESE WRESTLER WHOSE FACE IS CONCEALED WITH A MASK. HE GRABS THE PLAYER AND THROWS SIMILAR PUNCHES IN THE FACE. AFTER DYING, HE WILL STAND UP AND YELL, DISAPPEARING IN FRONT OF THE PLAYER AND LEAVING ONLY HIS CLOTHES. IN LATER ENCOUNTERS, HE WILL REVIVE HIMSELF AT LEAST ONCE.
ABORE - THE BOSS OF MISSION 2. A HUGE SUSPENDER-WEARING STRONGMAN WITH TERMINATOR-LIKE SUNGLASSES. HIS SLAPS AND SHOULDER TACKLES DO MASSIVE DAMAGE TO THE PLAYER.
CHIN TAIMEI - THE BOSS OF MISSION 3. A CHINESE MARTIAL ARTISTS ARMED WITH TWIN KALI STICKS. IN ADDITION TO HIS ENERGY-DRAINING STICK COMBO, HE ALSO HAS A JUMP KICK AND SWEEP KICK.
WILLY - THE BOSS OF MISSION 4. LOOKS LIKE HE DOES IN THE ORIGINAL GAME, BUT NOW DRESSES IN RED. HE STILL USES THE SAME MACHINE GUN FROM THE FIRST GAME.
THE CLONE - AFTER DEFEATING WILLY, THE PLAYER WILL HAVE TO FIGHT THEIR CHARACTER'S EVIL SELF. THIS CLONE HAS ALL THE TECHNIQUES THE PLAYER HAS, BUT CAN ALSO THROW ENERGY BEAMS AND POSSESS THE PLAYER'S BODY TO DRAIN HIS ENERGY.</desc>

		<desc>DOUBLE DRAGON IS A SIDE-SCROLLING BEAT-EM-UP FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS, FEATURING TWIN BROTHERS AND MARTIAL ARTS MASTERS, "BILLY &amp; JIMMY LEE". THE BROTHERS MUST DEFEAT THE SAVAGE STREET GANG KNOWN AS THE 'BLACK WARRIORS' TO RESCUE BILLY'S KIDNAPPED GIRLFRIEND, MARIAN. STANDING BETWEEN THE BROTHERS AND MARIAN ARE FOUR HUGE, COLORFUL AND VARIED LEVELS; EACH POPULATED WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF THUGS.

MANY OF THE GAME'S ENEMIES CARRY WEAPONS (KNIVES, BASEBALL BATS ETC.) AND SHOULD BILLY OR JIMMY MANAGE TO KNOCK THE WEAPONS FROM THE ENEMIES' HANDS, THE HEROES CAN PICK THE WEAPONS UP AND USE THEM AGAINST THE ENEMIES.

THE BLACK WARRIORS IS MADE UP OF SIX DISTINCT ENEMY CHARACTERS- PLUS WILLY, THE GAME'S FINAL BOSS - WITH EACH DIFFERING IN BOTH PHYSICAL APPEARANCE AND FIGHTING STYLE. THE MEMBERS OF THE BLACK WARRIORS CONSIST OF THE FOLLOWING FIGHTERS: 
WILLIAMS - A STREET PUNK IN A TANK TOP. IN ADDITION TO THE STANDARD PUNCHES AND JUMP KICKS, HIS SIGNATURE TECHNIQUE IS A BODY BLOW TO THE STOMACH. HE ALSO WIELDS WEAPONS SUCH AS BASEBALL BATS, KNIVES AND DYNAMITE STICKS.
ROWPER - A PUNK WHO WEARS MATCHING-COLORED PANTS AND SHIRTLESS VEST. HE WIELDS ALL THE SAME WEAPONS AS WILLIAMS, BUT CAN ALSO LIFT AND THROW HEAVY OBJECTS SUCH AS OILDRUMS, BOXES AND STONES.
LINDA - FEMALE PUNK WHO USUALLY CARRIES A WHIP. SHE'S NOT VERY STRONG, AS SHE FALLS DOWN TO GROUND WITH A COUPLE OF PUNCHES OR A SINGLE KICK (BECAUSE OF THIS, SHE IS THE ONLY REGULAR-SIZED ENEMY WHO CANNOT BE PLACED ON A HEADLOCK).
ABOBO - A TALL, BIG-MUSCLED BALD GUY. HIS ATTACKS INCLUDES PUNCHES, A STANDING KICK AND A BODY TOSS. HE CAN ALSO LIFT AND THROW HEAVY OBJECTS LIKE ROWPER. DUE TO HIS LARGE SIZE, HE CANNOT BE PUT INTO A HEADLOCK.
BOSS 1 - THE FIRST BOSS, A HEAD-SWAP OF ABOBO WITH A MR. T-STYLE MOHAWK AND BEARD. FIGHTS JUST LIKE ABOBO, ONLY WITH AN ADDED DOUBLE-HANDED SLAP. UNLIKE ABOBO, HE DOES NOT USE WEAPONS. A GREEN VERSION OF HIM APPEARS AS THE MISSION 3 BOSS.
BOSS 2 - THE SECOND BOSS. A HEAD SWAP OF THE PLAYER WHO USES ALMOST ALL THE SAME TECHNIQUES. 
WILLY - THE GAME'S FINAL BOSS, ARMED, SOMEWHAT UNFAIRLY, WITH A MACHINE-GUN.

DOUBLE DRAGON WAS A HUGE SUCCESS DUE TO THE MANY GAME-PLAY INNOVATIONS IT BROUGHT TO THE GENRE (SEE TRIVIA FOR DETAILS), BUT IT DEMONSTRATES ITS FINAL MOMENT OF INSPIRED GENIUS AT THE VERY END OF THE GAME. SHOULD BOTH PLAYERS STILL BE ALIVE AFTER THE FINAL BOSS HAS BEEN DEFEATED, THEY WILL THEN HAVE TO FIGHT EACH OTHER. THE WINNER OF THIS FIGHT WILL BE THE ONE WHO WINS MARIAN'S AFFECTIONS.</desc>

		<desc>AN EARLY PLATFORM GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYER MUST DEFEAT A MAD SCIENTIST, AVOIDING AND DESTROYING HIS EVIL CREATIONS IN THE PROCESS.

THE GAME CONSISTS OF 3 SINGLE-SCREEN LEVELS:

ON THE FIRST THE PLAYER MUST MOVE FROM THE LEFT TO THE RIGHT OF THE SCREEN, DROPPING DOWN ONTO CONSTANTLY MOVING METAL PILLARS AND SHOOTING THE ENEMIES.

ON THE SECOND LEVEL, THE PLAYER MUST STEER A FLOATING BALL AROUND THE SCREEN, KILLING AS MANY ENEMIES AS POSSIBLE. ONCE ENOUGH ENEMIES HAVE BEEN KILLED, AN EXIT WILL OPEN WHICH THE PLAYER MUST ENTER. THE FLOATING BALL GRADUALLY DIMINISHES AND THE PLAYER WILL HAVE TO DROP TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN SEVERAL TIMES TO GET A REPLACEMENT BALL.

THE FINAL SCREEN TAKES PLACE ON THE SCIENTIST'S PRODUCTION LINE; WITH MACHINERY THAT MUST BE CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED. TWO LARGE ROBOTS BAR THE ROUTE TO THE SCIENTIST AND MUST BE DESTROYED BEFORE THE SCIENTIST CAN BE REACHED.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Breed</name>
		<desc>DRAGON BREED IS A SIDE-SCROLLING SHOOT-EM-UP IN WHICH THE PLAYER CONTROLS THE GAME'S HERO, KAYUS, WHO IS RIDING ON THE BACK OF A FULLY ARTICULATED DRAGON NAMED 'BAHAMOOT'. THE DRAGON IS IMMUNE TO ENEMY ATTACKS, CAPABLE OF BLOCKING MOST PROJECTILES AND OF DAMAGING AND EVENTUALLY KILLING ENEMIES ON CONTACT. DRAGON RIDER KAYUS IS ARMED WITH A FORWARD-FIRING CROSSBOW BUT UNLIKE HIS STEED, IS NOT INVULNERABLE AND WILL BE KILLED BY CONTACT WITH EITHER ENEMIES OR THEIR PROJECTILES. 

WHAT SEPARATES DRAGON BREED FROM OTHER GAMES IN THE GENRE IS IN HOW THE DRAGON CAN BE UTILISED. BAHAMOOT'S BODY IS FLEXIBLE AND RESPONDS TO KAYUS' MOVEMENT, ENABLING KAYUS TO USE BAHAMOOT AS BOTH A MOBILE SHIELD AND A WHIP-LIKE WEAPON. IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO ENCIRCLE THE TAIL AROUND A GROUP OF ENEMIES TO KILL THEM. THE TAIL OF THE YELLOW OR BLUE DRAGON CAN BE COILED AROUND THE DRAGON'S RIDER TO OFFER ALMOST COMPLETE INVULNERABILITY FOR A LIMITED TIME.

BAHAMOOT CAN ALSO SPIT FIREBALLS. BY HOLDING THE FIRE BUTTON DOWN, THE DRAGON WILL BUILD UP FIRE IN ITS MOUTH; THE LONGER THE BUTTON IS HELD DOWN, THE MORE POWERFUL THE FIREBALL WILL BE. THERE ARE FOUR LEVELS OF FIREBALL POWER AND AT ITS STRONGEST, THE FIREBALL RESEMBLES A DRAGON'S HEAD.

POWER-UPS APPEAR IN THE FORM OF ORBS, ACQUIRED BY SHOOTING SMALL GREEN DRAGONS THAT APPEAR INTERMITTENTLY THROUGHOUT STAGES. THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF ORBS, EACH OF WILL CHANGE BAHAMOOT TO A DIFFERENT COLOUR AND GRANT HIM A NEW ATTACK POWER: 
RED ORB ENABLES THE DRAGON TO BREATHE A FLAME. 
GOLD ORB ENABLES BAHAMOOT'S BODY TO FIRE CRESCENTS IN ALL DIRECTIONS. 
SILVER ORB ENABLES THE DRAGON TO PRODUCE UP TO FOUR MINIATURE DRAGONS, WHICH HOME IN ON ENEMIES. 
BLUE ORB ENABLES BAHAMOOT TO FIRE BOLTS OF ELECTRICITY DOWNWARDS FROM ITS UNDERSIDE. 

THE PLAYER CAN ENHANCE A SPECIFIC POWER BY PICKING UP THE SAME TYPE OF ORB, THIS CAN BE DONE UP TO THREE TIMES. 

DRAGON BREED ALSO INCLUDES PLATFORMING ELEMENTS. AT CERTAIN POINTS DURING A STAGE HORIZONTAL PLATFORMS APPEAR, THESE OFTEN HAVE POWER-UPS ON THEM AND THE DRAGON RIDER CAN DISMOUNT AND RUN ALONG THE PLATFORMS WHILE THE DRAGON WAITS ABOVE.</desc>

		<desc>DYNA GEAR IS A SCROLLING PLATFORM RUN 'N' GUN GAME FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS IN WHICH TWO STARSHIPS FROM THE YEAR 2993 AD FALL THROUGH A TIME-HOLE AND END UP 65 MILLION YEARS IN THE PAST, ABOVE A PREHISTORIC EARTH-LIKE PLANET. ONE SHIP IS PILOTED BY HERO AND 'TIME PATROLLER', ROGER, WHILE THE OTHER IS PILOTED BY THE EVIL GUSTAF. THE TWO SHIPS SHOOT EACH DOWN AND CRASH-LAND ONTO THE PLANET BELOW, WHERE ROGER DISCOVERS THAT GUSTAF HAS TRANSFORMED MANY OF THE PLANET'S DINOSAURS INTO AGGRESSIVE 'COMBAT DINOSAURS'. 

PLAYERS TAKE CONTROL OF EITHER THE MUSCULAR HERO, ROGER, OR OF WOLF; A BIPEDAL WOLFMAN WHO WANTS TO FREE HIS PREHISTORIC HOMEWORLD FROM GUSTAF'S CLUTCHES. THEY MUST BATTLE THROUGH SEVERAL DINOSAUR-INFESTED STAGES IN THEIR QUEST TO END GUSTAF'S PLANS. 

DIFFERENT WEAPONS AND HEALTH BOOSTS CAN BE FOUND IN THE DESTRUCTIBLE WOODEN CHESTS THAT LITTER THE STAGES, ENEMIES ALSO DROP COINS WHEN KILLED THAT CAN BE COLLECTED FOR BONUS POINTS. 

EACH OF THE TWO HEROES ALSO HAS A 'DOUBLE-JUMP' MOVE; PLAYERS CAN JUMP, THEN JUMP AGAIN WHILE STILL IN THE AIR. THIS ALLOWS THEM TO REACH PREVIOUSLY INACCESSIBLE LEDGES AND PLATFORMS AS WELL AS OCCASIONALLY TAKE DIFFERENT ROUTES THROUGH A STAGE. IN THE SINGLE-PLAYER GAME, A WOLFMAN WILL OCCASIONALLY JOIN WITH THE PLAYER TO AID IN THE FIGHT. A LARGE, POWERFUL 'BOSS' DINOSAUR GUARDS THE END OF EACH STAGE AND MUST BE DEFEATED TO PROGRESS.</desc>

THERE ARE FOUR BOATS, ONE IN EACH CORNER OF THE SCREEN. IF THERE WERE LESS THAN FOUR PLAYERS THEN THE COMPUTER PLAYED THE REMAINDER. AS THE BOATS SAIL OUT THEY LEAVE A CONTINUOUS TRAIL OF MINES BEHIND. THE PLAYERS CAN CONTROL THE DIRECTION AND, WITH A SINGLE BUTTON, STOP TWO MINES FROM BEING LAID IN EVERY TWELVE.

EACH TIME A BOAT HITS ANOTHER BOAT, A MINE, THE SCREEN EDGE OR CUBA, IT EXPLODES AND THE SURVIVING BOATS EACH GET ONE POINT. THIS CONTINUES UNTIL ZERO OR ONE BOAT IS LEFT. (IF TWO BOATS COLLIDE THEY BOTH BLOW UP.) I BELIEVE THERE WERE FOUR ROUNDS PER GAME. THE STRATEGY WAS TO BLOCK OFF AS MUCH OPEN WATER AS YOU COULD WHILE LEAVING A HOLE IN YOUR LINE OF MINES SO YOU COULD DOUBLE BACK AND DUCK THROUGH IT.</desc>

JUMPS CAN ONLY BE PERFORMED AT SPECIFIC LOCATIONS ON EACH TRACK. THESE LOCATIONS FEATURE A DIRT RAMP THAT SPREADS ACROSS THE WIDTH OF THE TRACK. PLAYERS MUST HAVE THE BIKE IN THE 'WHEELIE' POSITION WHEN THE RAMP IS STRUCK, THE BIKE WILL THEN BE LAUNCHED INTO THE AIR. IF THE BIKE IS NOT IN A WHEELIE POSITION WHEN THE RAMPS ARE STRUCK, THE BIKE WILL STILL CLEAR THE RAMP, BUT WILL LAND FRONT-WHEEL FIRST AND CRASH.

ENDURO RACER IS PERHAPS BEST REMEMBERED FOR ITS 'WHEELIE' FEATURE, WHICH REQUIRED THE PLAYER TO PHYSICALLY LIFT THE CABINET'S HANDLEBARS TO RAISE THE FRONT WHEEL OF THE GAME'S ON-SCREEN COUNTERPART.</desc>

ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE ROBOT MONSTERS IS A ONE OR TWO-PLAYER GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYERS MUST RESCUE DR. SARAH BELLUM FROM PLANET X, WHERE HER RESEARCH FACILITY HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER BY THE EVIL REPTILONS. THE GAME IS PLAYED FROM AN ISOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE WHERE PLAYERS CONTROL THEIR AVATARS USING HALL EFFECT JOYSTICKS. THE HALL EFFECT IS THE PRODUCTION OF A VOLTAGE DIFFERENCE (THE HALL VOLTAGE) ACROSS AN ELECTRICAL CONDUCTOR, TRANSVERSE TO AN ELECTRIC CURRENT IN THE CONDUCTOR AND A MAGNETIC FIELD PERPENDICULAR TO THE CURRENT. IT WAS DISCOVERED BY EDWIN HALL IN 1879.

THE PLAYER MUST SHOOT THEIR WAY THROUGH A SERIES OF SIMPLE MAZE-LIKE LEVELS, RELEASING THE HUMAN HOSTAGES ALONG THE WAY. LEVERS MUST BE FOUND AND THROWN TO ACTIVATE THE ESCALATORS WHICH ALLOW ACCESS TO NEW AREAS. GEMS CAN BE COLLECTED TO INCREASE THE POWER OF THE PLAYER'S RAY GUN, AND FOOD LOCKERS MAY BE BROKEN INTO FOR A HEALTH BOOST.

AT THE END OF EACH LEVEL THE PLAY SWITCHES TO AN ISOMETRIC AUTO-SCROLLING SEQUENCE IN WHICH THE PLAYER CONTROLS HIS CHARACTER IN A SMALL SPACESHIP, AND MUST STEER LEFT OR RIGHT TO NAVIGATE THROUGH A MAZE OF OBSTACLES. IF THE PLAYER REACHES THE END OF THIS SEQUENCE THEY WILL PROGRESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL.</desc>

AN UNUSUAL TAKE ON THE OVERHEAD RACING GENRE, ESCAPE KIDS HAS UP TO 4 PLAYERS TAKING ON THE ROLE OF AN ATHLETIC RUNNER AND COMPETING TO BE THE FIRST TO CROSS THE FINISH LINE IN A NUMBER OF 3-LAP RACES. AS WELL AS RUNNING, EACH PLAYER HAS A LIMITED NUMBER OF 'SUPER JUMPS'; THESE ALLOW THE PLAYER TO LEAP OVER BOTH RIVAL RUNNERS AND OBSTACLES.

MONEY IS AWARDED FOR FINISHING FIRST, AND PLAYERS CAN UPGRADE THEIR RUNNER DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY HAVE AVAILABLE. RUNNERS CAN BE GIVEN EXTRA SUPER JUMPS, AN UPGRADE TO STOP THE RUNNER FROM SKIDDING WHEN GOING THROUGH A BEND IN THE TRACK, QUICKER RECOVERY TIME FROM FALLS, OR BE MADE STRONGER (AND THUS LESS LIKELY TO BE KNOCKED OVER BY A RIVAL RUNNER). SPECIAL ITEMS OCCASIONALLY APPEAR AND CAN BE PICKED UP AND USED. THESE RANGE FROM AN ITEM THAT CAUSES A SMALL EARTHQUAKE (CAUSING ALL OF THE RIVAL RUNNERS TO TUMBLE ALONG THE GROUND, THUS SLOWING THEM DOWN) AND A BOMB, WHICH RENDERS ANY RUNNER THAT RUNS INTO IT UNABLE TO MOVE FOR SEVERAL SECONDS.

EACH RACE HAS A TOTAL OF FIVE COMPETITORS (EITHER HUMAN OR COMPUTER CONTROLLED) AND PLAYERS MUST FINISH IN FIRST PLACE OR ARE DISQUALIFIED. ANY PLAYER WHO WINS ALL THREE RACES IN A ROUND WILL BE TAKEN TO A BONUS SCREEN. HERE, THE PLAYER'S ON-SCREEN COUNTERPART RIDES A BIKE AND THE PLAYER MUST COLLECT AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE.</desc>

BY 2018, TOKYO HAS REACHED ITS MAXIMUM EXTENSION, THEREFORE FALLING PREY OF COMMON PROBLEMS SUCH AS OVERPOPULATION AND CRIMINALITY. FOR THIS REASON, AN ARTIFICIAL ISLAND, APTLY NAMED TOKYO-2, IS CREATED JUST OFFSHORE, THANKS TO THE SUPPORT OF THE SHADY "YAKSA" CORPORATION, LED BY ELUSIVE BILLIONAIRE GARRA ONO, WHOSE TIES WITH THE MODERN INCARNATION OF YAKUZA HAVE NOT BEEN PROVEN. ANOTHER SOURCE OF INSTABILITY IS GIVEN BY THE RISING NUMBER OF HUMANS EXHIBITING EXTRASENSORY PERCEPTION, THE SO-CALLED ESPERS, WHO ARE CONSTANTLY HUNTED DOWN BY THE JAPANESE POLICE FORCE. UNKNOWN TO EVERYONE, GARRA HERSELF IS AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL ESPER, BENT ON USING HER INFLUENCE OVER THE GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY TO REPLACE EVERY LIVING BEING IN THE CITY WITH CLONES (DISTURBINGLY ENOUGH, THESE ESPERS TAKE THE FORM OF A 10 YEARS OLD GIRL, NAMED "ALICE" AND IMPLIED TO ORIGINATE FROM GARRA'S OWN DNA). JUST AS HER PLANS BEGIN TO UNFOLD, THREE CHILDREN ARE FORCED TO TAKE ACTION, EACH ONE FOR HIS OR HER OWN PERSONAL MOTIVES.

IN AN OTHERWISE PEACEFUL WORLD, THE SHINRA EMPIRE BEGAN CONQUERING NEARBY NATIONS ONE BY ONE TO EXPAND THEIR TERRITORY GRADUALLY. MEANWHILE, IN THE SHINRA WEAPONS LAB, THE ESPGALUDA PROJECT PRODUCED TWO SUCCESSFUL PROTOTYPES: AGAHA AND TATEHA. FEARING FOR THEIR FUTURE, THE PROJECT'S HEAD SCIENTIST, HIODOSHI, ESCAPED WITH THE TWO PROTOTYPES TO A NEARBY KINGDOM, BUT TIME AFTER WERE FOUND BY SHINRA'S TROOPS AND HIODOSHI WAS KILLED BY THE ATTACK OF THE IMPERIAL ARMY, THE POWER OF THE GALUDA HAS AWAKEN. 

YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF CONTROLLING ONE OF TWO SIBLINGS EACH WITH DIFFERENT SKILLS, AGEHA  FASTER BUT WITH NARROWER SHOOTING CAPABILITIES OR TATEHA SLOWER BUT WITH A WIDER ATTACK. AS YOU FLY THROUGH THE VARIOUS STAGES VARIOUS MECHANICAL ENEMIES ATTACK WITH A HIGH NUMBER OF BULLETS, OFTEN NEARLY FILLING THE SCREEN. ASIDE FROM THE REGULAR SHOTS, AGEHA AND TATEHA ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL ABILITIES WHICH HELP THE PLAYER NAVIGATE THROUGH THE NUMEROUS BULLETS. THE FIRST IS A GUARD BARRIER; WHEN ACTIVATED THE PLAYER IS IMMUNE TO COLLISIONS AND AS A BONUS WHEN THE BARRIER BUTTON IS RELEASED A MORE POWERFUL LASER SHOT IS FIRED. A METER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN INDICATES HOW MUCH POWER IS LEFT IN THE BARRIER. THE SECOND ABILITY IS CALLED THE KAKUSEI MODE; WHEN THIS MODE IS ACTIVATED YOUR CHARACTER GENDER IS ALTERED AND IS ABLE TO FIRE A MORE POWERFUL SHOT. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHEN THIS MODE IS ACTIVATED ALL OF THE ENEMIES AND THEIR BULLETS SLOW DOWN CONSIDERABLY WHILE THE PLAYERS SPEED REMAINS THE SAME MAKING IT EASIER TO NAVIGATE THROUGH A TRICKY PATTERN OF BULLETS. ACTIVATING KAKUSEI MODE WILL RAPIDLY DEPLETE THE PLAYERS SUPPLY OF GREEN GEMS; SINCE THE NUMBER OF GEMS ISN'T LIMITLESS THE PLAYER MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN KAKUSEI MODE FOR LONG. WHEN NOT IN KAKUSEI MODE ADDITIONAL GEMS CAN BE COLLECTED BY DESTROYING THE VARIOUS ENEMIES. IF THE PLAYER COMPLETELY RUNS OUT OF GEMS, ENEMY BULLETS BEGIN TRAVELLING FASTER THAN USUAL. ANOTHER BONUS IN THE GAME IS GOLD INGUTS WHICH GREATLY INCREASE THE PLAYERS SCORE. THESE ARE FOUND WHEN IN KAKUSEI MODE; WHEN AN ENEMY IS DESTROYED, ALL OF ITS BULLETS WILL TURN INTO INGOTS WHICH CAN BE COLLECTED BY THE PLAYER.</desc>

THE GAMEPLAY IS VERY SIMILAR TO SEGA'S OWN SHINOBI, AS THE PLAYER HAS THE ABILITY TO JUMP UP AND DOWN BETWEEN PLANES WHERE POSSIBLE. THE GOAL OF EACH OF THE GAME'S 15 STAGES IS TO FIND AND ARREST A SPECIFIC WANTED CRIMINAL, WHO IS USUALLY FOUGHT AT THE END OF THE STAGE AS A BOSS. DUKE IS INITIALLY ARMED WITH ONLY A SINGLE-SHOT PISTOL, BUT UPON ARRESTING THE FIRST THREE CRIMINALS AND BEING PROMOTED TO ESWAT, DUKE IS EQUIPPED WITH A POWER SUIT WITH A MOUNTED MACHINE GUN FOR THE REST OF THE GAME. THE SUIT ALSO HAS ACCESS TO LIMITED-USE SPECIAL WEAPONS WHICH CAN BE FOUND WITHIN STAGES. HOWEVER, BOTH OF DUKE'S STANDARD WEAPONS REQUIRE AMMUNITION, WITHOUT WHICH THE PLAYER CAN ONLY ATTACK WITH A KICK. ADDITIONAL AMMUNITION CAN BE FOUND IN BOXES THROUGHOUT EACH STAGE.</desc>

WHAT MADE EXED EXES STAND APART FROM OTHER SHOOTERS, BESIDES THE HIGH RESOLUTION GRAPHICS FOR ITS TIME, AND THE DETAILED USE OF PARALLAX SCROLLING TO INDICATE DEPTH, WAS THE FACT THAT IT WAS ONE OF THE EARLIEST VERTICAL SHOOTERS TO ALLOW FOR TWO PLAYER SIMULTANEOUS PLAY. RATHER THAN WAITING FOR ONE PLAYER TO TAKE HIS TURN, TWO PLAYERS COULD ENJOY THE GAME AT THE SAME TIME, AND EVEN WORK COOPERATIVELY TO GET FURTHER ALONG IN THE GAME.</desc>

		<desc>EXERION IS A VERTICAL SHOOTER THAT IS OPERATED WITH AN 8 DIRECTION JOYSTICK AND TWO FIRE BUTTONS. THE GAME'S BIGGEST FEATURES ARE THE PARALLAX SCROLLING WHICH OCCURS IN THE BACKGROUND, AND THE SENSATION OF INERTIA THAT IS APPLIED TO THE MOTION OF THE SHIP. THE SHIP IS EQUIPPED WITH TWO KINDS OF WEAPONS. YOU CAN FIRE THE DUAL SHOT GUN WHICH CAN ONLY RELEASE ONE PAIR OF SHOTS ON THE SCREEN AT A TIME, BUT HAS AN UNLIMITED SUPPLY, BY TAPPING THE FIRST FIRE BUTTON. THE SINGLE SHOT GUN CAN FIRE A RAPID STREAM OF SHOTS ON THE SCREEN AT ONE TIME BY HOLDING THE SECOND FIRE BUTTON DOWN, BUT IT IS LIMITED IN AMMO ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF CHARGES INDICATED ON THE BOTTOM. EACH WEAPON IS BEST USED IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS, IN ORDER TO DEFEAT THE ENEMIES WHICH COME FLYING DOWN FROM THE TOP PART OF THE SCREEN.

DUE TO THE INERTIA OF THE SHIP, YOU MUST INPUT ANY REVERSE IN DIRECTION MUCH SOONER IN ORDER TO CANCEL THE SHIPS MOMENTUM. THIS WAS NOT A COMMON FEATURE FOR SIMILAR GAMES THAT CAME OUT AROUND THE SAME TIME, SO IT DISTINGUISHED EXERION FROM OTHER SHOOTERS. BECAUSE THE FAMICOM CONVERSION WAS PLAYED ON A HORIZONTAL SCREEN, THE ENEMIES APPEARED MUCH CLOSER TO THE PLAYER'S SHIP, WHICH CHANGES THE FEEL OF THE GAME SINCE YOU HAVE TO REACT TO THE ENEMIES' LOCATION MUCH SOONER.</desc>

		<desc>THE WILD WEST-THEMED EXPRESS RAIDER IS SEPARATED INTO TWO DIFFERENT GAME TYPES; A SIDEWAYS SCROLLING FIGHTING SEQUENCE AND A SHOOTING SEQUENCE. THE PLAYER CONTROLS A TRAIN ROBBER, OR 'EXPRESS RAIDER', AND MUST TRY TO STEAL THE BAGS OF MONEY FROM THE MOVING LOCOMOTIVES.

DURING THE FIGHTING SEQUENCE, THE RAIDER MUST FIGHT THE BANK TELLER, HIT THE COYOTES AND THEN JUMP ONTO THE TRAIN BEFORE IT SPEEDS AWAY. ONCE ON THE TRAIN, HE MUST FIGHT HIS WAY PAST OTHER ENEMIES AND AVOID VARIOUS PROJECTILES, SUCH AS BOTTLES, BULLETS AND SHOVELS FULL OF COAL. PLAYERS MUST BE CAREFUL TO DUCK UNDER THE LOW SIGNS THAT COME ALONG AS THE TRAIN IS TRAVELLING. ALSO, ONCE A TRAIN CARRIAGE IS CLEAR OF ENEMIES, A BOMB WILL APPEAR BETWEEN THE CURRENT CARRIAGE AND THE NEXT; PLAYERS MUST QUICKLY JUMP OVER TO THE NEXT CARRIAGE BEFORE THE BOMB GOES OFF, OTHERWISE THE RAIDER WILL FALL FROM THE TRAIN AND A LIFE IS LOST. IF THE EXPRESS RAIDER MANAGES TO REACH THE TRAIN ENGINE, THE LOOT WILL BE CAPTURED AND THE GAME WILL THEN MOVE ON TO THE SHOOTING SEQUENCE.

IN THE SHOOTING SEQUENCE, THE EXPRESS RAIDER RIDES A HORSE AND MUST SHOOT AT THE ENEMIES THAT APPEAR FROM THE WINDOWS OF A TRAIN CARRIAGE. THEY WILL SHOOT BACK AT THE PLAYER AND THROW VARIOUS OBJECTS. PLAYERS CAN HIT THE DUCK BUTTON TO AVOID THE ENEMY ATTACKS. A WOMAN WILL APPEAR AT REGULAR INTERVALS OFFERING THE PLAYER A BAG OF MONEY, IF THE PLAYER SHOOTS THE WOMAN, A LIFE IS LOST. AFTER THE SHOOTING SEQUENCE HAS BEEN COMPLETED, THE GAME WILL START OVER AGAIN WITH AN INCREASED LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY.</desc>

THE PLAYERS MUST TAKE UP CONTROL OF FOUR MEDIEVAL LORDS WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR CONTROL OF THE LAND. THEY HAVE TO BATTLE THROUGH EIGHT DIFFERENT CASTLES, AND TRY TO GAIN CONTROL OF EACH ONE. WHEN ONE OF THE LORDS WINS A BATTLE, HE SHALL RECEIVE A MEDAL - AND ONCE HE HAS WON THREE MEDALS, HE WILL GAIN CONTROL OF THE CURRENT CASTLE (WHICH MEANS THAT THEY CAN BE UP TO SIX ROOMS LONG) AND THE GAME WILL PROCEED TO THE NEXT CASTLE. THE GAMEPLAY IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF HUDSON SOFT'S BOMBERMAN SERIES, THE INITIAL TITLE OF WHICH WAS ADAPTED BY IREM FOR THE ARCADE IN 1991.</desc>

F-1 DREAM IS NOT ONE OF CAPCOM'S BEST KNOWN GAMES. FROM A TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE AND DECORATED WITH CUTE "DEFORMED" GRAPHICS, IT MAY OFFER A SERIOUS CHALLENGE. THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY TWO RACE INSTANCES: FIRST YOU HAVE TO BEAT THE CLOCK IN A SINGLE LAP TO QUALIFY FOR A GOOD POSITION IN THE RACE, AND SECOND YOU HAVE TO BEAT YOUR OPPONENTS. YOU ALSO HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR CAR'S CONDITION, AS THE TYRES AND BODY WEAR OUT, SO PART OF YOUR STRATEGY MUST CONSIDER PIT STOPS.

DESPITE ITS LOOKS, F-1 DREAM IS NOT A PARODY GAME. RELEASED IN 1988, IT'S IN FACT VERY RESPECTFUL TOWARDS THE SPORT, FEATURING LITTLE DETAILS WHICH ADD REALISM TO IT. THIS INCLUDES SEVERAL REAL BRANDS ADVERTISED IN THE GAME, AND OTHERS WHICH HAVE ONE OR TWO LETTERS CHANGED IN THE LOGO, BUT ARE VERY EASY TO RECOGNIZE. SO IT IS WITH YOUR OPPONENTS, FEATURING THE GREAT AYRTON SENNA, ALAIN PROST OR NIGEL MANSELL. THE CAR BEHAVIOR ALSO FEATURES SKIDS WHEN SPEEDING AT CORNERS, GEARS, AND DAMAGE.</desc>

		<desc>FIGHTER'S HISTORY IS THE FIRST ATTEMPT OF DATA EAST TO ENTER IN COMPETITION WITH CAPCOM AND ITS OMNIPRESENT STREET FIGHTER II. BECAUSE THE MANY SIMILARITIES SHARED BY THE GAME WITH THE CAPCOM MASTERPIECE (LIKE THE CHARACTER SELECT SCREEN, THE VS AND WINNER/LOSER SCREENS, THE CONTROLS AND THE DESIGN AND MOVES OF SOME CHARACTERS), FIGHTER'S HISTORY WAS AT LEAST SIMPLY STAMPED BY MOST OF THE  PLAYERS LIKE ANOTHER SFII CLONE, AND IN THIS WAY REMAINED IGNORED AND OBSCURED TO THE MASS AUDIENCE.

ALTHOUGH TIME AFTER, THE MANY BEAT'EM UP FANS LEARNT TO APPRECIATE THIS MAYBE TOO UNDERESTIMATED FIGHTING GAME, ESPECIALLY FOR ITS COMBO SYSTEM, QUITE SIMPLE TO EXECUTE EVEN FOR THOSE PLAYERS NOT SO ABLE WITH TIMING AND BUTTON PRESSING, AND FOR ITS FAST GAMEPLAY: AT THIS PURPOSE MOST OF THE CONTRIBUTION WAS MADE BY THE UPDATED VERSION RELEASED IN 1994, FIGHTER'S HISTORY DYNAMITE (KNOWN AS KARNOV'S REVENGE IN USA AND EUROPE) THAT MADE THE GAMEPLAY MORE POLISHED. DESPITE THIS AT LEAST FIGHTER'S HISTORY NEVER REACHED THAT GREAT SUCCESS THAT MAYBE DATA EAST STILL TRIED TO ACHIEVE.

PLAYERS CHOOSE ONE OF 9 INTERNATIONAL FIGHTERS AND BATTLE TO BE THE BEST IN THE WORLD. EVERY CHARACTER HAS HIS ENDING SEQUENCE AND HIS OWN STAGE. THERE ARE ALSO TWO NOT-SELECTABLE BOSSES TO CHALLENGE FOR REACH THE END, AND THE LAST ONE OF THEM IS REAL SURPRISING!</desc>

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME IS TO FIND AND DESTROY THE ENEMY'S SUBMARINE, WHILE AVOIDING THE ENEMY'S TORPEDOES. THROUGH YOUR VIRTUAL PERISCOPE YOU ARE FREE TO LAUNCH ONE OF YOUR 8 TORPEDOES TO TAKE OUT ANY OF THE ENEMY'S VARIOUS SHIPS FOR EXTRA POINTS. IT TAKES SOME TIME TO RELOAD EACH TORPEDO TUBE, SO YOU MUST BE JUDICIOUS IN HOW YOU PLAN YOUR ATTACKS.

IN ADDITION TO BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THE LEFT/RIGHT ROTATION OF YOUR PERISCOPE, THE GAME ALSO FEATURES A SUBMERGE BUTTON WHICH YOU CAN USE TO TEMPORARILY HIDE FROM THE ENEMY. HOLDING THIS BUTTON DOWN KEEPS YOU HIDDEN BUT ALSO KEEPS YOU OUT OF THE ACTION, ALLOWING THE ENEMY FREE REIGN OVER THE SEAS.</desc>

		<desc>FROGGER IS A ONE OR TWO-PLAYER GAME IN WHICH PLAYERS MUST OVERCOME A NUMBER OF HAZARDS TO SAFELY GUIDE THE GREEN AMPHIBIAN FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN TO ONE OF FIVE HOME BASES SITUATED AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN.

THE LOWER HALF OF THE SCREEN CONSISTS OF A BI-DIRECTIONAL FLOW OF TRAFFIC MOVING ACROSS FIVE LANES. TO NAVIGATE ACROSS THE ROAD SAFELY, FROGGER'S HOPS MUST BE TIMED TO AVOID THE VEHICLES, WHICH INCLUDE BUSES, CIVILIAN TRAFFIC AND RACING CARS, WITH DIFFERENT VEHICLE TYPES MOVING AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS. AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO HOP VERTICALLY, FROGGER CAN ALSO MOVE LEFT AND RIGHT, ALLOWING HIM TO MOVE WITH THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC. 

THE UPPER HALF OF THE SCREEN CONSISTS OF A FAST-FLOWING RIVER POPULATED WITH LOGS, CROCODILES AND TURTLES. FROGGER WILL DROWN IF HE HAS ANY CONTACT WITH THE WATER AND THESE ACT AS PLATFORMS ONTO WHICH FROGGER CAN HOP. HE MUST BE CAREFUL TO AVOID CONTACT WITH CROCODILES' SNAPPING JAWS, HOWEVER AND SOME OF THE TURTLES WILL PERIODICALLY DIVE BELOW THE WATER'S SURFACE, DROWNING FROGGER. FROGGER WILL ALSO DIE IF HE IS ON A LOG, TURTLE OR CROCODILE WHEN IT REACHES THE EDGE OF THE SCREEN.

ON THE LOGS OF THE RIVER SECTION A FEMALE FROG WILL OCCASIONALLY APPEAR AND BONUS POINTS ARE AWARDED IF FROGGER SUCCESSFULLY ESCORTS HER SAFELY HOME. A FLY ALSO APPEARS RANDOMLY IN A HOME BASE AND BONUS POINTS ARE AWARDED IF FROGGER ENTERS THE BASE WHEN THE FLY IS PRESENT. CONVERSELY, A CROCODILE MAY ALSO APPEAR IN A HOME BASE AND A LIFE IS LOST IF FROGGER ENTERS THE BASE WHILE THE CROCODILE IS PRESENT.

A ROUND IS COMPLETED ONCE FIVE FROGS HAVE BEEN GUIDED SAFELY HOME, AFTER WHICH THE NEXT ROUND BEGINS WITH AN INCREASED LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY. THIS INCLUDES FASTER-MOVING VEHICLES ON THE ROAD SECTION AND NEW, DEADLY HAZARDS ON THE RIVER SECTION, INCLUDING CROCODILES, OTTERS AND SNAKES.</desc>

		<name>Gaia Crusaders</name>
		<desc>GAIA CRUSADERS IS A ONE OR TWO-PLAYER SIDE-SCROLLING BEAT-EM-UP IN WHICH PLAYERS MUST BATTLE SATAN AND HIS ARMY OF DEMONS THAT HAVE CAPTURED AND TAKEN OVER THE WORLD. PLAYERS SELECT A CHARACTER FROM A CHOICE OF FIVE COMBATANTS KNOWN AS 'ELEMENTAL WARRIORS'. EACH OF THE CHARACTERS POSSESSES EITHER WIND STRENGTH, FIRE STRENGTH, OR A MIX OF THE TWO. 

THE GAME HAS THE STANDARD PUNCH AND KICK ATTACK MOVES AS WELL AS MAGICAL SPECIAL MOVES. COMBOS CAN BE STRUNG TOGETHER BY SWITCHING QUICKLY BETWEEN KICKING AND PUNCHING. PLAYERS CAN ALSO PERFORM A 'SUPER ATTACK' BY PRESSING THE JUMP, PUNCH AND KICK BUTTONS SIMULTANEOUSLY, THIS HITS MANY ENEMIES AT ONCE BUT COSTS THE PLAYER CHARACTER SOME HEALTH. IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO RAISE A SHIELD BY PRESSING JUMP AND KICK SIMULTANEOUSLY.

AT REGULAR INTERVALS COLOURED SPHERES APPEAR, PLAYERS CAN PICK THESE UP TO GAIN A MAGICAL ATTACK. THE EFFECTS OF THE MAGIC ATTACK DIFFERS DEPENDING ON THE PLAYER CHARACTER. IF THE MAGIC MATCHES THE CHARACTER'S ELEMENTAL ATTRIBUTE (FIRE, WIND OR BOTH), THEY WILL GAIN A SPECIAL, SCREEN-CLEARING ATTACK. OTHERWISE, THEY EARN A POWERFUL SPECIAL ATTACK. 

IN ADDITION TO THE ELEMENTAL SPHERES, THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF BOMBS THAT ALSO APPEAR, BOTH OF WHICH DETONATE IMMEDIATELY ONCE PICKED UP. THE FIRST IS AN EARTHQUAKE THAT HITS ALL ON-SCREEN ENEMIES AND INFLICTS A LARGE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE. THE SECOND IS A RANDOM BOMB THAT SENDS OUT PILLARS OF FIRE, HURTING ANY ENEMIES THEY COME INTO CONTACT WITH. THERE ARE ALSO EXPLOSIVE BOXES THAT CAN BE KICKED AT ENEMIES TO KEEP THEM AT BAY. ONE LAST NOTABLE ITEM IS THE SWORD, WHICH FUNCTIONS MUCH LIKE WEAPONS THAT CAN BE FOUND ON THE GROUND IN MANY OTHER BEAT 'EM UPS. A BOSS BATTLE AWAITS PLAYERS AT THE END OF EACH STAGE.

GAIA CRUSADERS IS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY ANOTHER SCROLLING BEAT-EM-UP, CAPCOM'S 1989 CLASSIC, FINAL FIGHT AND ALSO, TO A LESSER DEGREE, BY SEGA'S GOLDEN AXE (THE LATTER BEING THE USE OF THE MAGICAL ATTACK ACTING AS A SMART BOMB).</desc>

		<desc>GALAGA '88 IS AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE OLD FAVORITE, "GALAGA", WITH MORE INVADERS AND MORE PLAYER FIREPOWER. GALAGA '88 GIVES PLAYERS A CHANCE TO ONCE AGAIN REPEL THE INVADERS FROM THE GALAGAN KINGDOM. ONE OR TWO PLAYERS CAN TRY THEIR HAND AT FIGHTING THE INVADERS. THIS TIME THE GALAGANS HAVE FOUR MORE ALLIES, EACH WITH UNIQUE WEAPONS AND DEFENSES THAT A PLAYER MUST OVERCOME. 

BY DESTROYING SPECIAL ENEMIES OR OBSTACLES THE PLAYER CAN GET 'ITEMS'. WHEN A PLAYER HAS TWO ITEMS, THEY CAN WARP TO ANOTHER DIMENSION TO CONFRONT MORE GALAGAN SHIPS WITH NEW STRATEGIES. IN THE CHALLENGING STAGES (LABELLED IN THIS GAME AS 'THAT'S GALACTIC DANCIN'), THE PLAYER SHOOTS DOWN AS MANY INVADERS AS POSSIBLE AS THE GALAGANS DANCE TO A WALTZ, TANGO, MARCH OR JAZZ TUNE. 

THE PLAYER SELECTS SINGLE OR DUAL SHIP POWER. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DESTROY ALL THE GALAGAN FOES IN EACH OF THE 29 SECTORS OF THE GALAXY, WITH EACH SECTOR MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE LAST. 

UNIQUE FEATURES: 
MORE OPPONENTS. IN ADDITION TO BOSS, GOEI AND ZAKO, THE ORIGINAL GALAGAN CREW, DON, NIN, BAN, AND GAN HAVE BEEN ADDED. EACH OF THE GALAGANS HAS A UNIQUE WAY OF CHALLENGING THE PLAYERS. 
DIFFERENT TYPES OF SHIPS. PLAYERS CAN CHOOSE SINGLE OR DUAL SHIPS (IF THE GAME OPTION IS SET FOR DUAL AND SINGLE). WHEN THE PLAYER RETRIEVES A DUAL SHIP FROM THE BOSS'S TRACTOR BEAM, IT TURNS INTO A TRIPLE SHIP WITH TEN TIMES THE POWER OF A SINGLE SHIP. 
CHALLENGING STAGES. IN THE 'THAT'S GALACTIC DANCIN' STAGES, THE GALAGAN INVADERS DANCE TO A WALTZ, TANGO, SOUSA MARCH OR JAZZ TUNE, WHILE THE PLAYER SHOOTS DOWN GALAGANS TO EARN BONUS POINTS. 
WARPING TO A NEW DIMENSION. BY DESTROYING PARTICULAR ENEMIES OR OBSTACLES AND CAPTURING TWO OF THEIR ITEMS, THE PLAYER CAN WARP TO THE NEXT DIMENSION. 
PLAYER CHALLENGE. EACH DIMENSION HAS DIFFERENT MIX OF GALAGANS WITH DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO BE OVERCOME. 
WIN BACK CAPTURED SHIPS. THE PLAYER CAN WIN BACK SHIPS CAPTURED IN THE BOSS GALAGA'S TRACTOR BEAM. WHEN THE PLAYER DESTROYS THE BOSS, THE SHIPS ARE RELEASED. IF THE PLAYER RETRIEVES THEM, THE SHIPS BECOME DUAL SHIPS IF THEY WERE SINGLE AND TRIPLE IF THEY WERE DUAL. 
HIGH SCORE MODE. UPON COMPLETING A GAME, A PLAYER CAN ENTER HIS INITIALS IF THEY ARE AMONG THE TOP EIGHT SCORERS ON THE GAME.</desc>

		<desc>GALAXIAN IS A LEGENDARY SINGLE-SCREEN SHOOT-EM-UP THAT TOOK EVERYTHING THAT MADE TAITO'S GROUND-BREAKING "SPACE INVADERS" SO GOOD, AND IMPROVED UPON IT ON EVERY LEVEL. EACH SCREEN STARTS WITH A WAVE OF MULTI-COLORED ALIENS MOVING LEFT AND RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN; THE ALIENS QUICKLY BREAK RANKS AND START DIVE-BOMBING THE GALAXIP (PLAYER'S SHIP) - EITHER IN SINGLE UNITS OR IN GROUPS OF 3 - DROPPING MULTIPLE MISSILES AS THEY DESCEND. ALL OF THE ALIENS NEED TO BE DESTROYED BEFORE THE PLAYER CAN PROGRESS TO THE NEXT WAVE.</desc>

ATARI CHOSE NOT TO TINKER WITH THE CORE GAME-PLAY MECHANIC TO ANY GREAT DEGREE, OPTING INSTEAD TO ENHANCE THE ALREADY EXCELLENT MULTI-PLAYER ACTION THAT HAD CREATED SUCH A STIR UPON THE ORIGINAL GAME'S RELEASE.

AS WITH ITS PREQUEL, UP TO FOUR PLAYERS ONCE AGAIN TAKE ON THE ROLE OF EITHER 'THOR THE WARRIOR', 'THYRA THE VALKYRIE', 'MERLIN THE WIZARD', OR 'QUESTOR THE ELF' AND MUST PLAY COOPERATIVELY AS THEY EXPLORE AND FIGHT THEIR WAY THROUGH THE ENEMY-PACKED MAZES, COLLECTING POTIONS, FOOD AND TREASURE AS THEY SEARCHED FOR THE EXIT THAT WOULD LEAD THEM TO THE NEXT DUNGEON.

CHANGES TO THE SEQUEL INCLUDED THE ABILITY FOR PLAYERS TO PLAY WHATEVER CHARACTER THEY WANTED, EVEN IF THAT CHARACTER WAS ALREADY IN PLAY. CHARACTERS WERE NOW COLOUR-CODED AND PLAYERS WOULD FIND THEMSELVES TAKING ON THE ROLE OF 'BLUE ELF', 'GREEN WIZARD', ETC. NEW IN-GAME SPEECH WAS ADDED TO ALLOW FOR THE NEW PLAYER DEFINITIONS.

OTHER CHANGES INCLUDED THE ABILITY TO 'BOUNCE' SHOTS OFF WALLS - KNOWN AS 'REFLECTIVE SHOTS' - PROVIDING THE CORRECT POTION WAS PICKED UP. AS WELL AS NEW POTIONS, GAUNTLET II ALSO FEATURED SEVERAL NEW MONSTERS. THE MOST NOTORIOUS OF THE NEW ADDITIONS WAS THE FIRE-BREATHING DRAGON THAT GUARDS THE EXIT TO SOME DUNGEONS. THIS POWERFUL CREATURE TAKES MULTIPLE HITS TO KILL AND DEFEATING IT WOULD SEE THE PLAYERS REWARDED WITH A PERMANENT POTION AND A BAG OF TREASURE.

ANOTHER NOTABLE ADDITION WAS THE 'IT' MONSTER: ANY PLAYER WHO WAS TAGGED BY THE CREATURE WOULD SUDDENLY FIND THAT ALL OF THAT LEVEL'S MONSTERS WOULD ONLY CHASE THE TAGGED PLAYER, COMPLETELY IGNORING THE PRESENCE OF ALL OTHER PLAYERS. THE ONLY WAY TO REMOVE THIS CURSE WAS TO TAG ANOTHER PLAYER, THUS MAKING THEM 'IT'.

NEW LEVEL ELEMENTS WERE ALSO ADDED TO FURTHER INCREASE VARIETY. THESE INCLUDED DUNGEONS WITH ENTIRELY INVISIBLE WALLS, MAGICAL WALLS (WHICH CHANGED INTO MONSTERS OR ITEMS WHEN HIT), STUN TILES (WHICH STUNNED ANY PLAYER THAT WALKED ON THEM) AND EXITS THAT FLASHED BETWEEN FUNCTIONING AND NON-FUNCTIONING.</desc>

		<desc>GAUNTLET IS A MAZE-BASED SHOOT-EM-UP FOR UP TO FOUR PLAYERS. HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY CLASSIC FANTASY CONVENTIONS, PLAYERS TAKE ON THE ROLE OF EITHER THOR THE WARRIOR, THYRA THE VALKYRIE, MERLIN THE WIZARD, OR QUESTOR THE ELF AND MUST PLAY COOPERATIVELY AS THEY EXPLORE AND FIGHT THEIR WAY THROUGH THE ENEMY-PACKED MAZES. COMPETITIVE PLAY IS ENCOURAGED AS PLAYERS MUST FIGHT FOR THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF FOOD, TREASURE, MAGIC POTIONS AND POWER-UP ITEMS THAT LITTER THE DUNGEONS. 

EACH OF GAUNTLET'S FOUR CHARACTERS HAVE DIFFERENT STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES: THYRA HAS THE STRONGEST ARMOUR, THOR IS BEST AT HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT, QUESTOR HAS THE FASTEST SPEED AND MERLIN HAS THE MOST POWERFUL MAGIC ATTACKS. THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS SIMPLY TO SURVIVE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE WHILE EXPLORING GAUNTLET'S MAZES IN SEARCH OF TREASURE, FOOD, MAGIC POTIONS AND, ULTIMATELY, THE EXIT THAT LEADS TO THE NEXT DUNGEON. 

THE POTIONS - SHOWN AS BLUE BOTTLES - THAT LITTER THE LEVELS OFFER EITHER IMPROVED CHARACTER ABILITIES (SUCH AS 'SPEED' OR 'EXTRA SHOT POWER') OR CAN BE USED AS A 'SMART BOMB', DESTROYING SOME OR ALL OF THE ON-SCREEN MONSTERS. POTIONS ARE ALSO THE ONLY WAY TO KILL THE GAME'S 'DEATH' CHARACTER THAT APPEARS IN MANY OF THE STAGES. MAGIC POTIONS CAN BE KEPT AND USED AT THE PLAYER'S DISCRETION BY PRESSING 'MAGIC' BUTTON, ALTHOUGH EACH POTION CAN ONLY BE USED ONCE. 

THE FIRST SEVEN MAZES ARE ALWAYS THE SAME, BUT FROM LEVEL 8 ONWARDS, PLAYERS WILL FIND THEMSELVES ON ANY ONE OF OVER A HUNDRED DIFFERENT MAZES. IF PLAYERS SURVIVE FOR LONG ENOUGH, THE MAZES WILL BE REPEATED IN A DIFFERENT ORDER. HOW LONG A PLAYER LASTS DEPENDS UPON THE PLAYER'S 'HEALTH' LEVEL. HEALTH CONTINUALLY DEPLETES AS TIME PROGRESSES AND FURTHER HEALTH IS LOST BY CONTACT WITH VARIOUS MONSTERS OR THEIR PROJECTILES. HEALTH CAN BE REPLENISHED BY CONSUMING THE FOOD FOUND IN THE MAZES OR BY INSERTING MORE CREDITS. THE MANY TREASURE CHESTS THAT LITTER THE LEVELS CAN BE PLUNDERED FOR POINTS, AND COLLECTING TREASURE INCREASES A PLAYER'S SCORE MULTIPLIER WHEN TWO OR MORE PLAYERS ARE PLAYING THE GAME.</desc>

ELE COMBINA A AÇÃO RÁPIDA DE UM JOGO NO ESTILO ARKANOID, COM O PENSAMENTO RÁPIDO DE UM JOGO DO TIPO BUST-A-MOVE. O JOGO FOI COGITADO PARA LANÇAMENTO EM 2001, MAS A MORTE PREMATURA DA SNK NO MESMO ANO PODE TER TERMINADO COM ESSA POSSIBILIDADE. A DATA EAST ERA MAIS CONHECIDA POR SUA SÉRIE CHAIN REACTION/MAGICAL DROP DE JOGOS DE QUEBRA-CABEÇA, E ATÉ MAIS TARDE INCLUIU OS PERSONAGENS DE GHOSTLOP EM UM DOS LANÇAMENTOS POSTERIORES PARA SISTEMAS DE JOGOS DOMÉSTICOS MODERNOS.</desc>

THE PLAYER STARTS THEIR CAREER WITH A 100 PERCENT ACCURACY RATING AND TAKES ON VARIOUS ASSIGNMENTS. EACH ASSIGNMENT BEGINS WITH A 2D COMIC BOOK STORYLINE AND ALTHOUGH IN JAPANESE THEY SHOULD STILL GIVE THE PLAYER SOME IDEA OF THE BACKGROUND STORY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CHOSEN ASSIGNMENT IS THEN DISPLAYED TOGETHER WITH THE TIME LIMIT, TARGET ZONE, AND AVAILABLE AMMUNITION.

AT THE END OF EACH ASSIGNMENT THE PLAYER IS TREATED TO ON SCREEN DISPLAY OF THEIR PERFORMANCE. FOR EACH ASSIGNMENT SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED A LARGE SUM OF CASH IS ADDED TO THE PLAYERÂS TOTAL, PLUS AN EXTRA SUM IS AWARDED FOR HITTING THE TARGET ZONE. IF HOWEVER THE PLAYER FAILS TO COMPLETE THE OBJECTIVE OR THE TIMER REACHES ZERO, THE PLAYERÂS ACCURACY RATING IS REDUCED AND THE PLAYER IS THEN MOVED ON TO CHOOSE THE NEXT ASSIGNMENT. THE GAME IS OVER WHEN THE PLAYERÂS ACCURACY RATING REACHES ZERO.

AT THE START OF THE PLAYERÂS CAREER, 5 DIFFERENT ASSIGNMENTS ARE AVAILABLE TO CHOOSE FROM AND CAN BE COMPLETED IN ANY ORDER. ONCE ALL 5 ASSIGNMENTS HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN A NEW ROUND OF ASSIGNMENTS BECOMES AVAILABLE. IN TOTAL THERE ARE 4 ROUNDS EACH CONSISTING OF 5 ASSIGNMENTS, WITH EACH ROUND BECOMING PROGRESSIVELY HARDER. THE LAST ROUND INCLUDES A SPECIAL STAGE WHICH CAN ONLY BE SELECTED AFTER ALL THE ASSIGNMENTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. UPON COMPLETION OF THE SPECIAL STAGE THE CREDITS ROLL AND THE GAME ENDS. THE PLAYER IS THEN ONCE AGAIN RETURNED TO THE START OF THE GAME.</desc>

		<name>Gorf</name>
		<desc>THE PLAYER'S GOAL IS TO DEFEAT THE GORFIAN EMPIRE AND SAFEGUARD THE FUTURE OF MANKIND. GORF IS A SINGLE SCREEN SHOOT-EM-UP IN THE CLASSIC "SPACE INVADERS" MOULD, THE PRIME DIFFERENCE BEING THAT GORF OFFERS FIVE DISTINCT LEVELS OF SHOOTING ACTION. THE LEVELS ARE AS FOLLOWS: 

MISSION 1 - ASTRO BATTLES: THE FIRST MISSION IS MORE OR LESS A STRAIGHT CLONE OF "SPACE INVADERS", SET AGAINST A SKY-BLUE BACKGROUND. THE PLAYER IS PROTECTED BY A GLITTERING PARABOLIC FORCE FIELD, WHICH IS GRADUALLY WORN AWAY BY ENEMY PROJECTILES. THE FORCE FIELD ALSO WORKS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, AND THEREFORE MUST MOMENTARILY DEACTIVATE IN ORDER FOR THE PLAYER'S SHIP TO FIRE OUT. TO ADVANCE TO THE NEXT MISSION, THE PLAYER MUST DESTROY ALL THE INVADERS. 
MISSION 2 - LASER ATTACK: THE OTHER MISSIONS ARE ALL SET IN SPACE. IN THIS MISSION, THE PLAYER IS FACED WITH TWO FORMATIONS EACH MADE UP OF FIVE ENEMIES. THE FORMATIONS ARE CROSS-SHAPED, AND AT THE BOTTOM OF EACH FORMATION IS A SINGLE LASER GUN. THE LASER GUNS FIRE A LONG, DANGEROUS YELLOW BEAM AT REGULAR INTERVALS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE OTHER ENEMIES MAY BREAK FORMATION AND ATTEMPT TO DIVE-BOMB THE PLAYER. DESTROYING A LASER GUN CAUSES THE CORRESPONDING FORMATION TO BREAK APART. TO ADVANCE TO THE NEXT MISSION, THE PLAYER MUST DESTROY ALL THE ENEMIES. 
MISSION 3 - GALAXIANS: THIS MISSION IS A CLONE OF "GALAXIAN". THE PLAYER IS FACED WITH A SWARM OF GALAXIANS, WHICH CONTINUALLY DIVE-BOMB AND SHOWER THE PLAYER WITH DEADLY PROJECTILES. TO ADVANCE TO THE NEXT MISSION, THE PLAYER MUST DESTROY ALL THE GALAXIANS. 
MISSION 4 - SPACE WARP: A WORMHOLE IS SITUATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN OUT OF WHICH ENEMIES SHIPS EMERGE, ONE AT A TIME, AND SPIRAL OUTWARD AT INCREASING SPEED; WHILST GROWING LARGER AND FLINGING FIREBALLS AT THE PLAYER. THE SPACE WARP LEVEL WOULD HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON KONAMI'S SUPERB "GYRUSS", RELEASED TWO YEARS LATER. TO ADVANCE TO THE NEXT MISSION, THE PLAYER MUST SURVIVE A NUMBER OF THESE ENEMIES. 
MISSION 5, FLAG SHIP: THE FINAL MISSION IS A ONE-ON-ONE CONFRONTATION WITH THE ALIEN FLAG SHIP ITSELF. THE FLAG SHIP IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST EXAMPLES OF THE 'BOSS' ENEMY IN MAINSTREAM VIDEO GAMES. IT IS EQUIPPED WITH ITS OWN FORCE FIELD, THROUGH WHICH THE PLAYER MUST BLAST IN ORDER TO GET A CLEAN SHOT ON THE SHIP. IT IS ALSO ARMED WITH A POWERFUL FIREBALL WEAPON. THE PLAYER'S WEAPON HAS A MINOR EFFECT ON THE FLAG SHIP'S HULL, AND CAN ONLY BLAST OFF TINY PIECES OF IT. THIS ADDS TO THE PLAYER'S PROBLEMS, AS STRAY PIECES OF HULL CAN DESTROY THEIR SHIP. THESE PIECES CAN BE DESTROYED WITH A SINGLE SHOT. THE ONLY WAY TO DESTROY THE FLAG SHIP IS TO HIT THE GLOWING REACTOR AT THE HEART OF THE SHIP, EITHER BY FIRST BLASTING AWAY THE HULL TO EXPOSE IT, OR BY MANAGING TO FIRE A SHOT DIRECTLY INTO THE TINY VENT THAT LEADS TO THE REACTOR. 

EACH TIME THE FLAG SHIP IS DESTROYED, THE PLAYER ADVANCES IN RANK. INITIALLY, THE PLAYER BEGINS WITH THE RANK OF SPACE CADET, BEFORE MOVING ON TO SPACE CAPTAIN, SPACE COLONEL, SPACE GENERAL, SPACE WARRIOR, AND FINALLY SPACE AVENGER. THE PLAYER'S SPACESHIP IS EQUIPPED WITH A QUARK LASER WHICH ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO CANCEL A POORLY AIMED SHOT AND FIRE ANOTHER SHOT.</desc>

		<desc>IN THE DARKEST REACHES OF INFINITE SPACE, PURE EVIL LIES IN WAIT ... THE DARK FORCES LED BY THE GOD OF DESTRUCTION, BACTERIAN, PREPARE TO LAUNCH A MASSIVE ONSLAUGHT AGAINST THE PLANET GRADIUS. POSSESSING UNSTOPPABLE POWER, THE DARK FORCES THREATEN TO PLUNGE THE UNIVERSE INTO TOTAL WAR AND COMPLETE ANNIHILATION.

THEIR INVASION FORCE SMASHES THE GRADIUS DEFENSES, AND THE SURROUNDING PLANETS SOON FALL LIKE DOMINOES. NOW BACTERIAN'S EVIL GRASP REACHES FOR THE HEART OF THE RESISTANCE...PLANET GRADIUS ITSELF...

TO COUNTER THE ONCOMING THREAT THE UNITED GRADIUS WORLD FORCES GATHER ALL THEIR FIGHTER CRAFT. HALF OF THEM FORM A DEFENSIVE NET - THE OTHER HALF A STRIKE TEAM. BUT THEY ARE BADLY OUTNUMBERED AND THE DARK FORCES EASILY TEAR THROUGH THEIR THIN FRONTLINE. NO FIGHTERS SURVIVE THE SLAUGHTER....

IN A LAST GASP MOVE, THE UNITED GRADIUS WORLD FORCES SEND OUT TWO FIGHTERS, PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED TOO DANGEROUS FOR COMBAT MISSIONS: THE INTERDIMENSIONAL VIC VIPER FIGHTERS.

THE FIGHTERS TAKE OFF FOR THE HEART OF DARKNESS TO JOIN THE FRAY THAT WILL DECIDE THE FATE OF THE UNIVERSE...</desc>

		<desc>GRADIUS / NEMESIS IS A HORIZONTALLY-SCROLLING SHOOT-EM-UP IN WHICH THE PLAYER PILOTS A SPACECRAFT KNOWN AS THE VIC VIPER AS THEY SEARCH THROUGH UNEXPLORED GALAXIES LOOKING FOR A LOST ARMADA. THESE NEW GALAXIES ARE TEAMING WITH ALIEN LIFE SET UPON DESTROYING THE VIPER. 

THE GAME FEATURES A POWER-UP SYSTEM BASED ON A SELECTION METER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN CALLED A 'POWER METER', THIS ALLOWS PLAYERS TO 'BUY' WEAPONS AND UPGRADES. TO ACHIEVE THIS, PLAYERS MUST DESTROY SPECIAL INDIVIDUAL ENEMIES - USUALLY RED IN COLOUR - OR ENEMY WAVES THAT THEN DROP ORANGE CAPSULES. THESE CAPSULES CAN BE COLLECTED AND USED TO UPGRADE THE VIPER'S WEAPONS. EACH COLLECTED CAPSULE ADVANCES THE POWER METER BY ONE STEP. PLAYERS CAN ACTIVATE THE HIGHLIGHTED ITEM AT ANY POINT, AFTER WHICH THE POWER METER RESETS.</desc>

		<desc>GRAVITAR IS A 1- OR 2-PLAYER GAME WITH A COLOR X-Y VIDEO DISPLAY. THIS NEW DISPLAY, WITH ITS THREE COLOR GUNS AND HIGHER VOLTAGE, HAS THE SAME TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS USED IN PREVIOUS ATARI BLACK-AND-WHITE X-Y DISPLAYS. HOWEVER, THE SCREEN NOW DISPLAYS DAZZLING COLORS AND UNIQUE VISUAL EFFECTS. 

THE PLAYER CONTROLS A SPACE SHIP IN THREE DIFFERENT SOLAR SYSTEMS. EACH SOLAR SYSTEM CONSISTS OF A HOME BASE, A DEATH STAR, A RED ALIEN PLANET AND FOUR REGULAR PLANETS. EACH PLANET HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE TERRAIN. 

THE RED ALIEN PLANET IS THE HOME OF SHOOTING ALIEN SHIPS. SOME OF THE REGULAR PLANETS MAY HAVE FLYING ALIEN RAMMERS TO BE AVOIDED OR SHOT DOWN. THE FOUR PLANETS ALL HAVE FUEL CELLS TO BE RETRIEVED WITH A TRACTOR BEAM AND ALIEN BUNKERS THAT FIRE SHELLS. SUCCESSFULLY DESTROYING ALL OF THE BUNKERS RESULTS IN A 'MISSION COMPLETE' MESSAGE AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. ACHIEVING 'MISSION COMPLETE' ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO COLLECT BONUS IF HE CAN EVADE THE RAMMERS WHEN LEAVING THE PLANET. IF SUCCESSFUL, HE WILL BE PLACED BACK IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 

A PLAYER HAS TWO WAYS TO ADVANCE TO THE NEXT SOLAR SYSTEM. THE FIRST IS TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE A MISSION ON ALL FOUR REGULAR PLANETS. THE SECOND WAY IS TO COMPLETE A MISSION ON THE RED ALIEN PLANET, WHICH ESTABLISHES A LINK INTO THE NEXT SOLAR SYSTEM.</desc>

		<desc>GREEN BERET IS A SIDEWAYS-SCROLLING ACTION/PLATFORM GAME SET DURING THE COLD WAR, IN WHICH A US SPECIAL FORCES MARINE MUST INFILTRATE A RUSSIAN MILITARY BASE TO SAVE FOUR POW'S FROM BEING EXECUTED BY FIRING SQUAD. 

INITIALLY, THE SOLDIER IS ARMED WITH ONLY A COMBAT KNIFE, BUT BY KILLING THE CERTAIN ENEMY TROOPS, PLAYERS CAN OBTAIN EITHER A THREE-SHOT FLAMETHROWER, A FOUR-SHOT RPG, OR A THREE-PACK OF HAND GRENADES. 

THE MARINE CAN JUMP OR LIE DOWN TO AVOID THE ENEMY BULLETS, AS WELL AS CLIMBING LADDERS TO AVOID ENEMIES AND PROJECTILES, AS WELL AS THE FLASHING LAND MINES THAT LITTER THE LEVELS. WHILE IT'S POSSIBLE TO REMAIN STILL IN ONE AREA TO RACK UP POINTS, IF PLAYERS TAKE TOO LONG TO PROCEED, THE GAME WILL START SENDING OUT TOUGHER ENEMIES AND EVENTUALLY A STEALTH-LIKE BOMBER WILL APPEAR TO TAKE OUT THE PLAYER. THERE IS ALSO AN UNSEEN TIME LIMIT THAT WILL KILL OFF PLAYERS IF THEY TAKE TOO LONG TO COMPLETE THE STAGE. 

THE GAME HAS FOUR STAGES IN TOTAL: A MISSILE BASE, A HARBOUR, AN AIR BASE AND A SIBERIAN POW CAMP. AT THE END OF EACH STAGE THE MARINE WILL FACE A GROUP OF ENEMIES SPECIFIC TO THAT STAGE: STAGE 1 ENDS WITH A TRUCKLOAD OF RUNNING AND JUMP-KICKING SOLDIERS, STAGE 2 WITH A PACK OF FIERCE DOGS AND THEIR HANDLERS, STAGE 3 WITH THREE GYRO-COPTERS AND STAGE 4 WITH A NUMBER OF MULTI-SHOT FLAMETHROWER OPERATORS. 

THE GAME IS COMPLETED ONCE THE CAPTIVES HAVE BEEN RESCUED AT THE END OF THE FOURTH STAGE, AFTER WHICH THE ACTION STARTS OVER WITH AN INCREASED LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY.</desc>

THE EARLY HALF OF THE 90'S, THE PERSIAN GULF WAR BREAKS OUT IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND PROLONGED FIGHTING RAPIDLY INCREASES THE RATE OF DESTRUCTION OF THE WORLD'S NATURAL RESOURCES. IN 1999 THIS DEVELOPS INTO A STATE OF CRISIS WHERE THE EFFECTS OF THE WAR HAVE RESULTED IN AN ABSOLUTE SHORTAGE OF RESERVES. MISTAKEN POLICIES HAVE RESULTED IN THE NATION OF THE MIDDLE EAST, SUFFERING FROM SHORTAGES SINCE THE TIME OF THE ORIGINAL PERSIAN GULF WAR, TAKING MILITARY ACTION AGAINST NEIGHBORING NATIONS IN AN ATTEMPT TO ASSURE A SUPPLY OF RESOURCES FOR THEMSELVES. THOSE NATIONS WHICH HAVE MANAGED TO ESCAPE THE FIGHTING ONCE AGAIN FORM A MULTINATIONAL FORCE. USING THE TECHNOLOGY GAINED FROM RESEARCH WHICH HAD BEEN DONE FOR A NEW TYPE OF NUCLEAR REACTOR, THEY SUCCEED IN DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING GRID - A GYRODRIVE REACTIVE INTERCEPT DEVICE.

SHOOTING ENEMIES ALSO AWARDS THE PLAYER POINTS, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE ONLY WAY TO PASS A LEVEL IS TO SHOOT EVERY ENEMY. THE PLAYER KNOWS WHEN THE ENEMY IS OVERHEAD BY LOOKING AT HIS SHADOW ON THE GRID. EACH RED BALL IS WORTH 100 POINTS. THE GREEN BALL APPEARS AFTER CATCHING 3 RED BALLS &amp; ISWORTH 500 POINTS. THE CRYSTAL APPEARS AFTER CATCHING 3 RED BALLS, A GREEN BALL AND 3 MORE RED BALLS. IT IS WORTH 1000 POINTS AND MUST BE CAUGHT BEFORE IT LANDS SINCE IT WILL NOT BOUNCE, BUT INSTEAD DISAPPEAR. THE GREEN BALLS BOUNCE VERY HIGH AND CAN BOUNCE FAR, MAKING THEM HARD TO CATCH. THE PLAYER HAS TO AVOID TOUCHING THE BOUNCING ENEMIES, THE CHARGED TILES THAT FLASH AFTER ENEMIES LAND ON THEM, AND THE WORM THAT MOVES HORIZONTALLY ACROSS THE TILES WHILE CHARGING THEM. THERE IS A CHARACTER NAMED IGOR THAT SPITS A STICKY GUM-LIKE SUBSTANCE, WHICH TURNS THE TILE IT LANDS ON PINK AND CAUSES GRIDLEE TO MOVE SLOW WHEN WALKING ON THAT TILE. ALSO, IF THERE'S ONE ENEMY LEFT BOUNCING FOR A WHILE AS THE PLAYER CATCHES THE
BALLS, THE ENEMY EVENTUALLY CHARGES TILE AFTER TILE, WHICH MAKES IT DANGEROUS FOR THE PLAYER AS THE WALKING SPACE IS LIMITED.</desc>

		<desc>THE COUNTRY IS STRUGGLING UNDER THE CRUEL DOMINATION OF ITS EVIL KING. THE REBEL GUERILLA LEADER AND HIS COMRADES ATTEMPT TO SECRETLY LAND ON SHORE. THE KING'S MILITARY IS WAITING FOR THEM, HOWEVER, AND THE PLAYERS MUST FIGHT THEIR WAY INLAND TO REACH AND DESTROY THE KING'S PALACE STRONGHOLD.

IN THIS, THE PSEUDO-SEQUEL TO SNK'S OWN SUPERB "IKARI WARRIORS" (RELEASED TWO YEARS EARLIER), PLAYERS MUST ONCE AGAIN SHOOT THEIR WAY THROUGH A NUMBER OF VERTICALLY SCROLLING LEVELS, ALL PACKED WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF ENEMY SOLDIERS, GUN EMPLACEMENTS AND VEHICLES. EACH LEVEL ALSO CONTAINS A NUMBER OF CAPTURED PRISONERS TIED TO WOODEN STAKES, AND THESE CAN BE RESCUED FOR EXTRA POINTS. 

THE PLAYERS' WEAPONS HAVE ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION AND ADDITIONAL AMMO/GRENADES MUST BE PICKED UP ALONG THE WAY. A NUMBER OF GUN UPGRADES CAN ALSO BE FOUND. AT VARIOUS POINTS IN THE GAME, PLAYERS CAN ALSO ENTER UNOCCUPIED ENEMY TANKS, WHICH PROVIDE INCREASED FIREPOWER AS WELL AS RESISTANCE TO ENEMY SHOTS. TOO MANY ENEMY HITS, HOWEVER, WILL EVENTUALLY SEE THE TANK EXPLODE - THIS IS PROCEEDED BY A WARNING FLASH TO ALLOW THE PLAYER TO EXIT THE TANK BEFORE THE EXPLOSION OCCURS. SHOULD THE PLAYER BE CAUGHT INSIDE OR NEAR THE TANK WHEN IT EXPLODES, A LIFE IS LOST.

AS WITH "IKARI WARRIORS", GUERRILLA WAR FEATURES FULL 360 DEGREE GAMEPLAY WITH ATTACKING TROOPS APPEARING FROM ALL DIRECTIONS. THE PLAYERS' ON-SCREEN COUNTERPARTS ARE ABLE TO ROTATE THEMSELVES ACCORDINGLY.</desc>

LIKE MANY GAME FROM KOREA, COMAD USED THE GULF WAR THEME IN THE 90'S. THIS WAS A GREAT THEME, BECAUSE BASED ON THE ACTUALITY, AND THE GAME SOLD VERY WELL (HUNDRED THOUSAND OF BOARDS)</desc>

		<desc>THE YEAR IS 2120: EARTHLINGS HAVE SPREAD BEYOND THEIR GALAXY AND HAVE STARTED TO COLONIZE UNINHABITED PLANETS IN DIFFERENT SOLAR SYSTEMS. ONE SUCH PLANET TO BE COLONIZED WAS THE EARTH-LIKE PLANET GLORIA WHICH HAPPENED TO HAVE AN ENORMOUS NATURAL SUPPLY OF GOLD. THIS DISCOVERY BECAME PIVOTAL TO GLORIA'S EMIGRATION, SO MUCH THAT EMIGRATORS WOULD BE IMPOVERISHED BY THE COST OF REACHING THE PLANET. BECAUSE OF THIS, LIFE ON THE PLANET THRIVED IN A SETTING SIMILAR TO THE AMERICAN OLD WEST. THOUGH POOR, THE GOLD TRADE AIDED THE GLORIAN'S IN ADVANCING TECHNOLOGY AND KNOWLEDGE, SO MUCH THAT AMONG THE INHABITANTS LIVED TALENTED INVENTORS AND ENGINEERS.

HOWEVER, THE GLORIAN'S WERE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO WERE TEMPTED BY THE PLANET'S GOLD: SPACE PIRATES KNOWN AS THE WILD LIZARDS QUICKLY INVADE GLORIA AND DECIMATE THE TOWNS OF THE PEOPLE AND ENSLAVE THOSE WHO SURVIVED IN AN ATTEMPT TO DEPLETE THE PLANET'S GOLD SUPPLY. TWO INVENTORS OF GLORIA WHO WERE A PART OF THE PLANET'S DEVELOPMENT TEAMS DECIDE TO STRIKE BACK AT THEIR INVADERS USING TWO FIGHTER JETS IN THE SHAPE OF GIANT REVOLVERS WITH PLANE WINGS.

AS FAR AS VERTICAL SCROLLING SHOOTERS GO, GUN FRONTIER IS VERY STANDARD. PLAYERS START WITH DUAL MACHINE GUNS WHICH ARE STRENGTHENED AND MULTIPLIED BY UPGRADES THAT COME IN THE SHAPE OF US DIMES TAKEN FROM BUFFALO SHAPED ENEMIES AND EVERY FIVE DIMES EMPOWERS THE SHIP'S GUNS. PLAYERS ALSO START WITH A BOMB SUPPLY WHICH IS UPGRADED TO FURTHER DESTRUCTION BY COLLECTING GOLD BARS FROM DESTROYED GROUND FORCES. ONCE A PLAYER ACCUMULATES 25 BOMBS, THEY ARE GRANTED ACCESS TO THE BOMBER MAX, THE STRONGEST OF THE PLAYER'S BOMBS.

THE PLAYERS CAN ALSO PICK UP SPINNING COINS WITH TWO DIFFERENT SIDES: A SILVER SIDE AND A GOLD SIDE. IF THE PLAYER COLLECTS THE COIN ON THE SILVER SIDE, THEN THE PLAYER MERELY GAINS ANOTHER COIN FOR THEIR GUNS. HOWEVER, IF THE PLAYER COLLECTS THE COIN ON THE GOLD SIDE, THEN THE PLAYER'S GUNS AND BOMB SUPPLY IS MAXIMIZED TO FULL POWER.

A UNIQUE FEATURE TO THE PLAYER'S BOMBS IS THAT THE DIRECTION OF THE BOMB'S BLAST CAN BE DETERMINED BY THE PLAYER'S MOVEMENT. IF THE PLAYER MOVES THEIR PLANE TO THE LOWER RIGHT OF THE SCREEN AND LAUNCHES THEIR BOMBS, THEN THE DIRECTION THE BOMB WILL TRAVEL IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THE PLANE'S MOVEMENT. THIS FEATURE CAN ONLY BE USED HOWEVER WHEN A PLAYER HAS A LARGE BOMB COUNT AS ONLY HAVING ONE OR TWO BOMBS WILL RESULT IN A SMALL DIRECTIONLESS EXPLOSION. LIKE MOST BOMBS IN SHOOT 'EM UPS, THE BOMBS ALSO WORK AS A SHIELD AGAINST ENEMY FIRE.

THE GAME USES A CHECK-POINT SYSTEM IN WHICH A DOWNED SINGLE PLAYER WILL START OFF AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CHECK-POINT THEY DIED AT.

GUN FRONTIER ALSO EMPLOYS AN ANTI-AUTOFIRE MECHANISM WHERE THE DIFFICULTY WILL MAX OUT BY THE SECOND STAGE IF THE PLAYER IS SUSTAINING TOO FAST OF A FIRE RATE.</desc>

YOUR ONLY GOAL IS TO SHOOT THE OTHER PLAYER, WHO IS RIGHT ACROSS THE SCREEN FROM YOU; HE WILL THEN FALL DOWN AND SAY 'GOT ME'.

EACH LEVEL IS PACKED WITH GUN-TOTING BANDITS AND THE SHERIFF MUST SHOOT HIS WAY THROUGH THE STAGE, BEFORE FINALLY TAKING ON THE WANTED OUTLAW 'BOSS' CHARACTER AT THE END. EACH OUTLAW WIELDS A SPECIAL WEAPON UNIQUE TO THEM, SUCH AS A WINCHESTER RIFLE, KNIVES, DARTS OR BOOMERANGS.

SHOOTING THE BARRELS THAT LITTER THE LEVELS REVEALS POWER-UPS SUCH AS BOOTS (FOR EXTRA SPEED), RIFLES (FOR INCREASED RANGE) AND BULLETS (FOR RAPID FIRE). THE GAME'S 3 DIRECTIONAL FIRE BUTTONS (FOR FIRING LEFT, RIGHT OR AHEAD) CAN BE COMBINED (PRESSED SIMULTANEOUSLY) TO CREATE A TOTAL OF 8 DIFFERENT FIRING DIRECTIONS.</desc>

		<desc>GUNBIRD IS A VERTICALLY SCROLLING SHOOT 'EM UP DEVELOPED AND PUBLISHED BY PSIKYO AND RELEASED IN JAPANESE ARCADES IN 1994. IT HAS BEEN RE-RELEASED MULTIPLE TIMES, INCLUDING ON THE SEGA SATURN, PLAYSTATION, AND STEAM. WHEN ORIGINALLY LOCALIZED OUTSIDE JAPAN BY XS GAMES, GUNBIRD WAS RETITLED MOBILE LIGHT FORCE. THE GAME WAS FOLLOWED BY GUNBIRD 2 IN 1998 AND WAS INCLUDED IN GUNBIRD SPECIAL EDITION.

WHEN A PLAYER COLLIDES WITH THE BODY OF AN ENEMY UNIT, THE PLAYER LOSES A SHOT POWER LEVEL, AND A POWER UP FLIES AROUND THE SCREEN AND DISAPPEARS AS SOON AS IT REACHES THE EDGE. IF A PLAYER IS AT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF SHOT, THE PLAYER LOSES A BOMB INSTEAD.
THERE ARE SEVEN STAGES IN EACH OF THE GAME'S TWO LOOPS. THE FIRST FOUR STAGES ARE RANDOMLY CHOSEN FROM POSSIBLE FIVE. IN THE SECOND LOOP ENEMIES FIRE DENSER BULLET PATTERNS MOVING AT FASTER SPEEDS. STAGE 2-1 TAKES PLACE AT THE ONLY STAGE NOT AVAILABLE ON THE FIRST LOOP, INSTEAD OF THE 1-1 COUNTERPART. THE REMAINING THREE STAGES ARE CHOSEN AT RANDOM, BUT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE REPLACED STAGE. AFTER COMPLETING FIRST LOOP WITH ONLY ONE PLAYER, THE PLAYER CAN CHOOSE ONE OF TWO CHOICES FOR A WISH WITH A MAGIC POTION, WITH UNIQUE ENDINGS FOR EACH CHOICE. IF THE FIRST LOOP IS COMPLETED WITH TWO PLAYERS, A COMBINATION-SPECIFIC ENDING IS PLAYED.
THE CUTSCENES BETWEEN THE BATTLES WITH TWO PLAYERS FIGHTING COOPERATIVELY ARE FREQUENTLY PACKED WITH HILARIOUS DIALOGUE AND SITUATIONS. THIS IS OFTEN A RECURRING THEME WITH PSIKYO GAMES, THE GUNBIRD GAMES BEING NO EXCEPTION. THERE ARE NO CUTSCENES WHEN PLAYING SECOND LOOP STAGES. THE KOREAN ARCADE VERSION CONTAINS ENGLISH DIALOG BUT SOME SOUND SAMPLES ARE MISSING DURING PLAY.

GUNBIRD USES MANGA-STYLED CHARACTER AS THE PLAYER'S CHOSEN CRAFT. A STORY PLAYS OUT IN BETWEEN LEVELS AND BEFORE BOSS FIGHTS, TELLING A TALE OF HOW THE PROTAGONISTS ARE TRYING TO COLLECT PIECES OF A MAGIC MIRROR TO MAKE A WISH.
ASH: A 28-YEAR-OLD GERMAN MAN WITH A JET PACK ON HIS BACK, WHO IN SOME OF THE SCENES BETWEEN BATTLES IS DISCOVERED TO BE AN INVENTOR, AND WHEN TWO PLAYERS CHOOSE MARION AND ASH AS COOPERATIVE PARTNERS, HE TAKES AN UNHEALTHY INTEREST IN HER. VOICED BY RY?TAR? OKIAYU.
MARION: A 13-YEAR-OLD WITCH FROM ENGLAND WHO FLIES ON A BROOMSTICK. SHE IS ACCOMPANIED BY HER TALKING PET RABBIT, POM-POM, AND FREQUENTLY ABUSES THE POOR CREATURE VERBALLY AND PHYSICALLY. MARION IS FUN-LOVING AND THRILL-SEEKING BUT ALSO SELFISH, AND HAS A MEAN STREAK (WHICH POM-POM IS OFTEN WITNESS TO). VOICED BY CHIHARU TANAKA.
VALNUS: A BIG ROBOT CREATED IN RUSSIA SIX MONTHS AGO THAT HAS SOME OF THE BEST FIREPOWER IN THE GAME. SECRETLY WISHES TO BE HUMAN. VOICED BY KAZUYA TATEKABE.
YUAN NANG: A STRONG-WILLED AND COURAGEOUS WOMAN WHOSE CHARACTER DESIGN IS HIGHLY INFLUENCED BY THAT OF SUN WUKONG FROM THE CHINESE CLASSICAL STORY JOURNEY TO THE WEST, INCLUDING A CLOUD-SOMERSAULT PARODY, RUYI JINGU BANG, AND THE SIZE-CHANGING HEADBAND THAT WAS USED BY THE MONK XUÁNZÀNG. VOICED BY NAOKO MATSUI.
TETSU: A STRONG, WHITE-HAIRED OLD MAN OF 60 YEARS. HE IS HOMOSEXUAL IN A RATHER UNCLOSETED MANNER AND RIDES IN A MAN-POWERED HELICOPTER. VOICED BY SAKUNOSUKE MAYA.
THE TRUMP: A GROUP OF SKY PIRATES CONSIST OF ACE (VOICED BY J?JI YANAMI), CLAUDE (VOICED BY KAZUYA TATEKABE), AND THEIR FEMALE LEADER ROUGE (VOICED BY NORIKO OHARA). THEY ARE NOT PLAYABLE AND SERVE AS THE PLAYERS' RIVALS IN THE STORY.</desc>

WHEN EMPTY THE CHARACTER IS A SHELL OF A SPRITE, BUT CAN MOVE MORE QUICKLY. LIQUID IS REPLENISHED BY DRINKING (GUZZLING) FROM PUDDLES.

		<desc>GYRUSS IS A SINGLE-PLAYER SHOOT-EM-UP IN WHICH THE PURPOSE IS TO FLY THROUGH THE SOLAR SYSTEM, DESTROYING WAVES OF ALIEN ATTACKERS, BEFORE FINALLY REACHING EARTH. PLANETS THAT MUST BE PASSED BEFORE EARTH IS REACHED ARE NEPTUNE, URANUS, SATURN, JUPITER, AND MARS. 

IT ONLY TAKES TWO WARPS TO REACH NEPTUNE, BUT ALL OF THE OTHERS, INCLUDING EARTH, TAKE THREE WARPS TO GET TO. EACH TIME THE PLAYER REACHES A PLANET, THEY WILL BE FACED WITH A 'CHANCE STAGE', A BONUS STAGE IN WHICH PLAYERS TRY TO DESTROY AS MANY ALIENS AS POSSIBLE TO ACCRUE POINTS. AFTER REACHING EARTH, THERE IS A CHANCE STAGE, FOLLOWED BY A VERY FAST '3 WARPS TO NEPTUNE' STAGE. AFTER THIS, THE LEVELS AND THE BACKGROUND MUSIC START OVER. 

GYRUSS' SUPERB GAMEPLAY, IN WHICH THE PLAYER SHIP ROTATES AROUND THE EDGES OF THE SCREEN AND FIRES 'INWARDS', IS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY ATARI'S 1981 CLASSIC, "TEMPEST". WHILE THE DESIGN OF THE ALIEN SHIPS THEMSELVES IS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF NAMCO'S ALSO-LEGENDARY "GALAGA" SERIES.</desc>

		<desc>SLIDE INTO THE CONTOURED SEAT AND ADJUST IT TO FIT THE LENGTH OF YOUR ARMS AND LEGS. PUT YOUR FEET ON GAS AND CLUTCH PEDALS AND TRY THE STICK SHIFT. SELECT MANUAL OR AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION, TURN THE IGNITION KEY AND YOU'RE OFF!

ITÂS THE RIDE OF YOUR LIFE. YOU FEEL THE TIRES GRIP THE ROAD WHEN YOU TAKE A WIDE TURN AT HIGH SPEED. YOU'RE ALERTED TO THE SMALLEST CHANGE IN THE ROAD BY THE FEEDBACK STEERING. YOU CATCH AIR AS YOU FLY THE DRAW BRIDGE AND LAND ON THE DOWN RAMP. YOU CONTROL THE CAR AS IT HOLDS THE ROAD ON THE DIZZYING VERTICAL LOOP.

HARD DRIVIN' MIGHT LOOK LIKE AN ARCADE GAME BUT IT DRIVES LIKE A REAL CAR. FOR THE BEST LAP TIMES, DRIVE HARD DRIVIN' AS IF IT WERE A REAL CAR. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HARD DRIVIN' AND A REAL CAR IS THAT HARD DRIVIN' IS MUCH SAFER TO DRIVE. A PLAYER CAN TEST THE LIMITS OF THE CAR AND HIS SKILL WITH NO RISK OF PERSONAL INJURY, AND FOLLOW A COURSE THAT DOES NOT EXIST ANYWHERE IN THE REAL WORLD.

AFTER INSERTING THE PROPER NUMBER OF COINS TO START THE SIMULATOR, THE PLAYER CAN SELECT EITHER AN AUTOMATIC OR MANUAL TRANSMISSION. TURNING THE IGNITION KEY STARTS THE SIMULATOR.

DRIVERS CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN THE STUNT TRACK OR THE SPEED TRACK BY FOLLOWING THE POSTED SIGNS ON THE ROAD. EACH PLAYER HAS A CERTAIN (OPERATOR-SELECTABLE) AMOUNT OF TIME TO REACH A CHECKPOINT OR THE FINISH LINE. CROSSING CHECKPOINTS AND THE FINISH LINE REWARDS THE PLAYER WITH (OPERATOR-SELECTABLE) BONUS DRIVING TIME.

WITH HARD DRIVIN' A PLAYER CAN TEST DRIVE A HIGH-POWERED SPORTS CAR ON A REAL STUNT COURSE. HE CAN JUMP A DRAW BRIDGE, NEGOTIATE A HIGH-SPEED BANKED TURN AND DRIVE A 360-DEGREE VERTICAL LOOP. THESE THRILLING STUNTS, AMONG OTHERS, PROVIDE THE ULTIMATE REALISTIC DRIVING EXPERIENCE.

OR MAYBE HIGH-SPEED DRIVING IS A PARTICULAR PLAYER'S TYPE OF EXCITEMENT. HE CAN 'PUT THE PEDAL TO THE METAL' AND TRY TO KEEP CONTROL AROUND THE CORNERS, WEAVING IN AND OUT OF TRAFFIC WHILE AVOIDING ONCOMING CARS. ALL THIS, AND MORE, AWAIT THE PLAYER BEHIND THE WHEEL OF HARD DRIVIN'.

PLAYERS ESPECIALLY ENJOY THE UNIQUE INSTANT REPLAY FEATURE ON HARD DRIVIN'.  EVERY TIME A PLAYER CRASHES, THE SIMULATOR RECORDS AND REPLAYS THE CRASH SEQUENCE. NOT ONLY WILL THE PLAYER FIND THIS ENTERTAINING, BUT IT IS ALSO INFORMATIVE. THE INSTANT REPLAY SHOWS THE PLAYER EXACTLY WHAT HE DID WRONG AND WHY HE CRASHED (IF A PLAYER WANTS TO SKIP THE INSTANT REPLAY, HE CAN PRESS THE ABORT SWITCH OR TURN THE KEY WHEN THE REPLAY STARTS).

A SKILLED PLAYER FINDS THE ULTIMATE COMPETITION IN THE 'CHALLENGE' LAP (OR 'GRUDGE MATCH' AS ATARI GAMES LIKES TO CALL IT). THE SIMULATOR REMEMBERS THE PATH OF THE CAR DRIVEN BY THE BEST DRIVER ON RECORD.  WHEN A PLAYER BEATS THE QUALIFYING LAP TIME, HE CHALLENGES THE CAR OF THE PAST WINNER IN A HEAD-TO-HEAD RACE.</desc>

		<name>Heavy Barrel</name>
		<desc>HEAVY BARREL IS A 1987 OVERHEAD RUN AND GUN ARCADE GAME BY DATA EAST.

TERRORISTS HAVE SEIZED THE UNDERGROUND CONTROL COMPLEX OF A NUCLEAR MISSILE SITE, AND IT IS UP TO THE PLAYER TO INFILTRATE THE BASE AND KILL THE ENEMY LEADER. PLAYERS BEGIN ARMED WITH A LASER GUN WITH UNLIMITED AMMUNITION AND A LIMITED SUPPLY OF GRENADES. IMPROVED WEAPONS AND GRENADE POWERUPS ARE MADE AVAILABLE WITHIN THE GAME, EITHER IN PLAIN SIGHT OR WITHIN CRATES THAT MUST BE UNLOCKED USING KEYS. ADDITIONALLY, CRATES MAY CONTAIN ORBS OR ONE OF THE SIX PIECES OF THE HEAVY BARREL SUPERWEAPON. LIKE SNK'S IKARI WARRIORS, THE ORIGINAL ARCADE VERSION FEATURED 8-WAY ROTARY JOYSTICKS.
THE NAME OF THE GAME IS FROM AN IN-GAME WEAPON. THE HEAVY BARREL IS FOUND IN SIX PIECES AND IS AN ENERGY CANNON CAPABLE OF DESTROYING ANY ENEMY IN THE GAME WITH A SINGLE SHOT (EXCEPT THE FINAL ENEMY, AND POSSIBLY ONE OTHER BOSS THAT MAY HAVE REQUIRED TWO SHOTS). THE WEAPON HAS A WIDE ARC OF FIRE AND CAN BE FIRED AS FAST AS THE PLAYER'S TRIGGER FINGER PERMITS, BUT AFTER THIRTY SECONDS ITS USE IS EXHAUSTED, AT WHICH POINT THE BEARER REVERTS TO HIS PREVIOUS WEAPONRY. BEST USED TO GET PAST TOUGH BOSSES, THE WEAPON COULD BE BUILT SEVERAL TIMES IN A SINGLE GAME (PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR TIMES). IN A TWO-PLAYER GAME, WHOEVER COLLECTS THE SIXTH PIECE IS EQUIPPED WITH THE HEAVY BARREL.</desc>

HIS OBJECTIVE IS TO COLLECT THE NUMBERED BOXES ON EACH ROUND IN NUMERICAL ORDER (THE ONE HE SHOULD COLLECT NEXT WILL FLASH), THEN DROP THEM ONTO ONE OF THE TWO CONVEYOR BELTS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. THERE ARE SEVERAL KINDS OF ENEMY ROBOTS THAT GUARD SOME OF THE BOXES; THEY ALL MOVE IN PRESET PATTERNS AND YOU WILL HAVE TO LEARN THEIR MOVEMENTS IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST MOMENT TO SNEAK PAST THEM. IF ANY OF THEM TOUCH HOPPER ROBO HE WILL DIE. HE MUST ALSO AVOID OTHER OBSTACLES SUCH AS FLYING HAMMERS AND SPRINGS. TO AID HOPPER ROBO, THERE ARE SPRINGBOARDS TO REACH HIGHER PLATFORMS, AND PIPES TO SLIDE BACK DOWN. IF HOPPER ROBO SHOULD RUN OUT OF ENERGY, IT WILL COST HIM A LIFE - BUT WHEN HE CLEARS A ROUND, HIS REMAINING ENERGY WILL BE AWARDED TO THE PLAYER, AS BONUS POINTS. THERE ARE EIGHT UNIQUE LEVELS, AFTER WHICH THE GAME LOOPS INDEFINITELY.</desc>

THE PLAYER TAKES THE ROLE OF THE PILOT OF A FUTURISTIC SPACE FIGHTER, WAGING WAR AGAINST A HORDE OF GIANT ROBOTS, TANKS, MECHS, AND MASSIVE GUNSHIPS. SIMILAR TO GAMES LIKE STRIKERS 1945 OR RAIDEN, ENEMIES OFTEN ATTACK WITH EXTREMELY FAST VOLLEYS OF PROJECTILES, IN CONTRAST TO PROTO-BULLET HELL GAMES SUCH AS DONPACHI THAT STARTED APPEARING THE PREVIOUS YEAR.
THE GAME HAS FIVE STAGES, EACH ENDING IN A BOSS FIGHT. BOSSES HAVE DESTRUCTIBLE PARTS THAT CAN BE BLOWN APART PIECE BY PIECE FOR MORE POINTS, AND EACH BOSS ALSO HAS A TELEGRAPHED SUPER WEAPON THAT FIRES PERIODICALLY AND MUST BE AVOIDED.

		<desc>HUNCHBACK IS A CLASSIC AND MUCH-COPIED PLATFORM GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYER TAKES ON THE ROLE OF THE EPONYMOUS BELL-RINGER, QUASIMODO, IN HIS QUEST TO RESCUE THE BEAUTIFUL ESMERALDA FROM THE TOWER OF THE CASTLE FORTRESS.

TO REACH ESMERALDA, QUASI MUST RUN AND JUMP THROUGH A NUMBER OF SCREENS - EACH REPRESENTING PART OF A CASTLE WALL - TO REACH THE TOWER AND COMPLETE HIS RESCUE. EACH SCREEN PRESENTS THE PLAYER WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF PLATFORM-BASED OBSTACLES. THESE RANGE FROM SPEAR-TOTING GUARDS, TO RAMPARTS AND FIERY CHASMS (THE LATTER OF WHICH IS CLEARED BY CAREFULLY TIMED JUMPS ONTO AND OFF A CONSTANTLY SWINGING ROPE).

MOST OF THE GAME'S SCREENS ALSO FEATURE PROJECTILES - IN THE FORM OF FIREBALLS AND ARROWS - THAT MUST BE AVOIDED. THESE CAN APPEAR FROM BOTH THE LEFT AND RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND CAN BE MOVING AT ONE OF TWO DIFFERENT HEIGHTS AND SPEEDS. SOME OF THE TRICKIER SCREENS CONTAIN MORE THAN ONE OF THESE PROJECTILES AND CONTACT WITH EITHER A PROJECTILE OR GUARD WILL RESULT IN QUASI FALLING FROM THE CASTLE WALL, RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF A PLAYER LIFE.

TO COMPLICATE MATTERS FURTHER, EACH SCREEN MUST BE COMPLETED WITHIN A STRICT TIME LIMIT. THIS TAKES THE FORM OF AN ENEMY GUARD CLIMBING THE CASTLE WALLS; IF THE GUARD REACHES THE TOP OF THE WALL, HE WILL WALK TOWARDS QUASI TO BURN THE HUNCHBACK WITH HIS TORCH. IF QUASI RINGS THE BELL BEFORE THE GUARD HAS SCALED THE WALL, A BONUS SCORE IS REWARDED. IF FIVE SCREENS ARE COMPLETED WITHOUT A LIFE BEING LOST, A 'SUPER BONUS' IS AWARDED.

A METER AT THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER OF THE SCREEN - DISPLAYING A CUTAWAY OF CASTLE RAMPARTS - SHOWS QUASI'S PROGRESS TOWARDS THE TOWER AND HIS BELOVED ESMERALDA. UPON REACHING ESMERALDA, PLAYERS MUST COMPLETE A BONUS SCREEN - INVOLVING USING MOVING ROPES TO COLLECT BELLS FROM A SERIES OF PLATFORMS - TO COMPLETE THE RESCUE.

ONCE COMPLETED, THE GAME STARTS OVER WITH A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY AND TIGHTER TIME LIMITS.</desc>

		<name>Hustle</name>
		<desc>HUSTLE IS A 1- OR 2-PLAYER VIDEO GAME WHICH CHALLENGES PLAYERS' REACTION TIME AS THEY ATTEMPT TO BUILD UP A HIGH SCORE. THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO MANEUVER A MOVING ARROW INTO TARGETS WHICH APPEAR RANDOMLY ON THE SCREEN. EACH ARROW IS ACCOMPANIED BY A TAIL, WHICH CAN BE USED TO BLOCK THE OPPONENT FROM SCORING TARGETS.

TARGETS: THE TARGETS APPEAR RANDOMLY ON THE PLAYFIELD. THE POSITION OF A TARGET, THE VALUE OF A TARGET, THE TIME A TARGET STAYS ON THE SCREEN, AND THE TIME BEFORE A TARGET APPEARS ARE ALL UNPREDICTABLE: THERE ARE NEVER MORE THAN TWO TARGETS ON THE SCREEN AT ANY TIME.

TO ADD TO THE UNPREDICTABILITY, SOME TARGETS APPEAR WITH A VALUE OF ???. THESE ARE MYSTERY TARGETS, AND CAN HAVE A VALUE FROM -900 POINTS TO +900 POINTS. PLAYERS GO AFTER THE MYSTERY TARGETS AT THEIR OWN RISK SINCE THE ONLY WAY TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A MYSTERY TARGET IS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IS TO HIT THE TARGET. WHENEVER A TARGET IS SCORED, THE GAME PAUSES WHILE THE APPROPRIATE PLAYER'S SCORE IS TALLIED. TWO DISTINCTIVE SOUNDS ACCOMPANY THE SCORING, DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE TARGET SCORE IS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE. ALL NON-MYSTERY TARGETS (WHICH ARE ALL POSITIVE), AND ALL MYSTERY TARGETS (WHICH HAVE POSITIVE VALUES) ARE SCORED WITH AN ATTENTION-GETTING WARBLE SOUND. ALL MYSTERY TARGETS WHICH PROVE TO BE NEGATIVE ARE SCORED WITH A DISTINCTIVE PENALTY SOUND.</desc>

		<desc>I, ROBOT IS A 3-D SHOOT-EM-UP IN WHICH THE PLAYER CONTROLS THE "UNHAPPY INTERFACE ROBOT #1984"; A SERVANT ROBOT WHO HAS BECOME SELF-AWARE AND DECIDED TO REBEL AGAINST THE ALL-CONTROLLING BIG BROTHER AND HIS EVER-WATCHFUL 'EVIL EYES'.

THE GAME IS SET OVER A SERIES OF PLATFORM-BASED STAGES CONSTRUCTED FROM SOLID COLOURED BLOCKS AND TO COMPLETE A STAGE, PLAYERS MUST "ELIMINATE THE RED ZONES". THIS IS ACHIEVED BY MOVING THE ROBOT OVER ALL OF A STAGE'S RED SURFACES, CHANGING THEIR COLOUR TO BLUE. THE COLOUR SCHEME - INCLUDING TARGET COLOUR - CHANGES EVERY 26 LEVELS, HOWEVER. SO WHILE THE TARGET COLOUR IS RED FOR THE FIRST 26 SCREENS, IT BECOMES YELLOW FROM LEVEL 27, BLUE FROM LEVEL 53 AND MAGENTA FROM LEVEL 79.

IN ORDER TO REACH ALL OF THE PLATFORMS AND SURFACES, THE INTERFACE ROBOT WILL NEED TO JUMP. THIS MUST BE CAREFULLY TIMED, HOWEVER, AS JUMPING IS NOT ALLOWED UNDER BIG BROTHER'S STRICT REGIME AND HIS EVIL EYE - SITTING ATOP A PYRAMID AT THE BACK OF THE PLAYFIELD - WILL OPEN AT REGULAR INTERVALS TO WATCH OVER THE INTERFACE ROBOT. SHOULD THE EYE BE FULLY OPEN - INDICATED BY IT TURNING RED - WHEN THE ROBOT IS MID-JUMP, HE WILL BE SPOTTED AND DESTROYED, COSTING THE PLAYER A LIFE.

ONCE ALL OF THE COLOURED SQUARES ON A STAGE HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED, THE ENEMY'S SHIELD IS DESTROYED AND THE INTERFACE ROBOT WILL NEED TO BE GUIDED TO A FINAL, PREVIOUSLY INACCESSIBLE COLOURED SQUARE AT THE BACK OF THE PLAYFIELD. THE EVIL EYE IS THEN ZAPPED AND DESTROYED.

SOME LEVELS FEATURE DIFFERENT BACKGROUND ELEMENTS THAT AFFECT GAMEPLAY, SUCH AS WALLS THAT MUST BE SHOT AND DESTROYED TO REACH COLOURED TILES, OR INDESTRUCTIBLE MOVING COLUMNS THAT INTERMITTENTLY BLOCK ACCESS TO COLOURED TILES, MAKING TIMING DIFFICULT. THERE ARE ALSO ENEMIES TO BE SHOT OR AVOIDED, INCLUDING BIRDS, BOMBS AND FLYING SHARKS.</desc>

		<desc>IKARI WARRIORS IS A VERTICALLY-SCROLLING RUN 'N' GUN SHOOT-EM-UP IN WHICH ONE OR TWO PLAYERS TAKE ON THE ROLES OF TWO BANDANA-WEARING MUSCLEBOUND SOLDIERS AS THEY ENGAGE IN JUNGLE WARFARE, FIGHTING OVER LAND AND WATER TO REACH THE VILLAGE OF IKARI.

PLAYERS CAN ROTATE THEIR GUNS THROUGH 360 DEGREES, ALLOWING THEM TO FIRE AND MOVE IN ALL DIRECTIONS. STANDING BETWEEN THE SOLDIERS AND THEIR DESTINATION IS A MULTITUDE OF ENEMY SOLDIERS, TANKS, HELICOPTERS AND REINFORCED BUNKERS. 

THE ENEMY SOLDIERS UTILISE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WEAPONS, INCLUDING MACHINE-GUNS, GRENADES, SUPER GRENADES AND FLAME-THROWERS. THE GAME'S STANDARD ENEMY TROOPS WEAR BLUE UNIFORMS, BUT THERE ARE ALSO ENEMIES IN RED UNIFORMS THAT WHEN KILLED, OFTEN DROP POWER-UPS THAT EITHER GIVE PLAYERS MORE AMMUNITION, INCREASE THE POWER OF BULLETS AND GRENADES OR EVEN KILL ALL ENEMIES ON THE SCREEN. THE PLAYERS' MUNITIONS ARE LIMITED IN NUMBER SO ADDITIONAL AMMO AND GRENADES MUST TO BE PICKED UP ALONG THE WAY. 

WHILE MOST OF THE ACTION TAKES PLACE ON FOOT, UNOCCUPIED ENEMY TANKS CAN BE FOUND THAT CAN BE ENTERED AND DRIVEN. TANKS OFFER INCREASED FIREPOWER AS WELL AS RESISTANCE TO ENEMY SHOTS. TOO MANY ENEMY HITS, HOWEVER, WILL EVENTUALLY SEE THE TANK EXPLODE, THIS IS PROCEEDED BY A WARNING FLASH TO ALLOW THE PLAYER TO EXIT THE TANK BEFORE THE EXPLOSION. SHOULD THE PLAYER BE CAUGHT INSIDE WHEN THE TANK EXPLODES, A LIFE IS LOST. TANKS ALSO HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF FUEL BUT EXTRA FUEL CAN BE FOUND TO REPLENISH IT.

ANOTHER OBSTACLE THAT PLAYERS NEED TO BE WARY OF, WHETHER ON FOOT OR IN A TANK, ARE HIDDEN LAND-MINES. THESE CANNOT INITIALLY BE SEEN PUT WILL APPEAR AND FLASH AS THE PLAYER APPROACHES. THESE CANNOT BE DESTROYED AND CONTACT WITH THEM RESULTS IN AN INSTANT DEATH.

UNLIKE MOST ARCADE GAMES, IKARI WARRIORS IS NOT SEPARATED INTO DIFFERENT STAGES; THE GAME TAKES PLACE OVER ONE HUGE, SCROLLING STAGE. IKARI WARRIORS DOES HAVE A CONTINUE FEATURE, BUT IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE TO CONTINUE FROM WHERE THE LAST GAME ENDED BY FIRST HOLDING DOWN THE FIRE BUTTON, THEN PRESSING THE START BUTTON. SIMPLY PRESSING THE START BUTTON RESTARTS THE GAME FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.</desc>

O MOVIMENTO DO PERSONAGEM É CONTROLADO COM UM JOYSTICK DE 8 DIREÇÕES, E PRESSIONAR O BOTÃO ÚNICO PERMITE QUE O JOGADOR ATAQUE LANÇANDO UMA FOICE. A DIREÇÃO EM QUE A FOICE É LANÇADA NÃO PODE SER DETERMINADA PELO JOGADOR, E A ARMA IRÁ AUTOMATICAMENTE PARA O INIMIGO MAIS PRÓXIMO. ISSO FORÇA A ÊNFASE EM EVITAR ATAQUES EM VEZ DE ATACAR AGRESSIVAMENTE. O LADO DIREITO DA TELA EXIBE OS PONTOS DO JOGADOR, JUNTO COM UM MAPA DO NÍVEL. A LOCALIZAÇÃO DAS MOEDAS KOBAN É EXIBIDA NESTE MAPA, MAS OS JOGADORES DEVEM CONTORNAR AS PAREDES E OUTRAS BARREIRAS PARA CHEGAR A ESSES LOCAIS.

EXISTE UM ESTÁGIO DE BÔNUS E ALGUMAS AÇÕES EXTRAS DE AÇÃO COMO PEGAR UMA CHAVE PARA SALVAR UM PRISIONEIRO E ITENS ESPECIAIS PARA AUMENTAR A VELOCIDADE DO PERSONAGEM.</desc>

YOUR JOB IS TO GET THOSE BARS OF GOLD AND BRING THEM TO THE BUILDING WITH THE WORD, "IN" ON IT. KINDA LIKE FLICKY, YOU CAN BRING SOME OVER TO IT, THEN GET THE REST SEPERATELY, BUT YOU WILL GET LESS POINTS THIS WAY.
THE GRAPHICS ARE NICE AND VIVID (FOR AN 80'S SEGA ARCADE GAME.) AND THE ANIMATIONS ARE JUST PLAIN SILLY, AND SOMETIMES DISTURBING (WHEN YOU GET CAUGHT BY A SUITED MAN, HE THEN IS IN A BLACK BIKINI BEATING YOU WITH A WHIP!)
YOU CAN COMBAT THESE PERVERST BY PUNCHING THEM, SOMETIMES REPEATEDLY. YOU MUST JUMP OVER THE BARREL TO AVOID IT MOST OF THE TIME.

ONCE PLAYERS HAVE PROVED THEMSELVES ON THE OPENING STAGES, THEY WILL PROGRESS TO THE GAME'S LAST THREE STAGES, BLASTING OFF INTO SPACE ON A MISSION TO DESTROY THE ALIEN VEGETATION SURROUNDING THE MOON'S MAIN COMPUTER. IF THE PLAYER FAILS IN THE MISSION, THEY MUST ENDURE THE DREADED 'PENALTY ZONE'. FEATURES A HIGH LEVEL OF CHALLENGE, A WIDE VARIETY OF WEAPONS AND THE ABILITY TO CHANGE SPEED.

		<desc>INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM IS AN ACTION GAMES BASED ON THE MOVIE OF THE SAME SAME IN WHICH THE PLAYER TAKES ON THE ROLE OF ACTION HERO, INDIANA JONES. INDY MUST INFILTRATE THE LAIR OF THE EVIL THUGGEE CULT AND THEIR BOSS, MOLA RAM, ARMED ONLY WITH HIS TRADEMARK WHIP. THE GOAL IS TO FREE THE CHILDREN THE CULT HAS KIDNAPPED AS SLAVES, RECOVER THE STOLEN RELICS KNOWN AS "SANKARA STONES" AND ESCAPE FROM THE TEMPLE.

THE GAME THAT TAKES PLACE OVER THREE DIFFERENT ZONES; THE MINES, A MINE-CART CHASE AND THE TEMPLE. PLAYERS CAN CHOOSE TO START THE GAME ON ANY ONE OF THREE DIFFICULTY LEVELS: EASY, MEDIUM AND HARD. THESE ARE SELECTED BY ENTERING THE CORRESPONDING DOOR.

THE FIRST ZONE IS MADE UP OF LEDGES, LADDERS, SLIDES AND CONVEYOR BELTS. INDY MUST FREE KIDNAPPED CHILDREN BY FINDING THEIR CAGES AND WHIPPING THEM OPEN. RATTLESNAKES AND THUGGEE GUARDS PATROL THE LEDGES AND MUST BE AVOIDED OR WHIPPED. PLAYERS MUST BE CAREFUL TO NOT FALL FROM A LEDGE OR A LIFE IS LOST. MOLA RAM HIMSELF OCCASIONALLY APPEARS AND THROWS FLAMING HEARTS AT INDY, THESE MUST BE WHIPPED OR AVOIDED.
THE SECOND ZONE IS A RECREATION OF THE FAMOUS MINE CART CHASE FROM THE MOVIE AND THE PLAYER MUST GUIDE INDY'S CART TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MINE, KEEPING AHEAD OF ENEMY CARTS AND AVOIDING DEAD ENDS AND TRACK-SIDE ENEMIES. THE CART CAN BE STEERED LEFT AND RIGHT TO DIFFERENT TRACKS TO AVOID OBSTACLES.
THE THIRD ZONE TAKES PLACE IN THE TEMPLE ITSELF AND INDY MUST MAKE HIS WAY TO THE ALTAR AND RETRIEVE THE SANKARA STONE. INDY MUST AVOID GUARDS, RATTLESNAKES AND FLAMING HEARTS THROWN BY MOLA RAM. ONCE A SANKARA STONE HAS BEEN RETRIEVED INDY MUST ESCAPE THE TEMPLE THROUGH ONE OF THE FOUR DOORS THAT OPENS.

THE ZONES ARE THEN REPEATED TWICE MORE TO COLLECT THE TWO REMAINING STONES, ALTHOUGH THE LAY-OUT AND DIFFICULTY OF THE ZONES IS DIFFERENT. ONCE ALL THREE SANKARA STONES HAVE BEEN COLLECTED, INDY MUST WORK HIS WAY THROUGH A FINAL MINE AND MINE-CART SECTION, BEFORE MAKING HIS ESCAPE ON A ROPE BRIDGE AND FACING MOLA RAM FOR THE FINAL TIME.</desc>

INTREPID IS A GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYER MUST USE A 4-WAY JOYSTICK TO TAKE UP CONTROL OF A SECRET AGENT INTREPID WHOSE OBJECTIVE IS TO ENTER AN EMBASSY, FIND AND RETRIEVE A SECRET PLAN, THEN ESCAPE AS FAST AS HE CAN. THERE ARE EIGHT ITEMS THAT SPY 001 MUST FIND BY LOOKING AROUND THE ROOMS THESE DOORS LEAD TO WHICH ARE ALL WORTH 300 POINTS WHEN COLLECTED: A KEY (WHICH UNLOCKS THE LOCKED DOOR ON THE FOURTH FLOOR), A COMBINATION (WHICH IS NEEDED TO OPEN THE LOCKED SAFE), AN ID CARD (WHICH ALLOWS SPY 001 TO BYPASS THE EMBASSY'S SECURITY SYSTEMS WITHOUT ELECTROCUTION), A DISGUISE (THIS ALLOWS SPY 001 TO BYPASS THE SENTRY, WITHOUT GETTING RECOGNIZED), AN UMBRELLA (WHICH ALLOWS SPY 001 TO JUMP OFF THE EMBASSY ROOF WITHOUT FALLING TO HIS DEATH), A WRENCH (WHICH IS TO SABOTAGE THE ELEVATOR, AND TRAP THE GUARDS AT THE BOTTOM OF ITS SHAFT), A MAP (WHICH SHOWS THE LOCATIONS OF THE REMAINING ITEMS) AND A PAIR OF RUNNING SHOES (WHICH ALLOW SPY 001 TO MOVE FASTER). 

IF SPY 001 SHOULD FALL DOWN THE ELEVATOR SHAFT, GET CAUGHT BY THE GUARDS, OR GET RECOGNIZED BY THE SENTRY AT THE SAFE, HE'LL LOSE A LIFE. IF HE SHOULD JUMP OFF THE ROOF BEFORE HE'S OPENED THE SAFE (BUT AFTER HE'S SABOTAGED THE ELEVATOR), IT IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO REENTER THE EMBASSY. SHOULD THIS HAPPEN, THE BONUS TIMER SHALL IMMEDIATELY DECREASE TO 0 AND COST HIM A LIFE. ONCE SPY 001 ACCOMPLISHES HIS MISSION, HE'LL PROCEED TO HIS NEXT MISSION WHICH HAS MORE GUARDS.</desc>

NOW THE EXPERIMENT IS COMPLETE AND THE 'VISITORS' HAVE RETURNED TO HARVEST THEIR CROP. AT THIS MOMENT, THEIR GREAT SHIPS ARE ARRIVING AT MAJOR CITIES AROUND THE GLOBE PREPARING TO CONQUER AND CLAIM WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY THEIRS... THE HUMAN RACE.

TO STOP THE INVASION YOU MUST COMPLETE 4 SEPARATE MISSIONS BY DEFEATING THE INVADING ALIENS THAT ARE ABDUCTING AND MUTATING HUMANS, SNATCHING MONUMENTS AND CREATING HAVOC IN THE WORLD. THE FATE OF THE PLANT IS IN YOUR HANDS!</desc>

		<desc>RELEASED IN JANUARY 1979. KNOWN AS THE POOR MANS VERSION OF "SPACE INVADERS".

IT IS LIKE "SPACE INVADERS", WITH IDENTICAL GRAPHICS. IT USES A COLOR MONITOR INSTEAD OF A BLACK AND WHITE MONITOR WITH A COLOR OVERLAY.

IT HAS THE ADDITION OF THE FAMOUS 'COFFEE BREAK'. WHAT'S THE 'COFFEE BREAK'? THE 'COFFEE BREAK' IS A UNIQUE FEATURE IN IPM INVADERS WHEREAS AFTER EVERY 3RD WAVE OR PATTERN OF INVADERS, THE 'COFFEE BREAK' APPEARS.

IREM WAS FOUNDED IN 1974 AS 'IPM CORP.' IN HAKUSAN, JAPAN. LIKE MOST OF THEIR CONTEMPORARIES, THE COMPANY'S INITIAL PURPOSE WAS TO PRODUCE AND RENT OUT ELECTRONIC LEISURE MACHINERY TO VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. WITH THE ADVENT OF ARCADE VIDEOGAMING AND THE HUGELY POPULAR "SPACE INVADERS" (1978), IREM OPTED TO MOVE INTO THE DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING OF THEIR OWN TITLES. THEY RAPIDLY RELEASED THEIR OWN 'INVADER CLONE', THE APTLY NAMED IPM INVADER.

IPM INVADER WAS A CRUDE AND SHAMELESS COPYCAT OF TAITO'S MILESTONE, BUT YET THE SHEER POPULARITY OF ARCADE ROOMS AT THE TIME SAW THE GAME DO WELL ENOUGH TO CONVINCE THE COMPANY THAT GAMES WERE A VIABLE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.
IN 1979 THEY CHANGED THEIR CORPORATE NAME TO IREM CORP., AN ACRONYM FOR 'INTERNATIONAL RENTAL ELECTRONICS MACHINES'. THIS WOULD STAND UNTIL THE MID-80S, WHEN IT WOULD THEN BE CHANGED TO 'INNOVATIONS IN RECREATIONAL ELECTRONIC MEDIA'.
FOR THEIR FIRST FEW YEARS, IREM'S OUTPUT WAS AVERAGE AT BEST. IF ANYTHING IT COULD ALMOST BE CONSIDERED POOR: RANDOM INVADER CLONES AND POORLY PRODUCED ACTION GAMES DISAPPEARED AMONGST THE NUMEROUS OTHER TITLES OF THE DAY.</desc>

THE COWBOY CAN USE EITHER HIS FISTS, PISTOLS OR A WHIP AND MUST WORK HIS WAY ALONG A MOVING TRAIN, KILLING ENEMY COWBOYS AND COLLECTING MONEY BAGS.

THE ACTION TAKES PLACE EITHER INSIDE A MOVING TRAIN OR ON ITS ROOFTOP, WITH LADDERS ALLOWING PLAYERS TO MOVE BETWEEN THE TWO. PLAYER AND ENEMY MOVEMENT IS ON THREE PLANES AND PLAYERS CAN DUCK TO BOTH AVOID ENEMY FIRE AND SHOOT CROUCHING ENEMIES.

THE WEAPON OPTION THE PLAYER CHOOSES AT THE START OF THE GAMES SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERS THE WAY IT PLAYS, WITH WEAPONS ARRANGED BY EASE OF USE. THE THREE WEAPONS AND THEIR QUALITIES ARE:

THE WHIP HAS GOOD RANGE AND CAN KNOCK OUT SEVERAL ENEMIES AT ONCE, MAKING IT THE IDEAL BEGINNER'S PICK. 
THE PISTOL FIRES BULLETS THAT HAVE LONGER REACH AND IS THE ONLY WEAPON THAT CAN BE USED WHILE STILL RUNNING, BUT EACH BULLET CAN KILL ONLY A SINGLE ENEMY.
FISTS HAVE THE SHORTEST RANGE BUT CAN LAY OUT SEVERAL ENEMIES IN ONE PUNCH WITH A DOMINO EFFECT. DOUBLE POINTS ARE AWARDED FOR EACH HIT.

IN ADDITION TO THE MAIN WEAPONS, SUB-WEAPONS CAN BE COLLECTED BY KILLING SPECIAL, BOX-CARRYING ENEMIES. LANTERNS CREATE A WAVE OF FIRE WHICH BURNS ENEMIES TO CINDERS, BOMBS DESTROY EVERYTHING WITHIN A TEN-FOOT RADIUS AND LASSOS TIE UP ENEMY VARMINTS.</desc>

		<desc>J.J. SQUARKERS IS A SCROLLING RUN 'N' GUN PLATFORM SHOOT-EM-UP FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS IN WHICH SEVERAL RESIDENTS FROM THE PEACEFUL VILLAGE IF PISTACHIO HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED. MOST OF THE REMAINING VILLAGERS HAVE FALLEN UNDER A MYSTERIOUS SPELL, MAKING THEM VIOLENT. PLAYERS TAKE ON THE ROLES OF TWO DUCKS CALLED 'ANI KARASUKUN' AND 'OTOTO KARASUKUN' WHO SET OUT TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY MINIONS AND RESTORE PEACE TO THEIR VILLAGE. 

THE DUCKS CAN FIRE PROJECTILES TO DEFEAT THE ABSTRACT ENEMIES THEY FACE, WITH THEIR DEFAULT WEAPON BEING TOMATOES. OTHER WEAPONS - AS WELL AS BONUS AND HEALTH POWER-UPS - BECOME AVAILABLE WHEN CERTAIN ENEMIES ARE KILLED. AVAILABLE WEAPONS INCLUDE PUMPKINS, WATERMELON SEEDS, SCREWS AND SLINKYS WEARING RED SNEAKERS. 

EACH WEAPON HAS DIFFERENT STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES; FOR EXAMPLE THE SLINKYS SIMPLY WALK IN A STRAIGHT LINE UNTIL THEY EITHER MEET OBSTACLES OR THE EDGE OF SCREEN, MAKING IT EASY TO DEAL WITH ENEMIES FROM A DISTANCE. ON THE OTHER HAND, WATERMELON SEEDS CAN ONLY BE THROWN A SHORT DISTANCE BUT SEVERAL ARE THROWN AT ONCE. THIS EFFECTIVELY GIVES PLAYERS A 'SPREAD SHOT' AND IS MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN MULTIPLE ENEMIES ARE ATTACKING FROM SEVERAL DIRECTIONS AT ONCE.

J.J. SQUARKERS CONSISTS OF FIVE STAGES WITH A POWERFUL END-OF-LEVEL GUARDIAN WAITING AT THE END OF EACH.</desc>

		<name>Jack the Giantkiller</name>
		<desc>THIS GAME PLAYS A LOT LIKE "DONKEY KONG" EXCEPT THAT THE CONTROLS ARE NOT QUITE AS SMOOTH. THERE ARE 5 SCREENS TO MASTER IF YOU WANT TO HELP JACK IN HIS MISSION. YOU DO NOT GET TO PLAY EACH SCREEN AT FIRST, THEY ARE ADDED ON AS YOU PROGRESS THROUGH THE GAME. THE FIRST TIME THROUGH THE GAME SKIPS FROM SCREEN 1 RIGHT TO SCREEN 4.
THE 1ST SCREEN IS FAIRLY SIMPLE, YOU JUST HAVE TO CLIMB TO THE TOP OF THE BEANSTALK. THERE ARE A FEW ENEMIES, BUT THEY CAN BE DEFEATED BY SIMPLY TOSSING BEANS AT THEM. YOU CAN FIND THE BEANS SCATTERED ALL AROUND THE STALK, AND PICKING ONE UP ADDS ONE TO YOUR AMMUNITION COUNT (OR TWO, DEPENDING ON THE DIP SWITCH SETTINGS).
IN THE 2ND SCREEN, JACK MANUEVERS THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND ATTEMPTS TO CROSS THE DRAWBRIDGE INTO THE CASTLE, BUT LIONS AND BIRDS STAND IN HIS WAY.
THE 3RD SCREEN HAS JACK CLIMBING THE CASTLE STAIRWAY IN A SCENE THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY INSPIRED BY "DONKEY KONG". AVOID THE CAT AND THE MOUSE AND YOU CAN MAKE IT TO THE TOP.
ON THE 4TH SCREEN YOU HAVE TO JUMP FROM PLATFORM TO PLATFORM UNTIL YOU REACH THE GIANT'S LAIR. THERE WILL BE SEVERAL TREASURES, GRAB THE FLASHING ONE AND TRY TO MAKE YOUR ESCAPE.
THE 5TH SCREEN IS THE FIRST ONE AGAIN, EXCEPT THAT THIS TIME YOU ARE CLIMBING DOWN THE BEANSTALK, AND YOU HAVE FALLING ROCKS TO DODGE, AND THE GIANT HIMSELF MAY EVEN BE AFTER YOU (THAT ONE DEPENDS ON THE LEVEL).

AFTER MAKING IT BACK TO YOUR HOUSE YOU GET TO WATCH A LITTLE INTERMISSION BEFORE GOING AFTER THE NEXT TREASURE. THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT TREASURES ALTOGETHER. THE LAST ONE IS THE PRINCESS, WHEN YOU HAVE HER THE GIANT HIMSELF WILL FOLLOW YOU DOWN THE BEANSTALK, AND YOU MUST CHOP IT DOWN TO DEFEAT HIM. AFTER RESCUING THE PRINCESS THE GAME STARTS OVER WITH INCREASED DIFFICULTY.</desc>

WHEN THE DESIRED WEAPON IS HIGHLIGHTED, PRESSING THE FIRE BUTTON WILL SELECT AND FIRE THE DESIRED WEAPON.

HOSTAGES WILL RANDOMLY RUN ACROSS THE SCREEN AND CAN BE RESCUED BY RUNNING INTO THEM. SHOULD THE PLAYER ACCIDENTALLY SHOOT A HOSTAGE, ALL EXTRA WEAPONS WILL BE LOST LEAVING ONLY THE PISTOL.</desc>

		<desc>JOUST IS A PLATFORM-BASED ACTION COMBAT GAME FOR ONE OR TWO-PLAYERS (WITH THE TWO-PLAYER GAME OFFERING EITHER TEAM-UP OR HEAD-TO-HEAD COMBAT; THE FIRST TIME ARCADE GAMERS WERE GIVEN THIS CHOICE) IN WHICH EACH PLAYER CONTROLS A KNIGHT RIDING ON THE BACK OF A FLYING OSTRICH. 

THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO PROGRESS THROUGH PLATFORM-BASED LEVELS BY DEFEATING GROUPS OF BUZZARD-RIDING ENEMY KNIGHTS. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY 'JOUSTING'; BOTH ENEMY AND PLAYER KNIGHTS CARRY A LANCE AND MUST FLY AROUND THE LEVEL (ACTIONED BY REPEATEDLY HITTING THE 'FLAP' BUTTON) TRYING TO OUST RIVAL KNIGHTS FROM THEIR STEEDS BY RAMMING THEM WITH THE LANCE. THIS CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED IF THE ATTACKING RIDER IS ABOVE THE ENEMY KNIGHT WHEN THE LANCE CONNECTS. A COLLISION OF EQUAL ELEVATIONS RESULTS IN THE TWO KNIGHTS BOUNCING OFF EACH OTHER, BUT IF A PLAYER IS LOWER THAN THEIR ENEMY AT THE INSTANT OF CONTACT, THEY THEMSELVES WILL BE KNOCKED FROM THEIR STEED AND LOSE A LIFE. 

A DEFEATED ENEMY WILL TURN INTO AN EGG THAT FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. THIS MUST BE QUICKLY COLLECTED BY PLAYERS AS IF THE EGG LANDS ON A PLATFORM AND ISN'T RETRIEVED IN TIME, IT WILL EVENTUALLY HATCH INTO ANOTHER ENEMY KNIGHT THAT MUST BE DEFEATED AGAIN. 

JOUST FEATURES THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ENEMY KNIGHTS - BOUNDER, HUNTER, AND SHADOW LORD - WITH EACH EARNING PLAYERS DIFFERENT POINTS VALUES WHEN DEFEATED. A PTERODACTYL WILL APPEAR AFTER A PREDETERMINED TIME TO HUNT THE PLAYERS. 

ACCURATELY NAVIGATING THE PLAYER KNIGHTS CAN BE INITIALLY QUITE DIFFICULT AS CONTROL IS STRONGLY AFFECTED BY BOTH GRAVITY AND INERTIA. PLAYERS CAN LOSE A LIFE BY EITHER BEING KNOCKED FROM THEIR STEED BY AN ENEMY KNIGHT, OR BY FALLING INTO THE LAVA PIT AT THE BOTTOM OF EACH LEVEL.</desc>

		<desc>A WEIRD DRIVING GAME WITH A CAR THAT HAS LONG ARMS THAT REACH OUT TO GRAB A VARIETY OF EDIBLE ITEMS THAT APPEAR ALONG ROADSIDE.

THE OBJECT IS TO DRIVE SAFELY DOWN THE ROAD. PICK UP ENOUGH FUEL TO STAY ALIVE WHILE AVOIDING OTHER VEHICLES THAT GO BY, GRAB AS MANY BONUS OBJECTS AS POSSIBLE INCLUDING APPLES, CHERRIES, BANANAS, ACORNS, LIVE FISH AND MONEY, AND PARK YOUR CAR IN THE GARAGE. DRIVING WHILE TRYING TO PICK UP THE GOODIES IS DIFFICULT AND YOU CAN CRASH VERY EASILY ON THE NARROW ROADS. THE PACE OF THE GAME IS FRUSTRATING BECAUSE THE HANDS MOVE SLOWLY WHILE THE CAR ITSELF MOVES REALLY FAST, ESPECIALLY IN THE LATER ROUNDS. IF ONE OF YOUR HANDS HITS A TREE OR ANY OTHER FOREIGN OBJECT IN ITS QUEST FOR FOOD, THE CAR WINCES IN PAIN FOR A FEW MOMENTS UNTIL IT CAN USE ITS HANDS AGAIN.

YOU CAN GET A BONUS FOR PUTTING USED-UP FOOD INTO GARBAGE CANS. GRABBING FISH WHICH LEAP OUT OF SURROUNDING RIVERS IS A SAFE BET, BUT MOST OTHER BONUSES ARE PLACED, SO YOU CAN CRASH IF YOU TRY TO GRAB THEM. THE BEST STRATEGY IS ONLY TO GO FOR THE FUEL, SINCE THE CAR IS A BIG GAS GUZZLER AND YOU CAN ALSO GET A BONUS FOR LEFTOVER FUEL AT THE END OF THE DRIVE.</desc>

THIS TIME, THE MAZES HAVE NO EXIT TUNNELS THROUGH WHICH PLAYERS CAN MAKE AN ESCAPE. THE BONUS ITEMS THAT APPEAR MOVE AROUND THE MAZE AND ARE NOW SOMETHING OF A MIXED BLESSING, AS NOT ONLY WILL THEY DESTROY ANY POWER PILLS THEY COME ACROSS, BUT THEY WILL ALSO TURN ANY NORMAL DOTS THEY PASS OVER INTO LARGE DOTS THAT SLOW THE PLAYER'S MOVEMENTS CONSIDERABLY, BUT ARE WORTH MORE POINTS THAN NORMAL DOTS IF EATEN BY THE PLAYER. ANY MUTATED DOTS IN THE MAZE WILL DISAPPEAR IF THE PLAYER LOSES A LIFE. 

THE PAC CHARACTER IS ONCE AGAIN PURSUED BY FOUR GHOSTS (BLINKY, PINKY, INKY AND TIM) IN HIS QUEST TO EAT ALL OF THE DOTS IN EACH MAZE. AND, AS BEFORE, NUMEROUS POWER PILLS LITTER THE MAZES THAT, WHEN EATEN, ALLOW JR. TO EAT THE PURSUING GHOSTS. 

AS WITH PREVIOUS "PAC-MAN" GAMES, INTERMISSIONS ARE FEATURED BETWEEN CERTAIN LEVELS. JR. PAC-MAN'S INTERMISSIONS ARE EPISODIC IN NATURE, LIKE THOSE FOUND IN "MS. PAC-MAN". JR. PAC-MAN'S STORY TELLS OF THE BLOSSOMING LOVE BETWEEN JR. PAC-MAN AND A SMALL GHOST NAMED YUM-YUM.</desc>

		<name>Juno First</name>
		<desc>JUNO FIRST A VERTICALLY-SCROLLING SHOOT-EM-UP VIEWED FROM A THIRD-PERSON PERSPECTIVE IN WHICH PLAYERS MUST DESTROY WAVES OF ATTACKING ALIENS. UNLIKE OTHER SHOOTERS OF THE TIME, THE GAME'S ENEMIES DON'T LINE UP IN A GALLERY FORMATION BUT INSTEAD MOVE FREELY AROUND THE SCREEN. BECAUSE OF THIS, THE PLAYER'S SHIP CAN MOVE BOTH FORWARDS AND BACKWARDS (IN ADDITION TO LEFT AND RIGHT).

AS WELL AS THE ATTACKING ALIENS A SPHERICAL 'SPACE CAPSULE' OCCASIONALLY APPEARS ON-SCREEN AND IF SHOT, IT RELEASES AN ENEMY ASTRONAUT THAT CAN THEN BE CAPTURED. THIS MUST BE DONE WITHIN A SET TIME, HOWEVER, WITH THE SCREEN HAVING  A RED TINT FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH RESCUE IS POSSIBLE. DURING THE CAPTURE PHASE, EVERY ENEMY THE PLAYER SHOOTS IS WORTH AN ADDITIONAL 200 POINTS. 

AS A LAST RESORT PLAYERS ALSO HAVE THE OPTION TO 'WARP' TO ANOTHER RANDOM PART OF THE PLAY AREA. THIS IS HIGHLY RISKY AS IT MAY PLACE THE PLAYER'S SHIP IN A POSITION MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE ONE IT LEFT. PLAYERS ARE ALLOWED THREE WARPS PER LEVEL.

STARTING FORMATIONS VARY FROM STAGE TO STAGE AND THE ALIENS MUTATE INTO MORE DANGEROUS FORMS THE LONGER THEY SURVIVE. TO COMPLETE A LEVEL ALL ALIENS MUST BE DESTROYED.</desc>

THE PLAYER'S CHARACTER FIGHTS AGAINST HIS OR HER OPPONENT IN BEST TWO-OUT-OF-THREE MATCHES IN A SINGLE PLAYER TOURNAMENT MODE WITH THE COMPUTER OR AGAINST ANOTHER HUMAN PLAYER. THE PLAYER HAS A CHARACTER ROSTER OF NINE FIGHTERS TO CHOOSE FROM, AND THREE BOSSES, EACH WITH THEIR OWN UNIQUE FIGHTING STYLE AND SPECIAL TECHNIQUES. THE CONTROL LAYOUT IS SET TO THE SIX-BUTTON STANDARD (A LA MOST CAPCOM FIGHTING GAMES), BUT IT CAN BE SWITCHED TO A FIVE-BUTTON LAYOUT VIA DIP SETTINGS. ONE UNIQUE FEATURE IS THAT KAISER KNUCKLE WAS THE FIRST AND ONLY FIGHTING GAME THAT HAS FIVE STRENGTHS OF BASIC ATTACKS.

ANOTHER UNIQUE FEATURE IS THAT IT INTRODUCED THE POWER ZONES, WHICH CAN BE UTILIZED VIA A SUCCESSFUL HIT OF A SPECIAL MOVE WHEN A PLAYER'S "CRUSH METER" IS FULL. THE POWER ZONES (EITHER FIRE OR ELECTRIC) CAN AFFECT THE CERTAIN SPECIAL MOVE A CHARACTER HAS. BACKGROUNDS CAN BE DESTRUCTIBLE WHEN PLAYERS GET HIT TO CHARGE UP, AND WHEN THOSE METERS ARE FULL, THE NEXT SPECIAL MOVE THAT A PLAYER CONNECTS WITH HIS/HER OPPONENT WILL DESTROY THE BACKGROUND'S PROPERTIES AT WILL (OTHER PARTS OF STAGES, SUCH AS FLOORS AND WALLS ARE ALSO DESTRUCTIBLE).</desc>

THE CONTINUOUS INDUSTRIALIZATION THAT STARTED IN 1900, FINALLY LED TO UNAVOIDABLE CONSEQUENCES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 21ST CENTURY. THE WATERLEVEL ROSE WORLDWIDE AND THREATENED MANY COASTAL COUNTRIES. SO THE SHORELINES HAD TO BE MODIFIED IN ORDER TO SAVE THE HUMAN CIVILISATION FROM DROWNING. IT WAS A TIME OF GREAT CONFUSION ABOUT THE FUTURE, AND NOBODY THOUGHT ABOUT WAR. WELL, ALMOST ... THERE WAS ONE COMPANY CALLED EVAC CORPORATION, WHO MADE A GREAT PROFIT FROM UNDERHAND PRODUCTIONS AND EXPORTS OF WEAPON SYSTEMS. WHEN THE UNITED NATIONS DISCOVERED THEIR ILLEGAL TRADES, THEY POINTED EVAC TO THE GLOBAL BAN OF WEAPON IMPORTS AND EXPORTS, AND ASKED THEM TO STOP THEIR PRODUCTIONS AND TO DESTROY THEIR WEAPON FACILITIES IMMEDIATELY. EVAC REJECTED ALL ACCUSATIONS AND REFUSED TO TAKE ANY ACTIONS. SO A PREVENTIVE WAR WAS STARTED BY THE UNITED NATIONS TO STOP THE EVAC CORPORATION.</desc>

FLIP THEM FROM THE PADDLE INTO THE BINS, MATCHING THE SAME-COLORED TILES HORIZONTALLY, VERTICALLY, OR DIAGONALLY. EACH LINE OF COLORED TILES IS A KLAX. WHEN YOU'VE MADE A KLAX, YOU HEAR A FANFARE. WHEN YOU COMPLETE A WAVE, THE CROWD CHEERS. LET A TILE FALL IN THE PIT, AND YOU HEAR A SCREAM AS IT FALLS IN. IF YOU FAIL TO COMPLETE A WAVE, THE CROWD IS DISAPPOINTED. STAY ALIVE, COMPLETE THE WAVES AND DON'T DROP ANY TILES!

CATCH THE TILES AS THEY COME TO THE END OF THE RAMP ON THE PADDLE. FLIP A TILE INTO A BIN BY PRESSING THE START/FLIP BUTTON. PULL THE JOYSTICK FORWARD TO INCREASE THE SPEED OF THE CLOSEST TILE AS IT KLANKS DOWN THE RAMP. PUSH THE JOYSTICK BACK AND TOSS THE TOP TILE ON THE PADDLE BACK ON THE RAMP AND GAIN A LITTLE TIME.

THE PADDLE CAN HOLD UP TO FIVE TILES. AS LONG AS THE GREEN LIGHT IS ON BELOW THE PADDLE, YOU CAN PILE MORE TILES ON THE PADDLE. WHEN THE RED LIGHT APPEARS, YOU MUST FLIP AT LEAST ONE TILE IN A BIN OR TOSS IT BACK ON THE RAMP BEFORE YOU CAN COLLECT ANY MORE TILES. YOU CAN FLIP TILES INTO A BIN AS LONG AS THE GREEN LIGHT IS ON BELOW THE BIN.

TO SUCCEED IN KLAX, MAKE POINTS AND ALSO COMPLETE EACH WAVE. CREATE A HORIZONTAL, VERTICAL, OR DIAGONAL ROW OF AT LEAST THREE TILES (JUST LIKE IN TIC-TAC-TOE) IN THE BINS TO MAKE A KLAX AND MAKE POINTS. YOU RECEIVE THE MOST POINTS FOR DIAGONALS, LESS FOR HORIZONTALS AND THE LEAST FOR VERTICALS. WHEN YOU CREATE A KLAX, THE TILES IN THE KLAX DISAPPEAR TO MAKE ROOM FOR MORE TILES IN THE BINS.</desc>

		<name>Krull</name>
		<desc>THE LEFT JOYSTICK CONTROLS THE MOVEMENT OF THE PLAYER CHARACTER, COLWYN. HE CAN BE MOVED IN ANY ONE OF EIGHT DIRECTIONS. THE RIGHT JOYSTICK CONTROLS THE MOVEMENT OF THE PLAYER'S WEAPON, THE GLAIVE. IT CAN BE THROWN IN ANY ONE OF EIGHT DIRECTIONS. FOUR GLAIVES CAN BE IN FLIGHT AT ONE TIME AND WILL RETURN TO COLWYN WITH A BOOMERANG-TYPE ACTION. THE ONE AND TWO PLAYER SELECT BUTTONS ARE ALSO LOCATED ON THE PANEL.

KRULL CONSISTS OF FIVE SUBGAMES:
THE MOUNTAIN GAME.
THE SWAMP GAME.
THE FORTRESS GAME.
THE HEXAGON GAME.
THE BEAST GAME.

THE PLAYER MUST ACCOMPLISH A TASK IN EACH OF THE FIVE GAMES WITH EIGHT LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY IN EACH. ALL EIGHT LEVELS CAN BE REACHED IN ONE TASK BASED ON THE TIME SPENT PERFORMING THAT TASK (AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT ON THAT SUBGAME). THE TOTAL NUMBER OF LETHAL CHARACTERS ON THE SCREEN AT ONE TIME INCREASES AS THE LEVELS INCREASE.

FROM THE SKY WILL COME THE BLACK FORTRESS. FROM THE FORTRESS WILL COME THE SLAYERS, TO DEVOUR THE PLANET OF KRULL. THEN SHALL A GIRL OF ANCIENT NAME BECOME QUEEN, AND THE KING SHE CHOOSES SHALL RULE THE PLANET.

THE PLANET KRULL IS THREATENED BY THE BEAST. HIS ARMY OF SLAYERS HAS BROUGHT TERROR TO THE LAND. COLWYN MUST STOP THIS TERROR AND SAVE THE LAND AND ITS PEOPLE. ON THE DAY COLWYN IS TO WED THE PRINCESS LYSSA, THE SLAYERS, ARMY OF THE BEAST, KIDNAP HER TO BECOME THE BEAST'S BRIDE. COLWYN MUST REACH THE BLACK FORTRESS AND RECLAIM HIS PRINCESS. HE WHO MARRIES THE PRINCESS SHALL BE KING. THE BEAST MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO RULE THE PLANET.

A PROPHET ACQUAINTS COLWYN WITH THE MAGICAL PROPERTIES OF THE GLAIVE, A FIVE-BLADED SWORD, WHICH COLWYN MUST ACQUIRE. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK, HE MUST CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN AND COLLECT THE FIVE INDIVIDUAL BLADES OF THE GLAIVE IN ORDER TO ASSEMBLE THE WEAPON. THE BLADE IS PICKED UP BY TOUCHING COLWYN TO THE BLADE. BOULDERS ARE FATAL AND MUST BE AVOIDED. THE WEAPON JOYSTICK IS NOT UTILIZED IN THIS SUBGAME. THE PLAYER IS AWARDED 1,000 POINTS FOR EACH BLADE PICKED UP. POINTS ARE ALSO AWARDED FOR PLACING COLWYN IN A DANGEROUS POSITION IN FRONT OF ONE OR MORE BOULDERS.

DURING HIS TRAVELS TO DISCOVER THE BLACK FORTRESS, COLWYN COMES UPON AN ARMY OF EIGHT MEN THAT HE BEFRIENDS AND RECRUITS TO HELP HIM IN HIS QUEST TO DESTROY THE BEAST SO THAT KRULL CAN BE SAFE FROM HIS EVIL.

WITH NO INTENTIONS OF LOSING HIS NEWLY ACQUIRED BRIDE WITHOUT BLOODSHED, THE BEAST ORDERS AN ARMY OF SLAYERS TO STOP COLWYN AND HIS FRIENDS. FORGING THROUGH THE QUICKSAND-RIDDLED SWAMPS, SLAYERS MATERIALIZE FROM THE SOIL AND COLWYN PREPARES FOR BATTLE. IN THE SECOND SUBGAME, COLWYN MUST SAVE AS MANY FRIENDS AS POSSIBLE WHILE KILLING ALL OF THE SLAYERS. THE FRIENDS ARE SAVED BY TOUCHING THEM AND THE SLAYERS ARE DESTROYED BY THE GLAIVE. THE SLAYERS THEMSELVES AND THEIR SPEARS MUST BE AVOIDED. THE GAME BEGINS WITH EIGHT FRIENDS. THE NUMBER OF FRIENDS SAVED IS THE NUMBER OF FRIENDS CARRIED OVER INTO FUTURE SUBGAMES. THE FRIENDS CAN ELIMINATE THE SLAYERS WITH HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT BUT CAN ALSO BE DESTROYED THEMSELVES. RECEIVING THREE BLOWS EITHER BY HAND-TO-HAND OR BY THE SLAYERS SPEAR IS FATAL TO THE FRIENDS. THE SUBGAME ENDS WHEN THERE ARE NO LONGER ANY FRIENDS TO SAVE AND ALL OF THE SLAYERS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. AVOID QUICKSAND, AS IT SLOWS COLWYN'S ATTACK. EACH FRIEND SAVED AWARDS 1,000 POINTS (MAXIMUM 8,000 POINTS) AND 100 POINTS FOR EACH SLAYER THE PLAYER ELIMINATES.

AFTER DAYS OF TRAVEL, COLWYN AND HIS MEN HAVE FOUND THE BLACK FORTRESS IN THE IRON DESERT WHERE MANY DANGERS AWAIT THEM. WHILE ATTEMPTING TO LEAD HIS MEN THROUGH THE DANGEROUS NARROW PASSAGEWAYS THAT LEAD TO THE FORTRESS, SLAYERS MATERIALIZE ONCE AGAIN IN A SECOND ATTEMPT TO STOP COLWYN'S STRUGGLE. IN THIS THIRD SUBGAME, COLWYN MUST PICK UP ALL OF HIS FRIENDS AND DEPOSIT THEM SAFELY INTO THE HEXAGON WHILE AGAIN COMBATING THE SLAYERS. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FRIENDS IN THIS SUBGAME IS EQUAL TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FRIENDS SAVED IN SUBGAME 2. THIS SUBGAME CONCLUDES WHEN ALL OF THE FRIENDS HAVE BEEN DELIVERED TO THE HEXAGON. THE PLAYER IS AWARDED 1,000 POINTS FOR EACH FRIEND DELIVERED TO THE HEXAGON, 100 POINTS FOR EACH SLAYER HE DESTROYS AND 100 POINTS FOR EACH SLAYER REMAINING WHEN THE LAST FRIEND IS DELIVERED TO THE HEXAGON.

VICTORIOUS IN BATTLE, COLWYN MUST NOW ATTEMPT TO RELEASE HIS FRIENDS FROM THE HEXAGON. UNLIKE ENTRY, EXITING THE HEXAGON IS A STRUGGLE DESERVANT OF ITS OWN MERIT. ONCE AGAIN COLWYN MUST CALL UPON THE POWER OF THE GLAIVE. RELEASE OF HIS FRIENDS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY THROWING THE GLAIVE AT THE FRONT WALL WHILE IT IS BLACK ONLY. ANY GLAIVE STRIKING THE WALL WHILE IT IS NOT BLACK WILL STICK IN THE WALL UNTIL THE WALL BECOMES BLACK. THE SLAYERS, OF COURSE, ATTEMPT TO STOP COLWYN'S EFFORTS. IN HIS OWN ATTEMPT FOR SURVIVAL, COLWYN MUST FIGHT THEM OFF AND AVOID THEIR SPEARS. THE SUBGAME ENDS WHEN THE LAST BLACK WALL IS BROKEN THROUGH AND THE FRIENDS HAVE ESCAPED. THE PLAYER IS AWARDED 100 POINTS FOR EACH SLAYER HE PUTS AN END TO, 100 POINTS FOR EACH SLAYER REMAINING WHEN THE FRIENDS ARE SET FREE AND 1,000 POINTS FOR THE FIRST BLACK WALL DESTROYED, 2,000 POINTS FOR THE SECOND, 3,000 POINTS FOR THE THIRD AND 4,000 POINTS FOR THE FOURTH.

NOW INSIDE THE BLACK FORTRESS, COLWYN SECEDES FROM HIS FRIENDS IN ORDER TO RESCUE THE PRINCESS LYSSA. HE FINDS HER IN A LARGE CAVE CAREFULLY GUARDED BY THE BEAST. HE KNOWS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO RECLAIM HIS BRIDE AND CONSERVE THE PLANET IS TO FORGE INTO BATTLE WITH THE BEAST. IN THE FIFTH SUBGAME, THE PLAYER MOVES COLWYN TOWARDS THE PRINCESS IN ORDER TO REACH HER. AS HE PROGRESSES, THE BEAST ATTEMPTS TO STOP HIM BY THROWING FIREBALLS AT HIM. THE FIREBALLS MUST BE AVOIDED OR DESTROYED BY THE GLAIVE. IF NOT DESTROYED, THE FIREBALLS WILL RICOCHET OFF OF THE WALLS. DESTROYING A FIREBALL AWARDS THE PLAYER 100 POINTS MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF FIREBALLS IN FLIGHT. THE BEAST IS MOMENTARILY STUNNED WHEN HIT WITH A GLAIVE AND AWARDS THE PLAYER 100 POINTS. THE BEAST CANNOT BE DESTROYED AND THE PLAYER MUST AVOID TOUCHING HIM. WHEN COLWYN REACHES THE PRINCESS, HIS FRIENDS, FOLLOWING THE PANDEMONIUM OF THE BATTLE, APPEAR AND CHASE THE BEAST OFF, AWARDING 1000 POINTS PER FRIEND. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FRIENDS IN THIS SUBGAME IS EQUAL TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FRIENDS SAVED IN SUBGAME 2.</desc>

		<desc>THE PLAYER CONTROLS A SLEUTH RUNNING THROUGH A FOREST, TRYING TO GET A LEPRECHAUN'S POT OF GOLD. THE POT OF GOLD IS RANDOMLY PLACED ON THE SCREEN. WHEN THE POT OF GOLD IS TOUCHED, THE PLAYER IS TAKEN TO THE NEXT LEVEL. THE LEPRECHAUN CHASES THE SLEUTH THROUGH THE FOREST, TRYING TO CATCH HIM. IF HE IS CAUGHT, THE PLAYER LOSES A LIFE AND STARTS OVER FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE LEVEL. AFTER ALL LIVES ARE LOST, THE GAME ENDS. SHOULD THE LEPRECHAUN REACH THE POT OF GOLD FIRST, IT IS THEN RELOCATED TO ANOTHER FOREST. BY TOUCHING THE TREES, THE PLAYER'S SCORE INCREASES, AS DOES THE VALUE OF THE POT OF GOLD. AFTER EACH LEVEL AND AFTER EVERY 30 SECONDS THE LEPRECHAUN'S SPEED INCREASES.</desc>

		<desc>A SIMPLE SHOOT-EM-UP WITH MULTIPLE ENDINGS BASED ON YOUR PERFORMANCE IN EACH LEVEL. YOUR GUNS BUILD UP POWER AND GET STRONGER AS YOU TAP THE FIRE BUTTON RAPIDLY, BUT THE POWER GAUGE WILL DRAIN IF YOU STOP TAPPING THE BUTTON. 

AFTER CHARGING UP ENOUGH POWER, YOU CAN PRESS THE BOMB BUTTON FOR A SMART BOMB ATTACK WHICH USES UP THE WHOLE POWER GAUGE. WITH MORE POWER IT CREATES A BIGGER EXPLOSION. 

POWER-UPS SWITCH YOUR WEAPON TO FIRE DIFFERENT PROJECTILES, LIKE LASERS THAT SPREAD OUT AT RIGHT ANGLES, AND A FLAMETHROWER THAT REACHES FARTHER WITH MORE POWER.</desc>

		<desc>THE LIBERATOR CONTROLS CONSIST OF A TRACKBALL, FIRE BUTTON, AND SHIELD BUTTON. THE PLAYER CONTROLS A COORDINATED ATTACK FROM FOUR STAR SHIPS AT THE CORNERS OF THE SCREEN. THE PRIMARY TARGET OF THE ATTACK ARE ENEMY BASES ON A ROTATING PLANET IN THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN. THE TRACKBALL IS USED TO MOVE A CROSS-SHAPED CURSOR. THE FIRE BUTTON FIRES A MISSILE AT THE CURSOR'S LOCATION FROM YOUR CLOSEST SHIP. THE SHIELD BUTTON IS USED TO ACTIVATE FORCE FIELDS AROUND THE SHIPS. THE SHIELD CAN ONLY TAKE FOUR HITS EACH ROUND, AND THE COUNT IS SHARED BETWEEN ALL SHIPS.

AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH LEVEL, THE PLAYER IS FLYING THROUGH OUTER SPACE AND SPACESHIPS FLY ON SCREEN FROM THE LEFT AND RIGHT AND LEAVE IN AN ARC. THEY TRY TO RAM INTO YOUR SHIPS. NOTE THAT SHIELDS DO NOT WORK DURING THIS STAGE.

AFTER THIS STAGE, THE PLAYER IS TAKEN TO A VIEW OF A ROTATING PLANET. THE MOST PROMINENT ENEMIES ARE RED FLASHING MISSILE BASES. THEY SHOOT MISSILES, FIREBALLS, AND STAR BALLS AT YOUR SHIPS. THE ENEMY BASES CAN ALSO DETACH FROM THE PLANET, TURN INTO SATELLITES, AND ORBIT THE PLANET WHILE SHOOTING MISSILES. ONCE ALL MISSILE BASES ARE DESTROYED, THE PLAYER MOVES ONTO THE NEXT LEVEL. AT HIGHER LEVELS, THERE IS THE WHITE MASTER BASE. IT IS VERY INTELLIGENT, AND IT CAN CHANGE THE DIRECTION OR SPEED OF THE PLANET ROTATION TO AVOID GETTING HIT.</desc>

		<desc>IN LIGHTNING FIGHTERS AND TRIGON, THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE VERSION, THERE ARE DIFFERENT RULES DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU START THE GAME WITH ONE OR TWO PLAYERS. IN A ONE-PLAYER GAME, YOU START WITH NO BOMBS, AND WHEN YOU DIE THE GAME RESTARTS YOU AT A CHECKPOINT. IN A TWO-PLAYER GAME, EACH LIFE STARTS WITH ONE BOMB, AND WHEN YOU DIE YOU RESPAWN IN PLACE. THERE ARE SOME POWERUPS THAT ONLY APPEAR IN A TWO-PLAYER GAME AND ONE THAT ONLY APPEARS IN A ONE-PLAYER GAME. THE GAME TYPE CANNOT BE CHANGED ONCE THE GAME STARTS. A SECOND PLAYER CANNOT JOIN AN ORIGINALLY ONE-PLAYER GAME; CONVERSELY, IF ONE PLAYER DIES IN A TWO-PLAYER GAME THE GAME REMAINS IN TWO-PLAYER MODE AND THE SECOND PLAYER CAN REJOIN AT ANY TIME.

IN LIGHTNING FIGHTERS, EVEN IF YOU START A ONE-PLAYER GAME, THE GAME IS ALWAYS IN TWO-PLAYER MODE: YOU RESPAWN IN PLACE WHEN YOU DIE AND YOU START EACH LIFE WITH ONE BOMB STOCKED. THIS MEANS THAT A SECOND PLAYER CAN JOIN MIDWAY INTO A ONE-PLAYER GAME. UNFORTUNATELY IT ALSO MEANS THAT THE POWERUP THAT ONLY APPEARS IN ONE-PLAYER GAMES IN THE OTHER VERSIONS, DOES NOT APPEAR AT ALL IN THE US VERSION.</desc>

		<name>Lost Tomb</name>
		<desc>A SHOOT-EM-UP SET IN AN ANCIENT, SOUTH AMERICAN PYRAMID, IN WHICH THE PLAYER MUST EXPLORE A LARGE NUMBER OF SINGLE ROOMS IN THE SEARCH FOR TREASURE. EACH ROOM IS FILLED WITH ENEMY CREATURES THAT MUST BE KILLED OR AVOIDED. THE PLAYER IS EQUIPPED WITH A LIMITED AMOUNT OF WHIPS AND MUST COLLECT AS MANY ITEMS OF TREASURE AS POSSIBLE.

THE PLAYER IS PRESENTED WITH OPTIONS THROUGHOUT THE GAME, DEPENDING UPON WHICH ROOMS THEY WISH TO ENTER. ONCE A PATH IS CHOSEN, PLAYERS MUST PICK UP TREASURES, KILL ALL THE MONSTERS IN THEIR WAY, FIND THE KEY AND EXIT THE ROOM AS FAST AS THEY CAN; AVOIDING THE POTENTIAL OF SETTING OFF AN EARTHQUAKE. UPON EXITING A LEVEL, THE PLAYER IS PRESENTED WITH A HALLWAY WHICH SHOWS A NUMBER OF DOORWAYS ALLOWING ACCESS TO ANY ONE OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT ROOMS. THIS ALLOWS PLAYERS TO PICK THEIR OWN ROUTE THROUGH THE GAME, BUT THE DECISION WHICH ROOM TO TACKLE NEXT MUST BE TAKEN QUICKLY AS PLAYERS MUST REACH THEIR CHOSEN ROOM QUICKLY OR RISK BEING ATTACKED BY A FLOCK OF SCREECHING BIRDS.

THE PLAYER'S CHARACTER IS ARMED WITH AN EIGHT-WAY FIRING GUN (IN A SIMILAR FASHION TO WILLIAMS' 1982 CLASSIC, "ROBOTRON"). IN ADDITION TO THE GUN, THE PLAYER IS ALSO EQUIPPED WITH THREE WHIPS, WHICH CAN BE USED TO EITHER KILL ATTACKING CREATURES OR TO KNOCK DOWN ANY WALLS THAT BAR THE PLAYER'S PROGRESS. PLAYERS ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL WHIPS AT THE INTERLUDES BETWEEN LEVELS; THIS IS DONE BY INSERTING AN EXTRA CREDIT INTO THE ARCADE MACHINE AND PRESSING THE RELEVANT BUTTON.

TREASURE MUST BE CONSTANTLY COLLECTED IN ORDER TO STAY ALIVE.</desc>

		<name>Lunar Lander</name>
		<desc>LUNAR LANDER IS A 1-PLAYER COIN-OP ELECTRONIC GAME THAT SIMULATES LANDING A MANNED SPACESHIP ON THE MOON. VARIOUS VIDEO-DISPLAY PHRASES INDICATE SCORE, TIME ELAPSED DURING THIS LANDING MISSION, FUEL UNITS CONSUMED, ALTITUDE ABOVE THE MOON, AND HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL SPEED. THE FUEL CONSUMPTION AND BOTH SPEED READINGS ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE PLAYER TO DETERMINE HOW TO LAND THE CRAFT. REALISTIC ENGINE RUMBLE AND CRASH SOUNDS ACCOMPANY GAME PLAY. A HIGH BEEP WARNS OF AN ALMOST-DEPLETED FUEL SUPPLY, WHEREUPON PLAYERS CAN ADD COINS TO AUTOMATICALLY EXTEND THE GAME AND 'FILL UP' THEIR FUEL TANKS. DEPENDING ON THE QUALITY OF THE LANDING OR THE CRASH, VARIOUS MESSAGES ARE DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN.

GAME PLAY BEGINS WITH ENGINE RUMBLE AND THE LANDER DRIFTING TOWARDS THE BOTTOM
RIGHT CORNER OF THE SCREEN. HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL SPEEDS ARE CONSTANTLY DISPLAYED, INCLUDING TWO ARROWS TO SHOW HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL DIRECTIONS OF TRAVEL. ALTITUDE IS MEASURED IN DISTANCE ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE MOUNTAIN - NOT ABOVE 'SEA LEVEL'. THE SCREEN ALSO SHOWS TIME IN ACTUAL SECONDS, REPRESENTING TIME ELAPSED IN THE CURRENT MISSION.

THE OPERATOR CAN SELECT FROM FOUR DIFFERENT SETTINGS FOR FUEL UNITS - 450, 600, 750 OR 900 FUEL UNITS PER COIN (FREE PLAY IS ALSO AVAILABLE). AS THE LANDER MODULE FLIES OVER THE LANDSCAPE, IT APPROACHES THE MOUNTAINS AND A LANDING SITE. AT A CERTAIN POINT NEAR THE MOUNTAINS, THE GAME 'ZOOMS IN' FOR A CLOSE-UP VIEW OF EVERYTHING ON THE SCREEN.

IF THE PLAYER REALIZES THE SPEED IS TOO FAST AND THE LANDING LOOKS HOPELESS, HE OR SHE CAN PRESS THE ABORT BUTTON ON THE CONTROL PANEL. THIS WILL GIVE THE LANDER EXTRA THRUST AND MAKE IT FLY UPWARDS AT TOP SPEED. THE ABORT FEATURE DOES CONSUME 120 TO 180 FUEL UNITS, THOUGH, AS A DISINCENTIVE TO OVERUSING IT. IF THE ABORT BUTTON IS PRESSED TOO LATE, HOWEVER, A CRASH CANNOT BE AVOIDED.

THE FOUR LEVELS OF MISSION DIFFICULTY ARE DETERMINED BY THE PLAYER AND CAN BE CHANGED AT ANY TIME DURING THE GAME OR THE READY-TO-PLAY MODE. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FOUR ARE PRINTED ON THE MISSION SELECT PANELS AND ARE SELF EXPLANATORY, EXCEPT PERHAPS ROTATIONAL MOMENTUM. THIS FEATURE CAUSES THE LANDER TO TUMBLE AROUND WHEN EITHER ROTATE BUTTON IS PUSHED. THE LONGER EITHER BUTTON IS HELD DOWN, THE FASTER THE LANDER MODULE WILL SPIN IN THAT DIRECTION. THE PLAYER GAINS CONTROL OF THE LANDER BY PRESSING THE OTHER ROTATE BUTTON FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME.</desc>

YOU FIRST HAVE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH SIX ROWS OF ASTEROIDS TO MAKE IT TO ONE OF THE LANDING PLATFORMS. YOU HAVE SIX PLATFORMS INITIALLY BUT EACH LANDING WILL ELIMINATE ONE SINCE THERE IS ONE PLATFORM PER ASTRONAUT YOU HAVE TO RESCUE. ON YOUR RETURN TRIP UP, THE SCREEN CHANGES AND NOW YOU HAVE SAUCERS TRYING TO DESTROY YOU WITH LASER FIRE. AGAIN, YOU WILL EITHER HAVE THREE OR SIX ROWS OF SAUCERS DEPENDING IF THERE ARE METEORS IN THE AREA.

		<name>M.I.A. - Missing in Action</name>
		<desc>M.I.A. - MISSING IN ACTION © 1989 KONAMI.

M.I.A. MISSING IN ACTION IS A HORIZONTALLY-SCROLLING RUN 'N' GUN PLATFORM GAME FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS IN WHICH SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIERS MUST PENETRATE ENEMY-PACKED COMBAT ZONES TO REACH A POW COMPOUND AND RESCUE CAPTURED PRISONERS. THE RESCUED POWS MUST THEN BE ESCORTED SAFELY THROUGH A FINAL ENEMY-PACKED STAGE TO THE HELICOPTER THAT AWAITS AT THE END. 

PLAYERS BEGIN EACH STAGE ARMED WITH ONLY A COMBAT KNIFE TO PROTECT THEM, BUT OTHER WEAPONS CAN BE PICKED UP FROM FALLEN ENEMY TROOPS. THE WEAPONS ARE ALWAYS CARRIED BY SOLDIERS IN RED UNIFORMS AND RANGE FROM AN ASSAULT RIFLE, GRENADES, A FLAME-THROWER AND A BAZOOKA. PLAYERS CAN CARRY MORE THAN ONE WEAPON AND CAN CYCLE THROUGH THEM AS NEEDED. EACH COLLECTED WEAPON HAS ONLY A LIMITED SUPPLY OF SHOTS.

THE GAME'S FIRST FOUR STAGES ARE PRESENTED IN RANDOM ORDER AND MAY ALSO BE "MIRRORED", SWITCHING THE ACTION FROM FROM RIGHT-TO-LEFT INSTEAD OF LEFT-TO-RIGHT, INCREASING THE GAME'S VARIETY AND ADDING REPLAY VALUE. THE 'POW' AND 'HELICOPTER' STAGES ARE ALWAYS THE LAST TWO STAGES, HOWEVER. 

AT THE END OF EACH STAGE PLAYERS MUST FIGHT OFF A WAVE OF ENEMY TROOPS AS WELL AS DESTROY GUN EMPLACEMENTS AND WATCH TOWERS. CERTAIN SECTIONS OF EACH STAGE OFFER PLAYERS A DIFFERENT ROUTE, WITH BOTH PLATFORMS AND UNDERGROUND TUNNELS THAT CAN BE UTILIZED AND EXPLORED. AT LEAST ONE POW MUST BE SAFELY ESCORTED TO THE RESCUE CHOPPER TO COMPLETE THE FINAL MISSION, AFTER WHICH THE GAME STARTS OVER WITH AN INCREASED LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY.

THE GAME CONSISTS OF SIX STAGES:
WAR-TORN BATTLEFIELD
AIRSTRIP
JUNGLE
RAIL YARD
POW BASE
ESCORT THE POWS TO THE HELICOPTER

M.I.A. MISSING IN ACTION IS THE DIRECT SEQUEL TO 1985'S "GREEN BERET" BUT UNLIKE ITS PREQUEL, TWO-PLAYER GAMES NOW HAVE BOTH PLAYERS FIGHTING SIDE-BY-SIDE, RATHER THAN THE ALTERNATING APPROACH OF THE ORIGINAL GAME.</desc>

		<name>Major Havoc</name>
		<desc>MAJOR HAVOC IS A VECTOR-BASED SHOOT-EM-UP AND PLATFORM GAME IN WHICH THE EVIL VAXXIAN EMPIRE OVERRAN THE GALAXY MANY YEARS AGO. MOST OF HUMANITY WAS ENSLAVED AND ABDUCTED TO THE VAXXIAN HOME WORLD, ALTHOUGH A FEW HUMAN SCIENTISTS MANAGED TO ESCAPE. THE VAXXIAN EMPIRE HAS LONG SINCE COLLAPSED BUT NUMEROUS VAXXIAN SPACE STATIONS, ALL BLINDLY CONTROLLED AND DEFENDED BY ROBOTS, STILL REMAIN IN THE GALAXY, MINDLESSLY FOLLOWING THEIR ORIGINAL, PRE-PROGRAMMED ORDERS.

THE SMALL BAND OF SCIENTISTS WHO INITIALLY ESCAPED HAVE CLONED THE GREAT HUMAN HERO, 'MAJOR HAVOC' AND TASKED HIM WITH FLYING HIS 'CATASTROFIGHTER' THROUGH A WORMHOLE IN SPACE SO THAT HE MAY LEAD A CLONE ARMY AGAINST THE DREADED VAXXIAN ROBOTS AND TO LIBERATE THE REMNANTS OF HUMANITY BY DESTROYING THE ENEMY REACTORS. THE PLAYER CONTROLS MAJOR REX HAVOC, THE LEADER OF THIS BAND OF CLONES.

THE GAME IS BROKEN DOWN INTO TWO DISTINCT GAMEPLAY GENRES. THE FIRST IS A SHOOT-'EM-UP IN WHICH THE PLAYER CONTROLS MAJOR HAVOC'S SPACESHIP AGAINST THE NUMEROUS ROBOT SHIPS THAT DEFEND THE ENEMY REACTORS. THE SHIPS ARE ENCASED IN A FORCE-FIELD SHIELD WHICH MUST FIRST BE SHOT AND DEPLETED BEFORE THE SHIP ITSELF CAN BE DESTROYED. 

THE SECOND SECTION IS A PLATFORM/MAZE GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYER - AFTER FIRST LANDING ON THE SPACE-STATION BY CENTERING THEIR SHIP BETWEEN A MOVING WHITE LINE - ENTERS THE STATION. THE OBJECT HERE IS TO REACH THE CORE OF THE STATION AND SABOTAGE ITS REACTOR BY SETTING AN EXPLOSIVE CHARGE. ONCE THE CHARGE HAS BEEN SET, THE PLAYER MUST QUICKLY ESCAPE BACK TO THEIR SHIP AND AND REACH A MINIMUM SAFE DISTANCE BEFORE THE SPACE-STATION EXPLODES. 

THE SPACE-STATION HAS REDUCED GRAVITY, MAKING MAJOR HAVOC REACT SLOWLY TO PLAYERS' INPUT. EACH STATION HAS A MAZE-LIKE LAYOUT AND RED ARROWS GUIDE THE PLAYER TOWARDS THE STATION'S CORE. ONCE THE CHARGE HAS BEEN PLACED, MORE ARROWS GUIDE THE PLAYER TO THE STATION'S EXIT. THE MAZES OF SUCCESSIVE SPACE-STATIONS BECOME MORE COMPLEX AND HARDER TO NAVIGATE AS THE PLAYER PROGRESSES. PLAYERS ALSO HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF OXYGEN IN A STATION BUT MORE CAN BE COLLECTED BY RUNNING OVER THE 'O2' SYMBOLS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE MAZE.

MAJOR HAVOC FEATURES A WARP SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS PLAYERS TO SKIP LEVELS AND GAIN BONUS POINTS OR EXTRA LIVES. THE WARPS ARE ACTIVATED BY A UTILIZING A BREAKOUT-STYLE MINI-GAME AT THE BOTTOM-RIGHT CORNER OF THE SCREEN. 

THE MINI-GAME IS AVAILABLE AT THE START OF EACH WAVE AND THE WAY IT WORKS IS THIS: A TWO OR THREE-DIGIT NUMBER IS DISPLAYED AND PLAYERS MUST MOVE THE CONTROLLER UNTIL THE NUMBER MATCHES THE ONE REQUIRED TO WARP. FOR EXAMPLE, THE RED WARP REQUIRES THE NUMBER '23', SO THE PLAYER MUST MOVE THE CONTROLLER LEFT OR RIGHT UNTIL THE FIRST DIGIT MATCHES '2', THEN MUST PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON. THE BREAKOUT GAME BEGINS AND MUST BE PLAYED WHILE MOVING THE JOYSTICK TO THE '3'. ONCE PLAYERS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY ENTERED THE WARP CODE, THEY ARE TRANSPORTED TO A HIGHER LEVEL.</desc>

		<desc>MAJOR TITLE 2 IS A GOLF GAME FOR UP TO FOUR PLAYERS WHO CHOOSE TO PLAY AS ONE OF FOUR DIFFERENT GOLFERS. EACH GOLFER POSSESSES A UNIQUE SKILL-SET THAT INFLUENCES THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE CERTAIN TYPES OF SHOTS (POWER HITTER, ALL-ROUND PLAYER, TECHNICIAN AND MAGICIAN). 

THE GAME OFFERS A CHOICE OF TWO DIFFERENT COURSES AND PROVIDES THE USUAL ARRAY OF GAME MODES: TOURNAMENT, MATCH PLAY, STROKE PLAY AND A SKINS GAME.

DURING PLAY, THE ACTION IS PRESENTED IN TWO DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. THE PRE-SHOT PERSPECTIVE IS A STANDARD THIRD-PERSON VIEW FROM BEHIND THE GOLFER BUT ONCE THE BALL IS HIT, THE VIEW SWITCHES TO A TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE TO TRACK THE BALL IN FLIGHT. ONCE PLAYERS ARE ON THE GREEN, A WINDOW IS DISPLAYED SHOWING A ZOOMED-IN OVERHEAD VIEW DETAILING THE GREEN'S CONTOURS. 

MAJOR TITLE 2 TAKES A SIMPLIFIED APPROACH TO HITTING THE BALL. INSTEAD OF SETTING THE POWER AND CONTROLLING THE SHOT, THE ONLY FUNCTION OF THE SWING METER IS TO SELECT THE VERTICAL ANGLE OF THE SHOT, WHICH SETS THE AMOUNT OF BACK OR TOPSPIN APPLIED TO THE BALL. THE STRENGTH OF EACH SWING IS SELECTED PRIOR TO THE SHOT BY SETTING A POWER GAUGE TO ONE OF 16 LEVELS. 

DRAW AND FADE CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO THE BALL BY CHANGING THE PLAYERS STANCE PRIOR TO TAKING THE SHOT. HOWEVER, THE GAME SPECIFIES THE MAXIMUM DISTANCE FOR THE PUTTER IN YARDS, BUT MEASURES DISTANCE ON THE GREENS IN METERS.</desc>

		<desc>THREE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE EVENTS OF "MAKAIMURA" AND ARTHUR THE KNIGHT ONCE AGAIN FINDS HIMSELF BATTLING AGAINST THE HIDEOUS CREATURES OF DEMON WORLD. THE DEMONS HAVE NOW SEIZED THE KINGDOM AND ARTHUR RETURNS HOME TO WITNESS THE CASTLE'S LONE SURVIVOR, HIS BELOVED GUNIEVERE, MURDERED BY THE KING OF THE DEMONS, LUCIFER. ARTHUR ONCE AGAIN EMBARKS ON A ONE-MAN QUEST TO DESTROY THE DEMONIC INVADERS AND SAVE GUNIEVERE'S MORTAL SOUL. 

GAME-PLAY IS OF A VERY SIMILAR VEIN TO THAT OF "MAKAIMURA" - THE CLASSIC RUN, JUMP AND SHOOT ACTION REMAINS INTACT. DAIMAKAIMURA IS, HOWEVER, EVEN MORE DIFFICULT THAN ITS ALREADY DEMANDING PREDECESSOR. ARTHUR NOW HAS ACCESS TO SEVERAL NEW POWER-UPS TO AID HIM ON HIS DAUNTING QUEST, SUCH AS 'GOLDEN ARMOUR' WHICH GIVES ARTHUR GREATER PROTECTION FROM THE DEMONS. ADDITIONALLY, UNLIKE "MAKAIMURA", ARTHUR CAN NOW FIRE HIS WEAPONS UPWARDS INSTEAD OF JUST LEFT OR RIGHT AND, WHILE JUMPING, CAN FIRE BENEATH HIM AS WELL. 

THE GRAPHICS IN DAIMAKAIMURA ARE PREDICTABLY FAR SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF ITS 1985 PREQUEL, WITH HIGHLY IMAGINATIVE LEVEL DESIGN AND SUPERBLY-DRAWN, SMOOTHLY ANIMATED ENEMIES ALL ADDING TO THE GAME'S SUPERB GOTHIC FEEL.</desc>

		<desc>MARIO BROS. IS A SUPERB, SINGLE-SCREEN PLATFORM GAME IN WHICH THE LEGENDARY "MARIO BROS.", MARIO AND LUIGI, MUST TRY TO RID EACH LEVEL OF A NUMBER OF PESTS THAT HAVE INFESTED THE WATERWORKS: SHELLCREEPERS (TURTLES), SIDESTEPPERS (CRABS THAT NEED TO BE HIT TWICE) AND FIGHTERFLIES (FLIES THAT CAN ONLY BE ATTACKED WHEN THEY TOUCH A PLATFORM).

PLAYERS CAN JUMP UPWARDS TO HIT THE PLATFORM ABOVE THEM, WHICH WILL 'FLIP' ANY ENEMIES ON THE ABOVE PLATFORM ONTO THEIR BACKS. THE PRONE ENEMIES CAN THEN BE KICKED INTO THE WATER TO REMOVE THEM. A 'POW' BUTTON ALSO APPEARS ON A NUMBER OF SCREEN; THIS CAN BE 'BUTTED' BY A PLAYER, CAUSING ALL ON-SCREEN ENEMIES TO FLIP ONTO THEIR BACKS; AS WELL AS DESTROYING ANY ENEMY FIREBALLS THAT MAY BE AROUND. EACH POW CAN ONLY BE USED A MAXIMUM OF THREE TIMES. 

AS WELL AS THE GAME'S ENEMIES, PLAYERS ARE ALSO HAMPERED BY THE HUGE AMOUNT OF INERTIA THAT COMES INTO PLAY WHEN CONTROLLING MARIO OR LUIGI. THIS IS DUE TO THE LOW DEGREE OF TRACTION THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE MARIO BROTHERS AND THE PLATFORMS. ON LATER PHASES, ICE APPEARS ON THE PLATFORMS REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF TRACTION EVEN FURTHER. AS THE GAME PROGRESSES, WATER DROPLETS HANG BELOW THE PLATFORMS AND FREEZE INTO DEADLY ICICLES, WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY BREAK OFF AND FALL.</desc>

IN 2100, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WERE STARVING DUE TO MASSIVE FOOD SHORTAGES AND HAS CAUSED CIVIL WARS AROUND THE WORLD. CENTURIES LATER, HOWEVER, THE WORLD GOVERNMENT HAD SENT COLONISTS TO MARS WHICH BEGAN TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS. AT A NEARBY FARM, THE INFINITY CHIP WAS DISCOVERED AND IT REVEALED ALL THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE ADVANCED CIVILIZATION. IN 2309, A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE HAS BEEN SENT TO EARTH.

		<desc>AT THE END OF THE QIN'S DYNASTY, THE GOVERNMENT WEAKENED BY CORRUPTION WAS ATTACKED BY FOREIGN INFLUENCES.

THE PEOPLE WERE FLUNG INTO MISERY AND BECAME QUITE UNSATISFIED WITH THE SITUATION. THEY DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE GOVERNMENT ANYMORE AND TURNED THEIR FAITH BACK TO RELIGION.

THE WHITE LOTUS SECT SAW THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY AND TOOK OVER. THEY CLAIMED TO HELP THE GOVERNMENT TO DEFEAT FOREIGNERS AND BRING PEACE TO THE WORLD. THEIR IDEOLOGY WAS QUICKLY ADOPTED. EVERYTHING RELATED WITH THE WESTERN WORLD WAS KILLED OR DESTROYED. ANYONE AGAINST THIS PRINCIPAL WAS CONSIDERED AN ENEMY AND ACCUSED OF BEING BOUND WITH THE DEVIL. 

DRAGON OF MARTIAL MASTER AND MASTER HUANG OF PO CHI LAM COULD NOT ACCEPT THESE OUTRAGEOUS ACTIONS SO THEY BAND TOGETHER IN ORDER TO PREVENT MUCH BLOODSHED. ONE DAY THE LEADER OF WHITE LOTUS SECT SENT AN INVITATION TO DRAGON AND MASTER HUANG BUT DRAGON'S DISCIPLES SAW THIS AS A TRAP AND RECOMMENDED THAT THEY WAIT FOR MASTER HUANG, WHO WAS OUT OF TOWN COLLECTING MEDICINE.

THE MASTER DID NOT WANT TO MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE PEACE AND WENT ALONE. UNFORTUNATELY, HE WAS CAPTURED AND PUT IN PRISON. BOTH PARTIES STARTED CONFRONTATIONS AND HAVE STRUGGLED SINCE THEN. NOW DANGERS ARE HIDDEN ALL OVER THE PLACE. WHO IS CAPABLE OF RESOLVING THE SITUATION? LET'S FIND OUT!</desc>

		<desc>EARTH IS UNDER ATTACK FROM AN ALIEN RACE FROM THE 'NEMESIS' REGION OF SPACE, AND HUMAN CIVILISATION NOW STANDS ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE. THE INVADERS HAVE UTILISED ENERGY MOLECULES - KNOWN TO EARTH SCIENTISTS AS 'NEWALONES' - TO CREATE POWERFUL BEAM WEAPONS WITH WHICH TO ATTACK EARTH. IN RESPONSE, EARTH'S SCIENTISTS HAVE DEVELOPED THE 'BLACK FLY' PROJECT; A POWERFUL SPACE CRAFT THAT UTILISES THE SAME NEWALONE MOLECULE TECHNOLOGY OF THE ALIEN AGGRESSORS.

METAL BLACK IS A VERY PLAYABLE SIDEWAYS SCROLLING SHOOT-EM-UP WHICH MANAGES TO FEEL DIFFERENT TO OTHER GAMES IN THE GENRE, DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT LACKS A A PLAYER-DEFINABLE WEAPON POWER-UP SYSTEM. INSTEAD OF COLLECTING ITEMS THAT PROVIDE EXTRA SPEED, DIFFERENT WEAPONS ETC. PLAYERS MUST COLLECT THE CLUSTERS OF 'NEWALONE' MOLECULES THAT FLOAT AROUND EACH LEVEL. THESE MOLECULE CLUSTERS WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE THE PLAYER SHIP'S FIREPOWER.</desc>

		<name>Metal Clash</name>
		<desc>METAL CLASH IS A FUTURISTIC FIGHTER GAME FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS. IN ONE PLAYER MODE, THE PLAYER PILOTS THE METARIOD 'SAIBER' TO ANNIHILATE THE ALIEN ROBOTS.  

THE PLAYER PILOTS HIS ROBOT AROUND THE SCREEN DESTROYING ENEMY ROBOTS USING PUNCHES AND KICKS. FLYING SAUCERS CAN BE DESTROYED FOR A LIFE ENERGY BOOST.  ITEMS IN THE BACKGROUND CAN BE DESTROYED FOR POINTS. AFTER DEFEATING A SET NUMBER OF ENEMIES THE STAGE'S BOSS WILL APPEAR. THE BOSS IS MORE POWERFUL THAN REGULAR ENEMIES, AND HAS HIS OWN LIFE ENERGY BAR SHOWN ON SCREEN. SOME OF THESE BOSSES CAN BE DISARMED OF THEIR POWERFUL WEAPONS (SUCH AS GUNS AND ENERGY SHIELDS) WHICH THE PLAYER CAN EQUIP AND CARRY ON INTO FURTHER LEVELS.

WHEN HIT BY ENEMIES, THE PLAYER WILL LOSE ENERGY AND WILL DROP ANY WEAPONS THAT HE HAS EQUIPPED. WHEN THE PLAYER'S LIFE ENERGY IS COMPLETELY DEPLETED HE WILL LOSE A LIFE. THE GAME IS OVER ONCE ALL OF THE PLAYER'S LIVES ARE LOST.  THE GAME FEATURES NO CONTINUES.

THE TWO PLAYER GAME IS A VS. MATCH BETWEEN PLAYERS. GAMEPLAY CONTINUES UNTIL ONE PLAYER HAS LOST ALL OF HIS LIVES.</desc>

		<desc>METRO-CROSS IS AN ABSTRACT, HORIZONTALLY-SCROLLING SINGLE PLAYER RACING GAME SET IN AN AUTOMATED FUTURISTIC CITY. PLAYERS TAKE ON THE ROLE OF 'THE RUNNER', WHO MUST RUN THROUGH EACH OF THE GAME'S 32 STAGES TO CROSS THE FINISH LINE BEFORE THE TIME LIMIT EXPIRES. IF THE RUNNER FINISHES A ROUND WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT, REMAINING TIME IS CONVERTED TO BONUS POINTS AND THE NEXT ROUND BEGINS. 

OBSTACLES THAT HINDER THE RUNNER'S PROGRESS INCLUDE 'SLIP ZONES' THAT SLOW HIM DOWN IF HE TRIES TO RUN OVER THEM, 'PITFALLS' THAT  BREAK UNDER THE RUNNER'S WEIGHT AND DROP HIM INTO THE HOLES AND 'CRACKERS' THAT LAUNCH THE RUNNER UP INTO THE AIR AND CAUSE HIM TO LAND ON HIS BACK. LATER ROUNDS ALSO FEATURE 'JUMBO TIRES' THAT BOUNCE TOWARDS THE RUNNER, BARRIERS THAT EMERGE FROM THE GROUND BEFORE RECEDING BACK INTO IT, CUBES THAT MOVE THROUGH PARTICULAR COLUMNS OF TILES, MICE THAT ATTEMPT TO JUMP ONTO THE RUNNER AND SLOW HIM DOWN AND CHESS KNIGHTS AND KINGS THAT BOUNCE FROM ONE TILE TO ANOTHER. CLINGING MICE FALL OFF THE RUNNER IF HE LEAPS FROM A SPRINGBOARD.

PROGRESS IS AIDED BY YELLOW SPRINGBOARDS THAT HURL THE RUNNER FORWARDS AT GREAT SPEED (PLAYERS MUST PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON WHILE ON THE SPRINGBOARD) AND A SKATEBOARD, THAT IS UNAFFECTED BY THE GREEN 'SLIP ZONE' TILES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE SLOW THE PLAYER'S PROGRESS. BONUS POINTS CAN BE EARNED BY KICKING THE STATIC DRINKS CANS THAT CAN BE FOUND THROUGHOUT EACH LEVEL.

EVERY FOURTH ROUND IS SPECIAL, USING THE REMAINING TIME FROM THE THREE PREVIOUS ROUNDS AS ADDITIONAL COMPLETION TIME. HOWEVER, IF THE RUNNER HAS NOT FINISHED THE ROUND BEFORE THE TIME LIMIT RUNS OUT, HE WILL BE ELECTROCUTED AND THE GAME IS IMMEDIATELY OVER.</desc>

BIG'. DURING EACH ROUND, THE PLAYER MUST DEFEAT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF MR. BIG'S HENCHMEN AND THE DEADLY ENEMY MACHINES THAT PATROL THE LEVELS. THIS IS ACHIEVED EITHER BY SHOOTING THEM WITH MICHAEL JACKSON'S 'MAGICAL ENERGY', OR BY USING HIS DANCE MAGIC - THE GAME'S EQUIVALENT OF A SMART BOMB. SOME ENEMIES TAKE ONLY ONE SHOT TO DEFEAT WHEREAS OTHERS TAKE SEVERAL SHOTS BEFORE THEY ARE DESTROYED. THE LONGER THE PLAYER HOLDS DOWN ON THE FIRE BUTTON, THE GREATER THE AMOUNT OF MAGICAL ENERGY MICHAEL CAN INFLICT. AT THE START OF EACH ROUND, THE PLAYER IS GIVEN 2 DANCE MAGIC SMART BOMBS. TOWARDS THE END OF EACH ROUND, MICHAEL'S PET CHIMPANZEE, BUBBLES, WILL BE SEEN MOVING ABOUT. IF MICHAEL TOUCHES BUBBLES, HE WILL TURN INTO A POWERFUL ROBOT (THE 'MOONWALKER' OF THE GAME'S TITLE). AFTER MICHAEL HAS BECOME MOONWALKER, HE WILL BE ABLE TO SHOOT LASERS AND FIRE MISSILES. MICHAEL MUST DEFEAT EVERY BOSS ENEMY AT THE END OF EACH ROUND IN ORDER TO PROCEED TO THE NEXT.</desc>

THE GAME CONSISTS OF NINE LARGE, EIGHT-WAY SCROLLING LEVELS MADE UP OF PLATFORMS, LEDGES AND LADDERS. EACH IS POPULATED WITH ENEMY SOLDIERS AND GUN EMPLACEMENTS, AS WELL AS OCCASIONAL ARMOURED VEHICLES. AT THE END OF EACH STAGE PLAYERS MUST DEFEAT A LARGE, POWERFUL ENEMY BOSS. 

PLAYERS CAN ROTATE THEIR GUNS THROUGH 360 DEGREES, ALLOWING THEM TO FIRE IN ALL DIRECTIONS. SOME ENEMIES, WHEN KILLED, WILL DROP A RED KEY; COLLECTING THESE KEYS ALLOWS PLAYERS TO UPGRADE THEIR WEAPONS AT THE SHOP THAT AWAITS AT THE END OF EACH LEVEL. A MAXIMUM OF SIX KEYS CAN BE CARRIED AT ANY ONE TIME AND WHEN THE PLAYER LOSES A LIFE, ALL WEAPONS AND KEYS IN THEIR POSSESSION ARE DROPPED. THESE CAN BE RECOVERED AT THE START OF THE NEXT LIFE PROVIDING THEY HAVEN'T FALLEN OFF-SCREEN. 

IN ADDITION TO MAIN WEAPON UPGRADES, SECONDARY WEAPONS CAN ALSO BE BOUGHT. THESE APPEAR AS BACKPACKS ATTACHED TO THE PLAYER CHARACTERS AND FIRE WHEN THE PLAYER PUSHES UP ON THE JOYSTICK WHILE FIRING THEIR MAIN WEAPON. BOTH THE MAIN AND SECONDARY WEAPONS HAVE ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT OF AMMO BUT MORE CAN BE BOUGHT FROM THE END-OF-LEVEL SHOPS.</desc>

PLAYER CONTROL CONSISTS OF A MIDI TRAK-BALL CONTROL AND A FIRE BUTTON. THE ARCHER IS MOVED BY ROTATING THE MIDI TRAK-BALL CONTROL. THE ARCHER CAN BE MOVED IN ALL DIRECTIONS, BUT ONLY WITHIN THE BOTTOM FIFTH OF THE SCREEN. HOWEVER, THE ARCHER MUST MOVE AROUND MUSHROOMS, FLOWERS, AND DDT BOMBS, SINCE THESE ARE FIXED AND NOT 'TRANSPARENT' OBJECTS. PRESSING THE FIRE BUTTON CAUSES THE ARCHER TO EMIT AN ARROW THAT TRAVELS UPWARD. THE ARCHER MAY FIRE ONE OR MANY ARROWS (BY HOLDING DOWN THE FIRE BUTTON CONSTANTLY). BUT ONLY ONE ARROW WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN AT A TIME.</desc>

		<desc>A HORIZONTAL TANK SHOOTER GAME, WITH GREAT ATMOSPHERE PARALLAX SCROLLING BACKGROUND.

THE MID-DAY HEAT IS RAPIDLY BECOMING UNBEARABLE AS THE SUPPLY HELICOPTER LOWERS YOUR BATTLE TANK ON TO EDGE OF THE DESERT. YOU HAVE A WHOLE DAY'S TRAVELLING AHEAD, 90 MILES ACROSS THE SEEMINGLY ENDLESS DESERT, UNTIL YOU REACH THE TARGET OF YOUR MISSION - THE ENEMY'S DESERT FORTRESS. ONLY AFTER YOU HAVE MANAGED TO DESTROY IT, WILL IT BE SAFE FOR THE TRANSPORT HELICOPTER TO COLLECT YOU AND SEND YOU ON ANOTHER FULL-SCALE MISSION.

UNFORTUNATELY, THE GOING ACROSS THE DESERT IS NOT EASY. YOUR TANK HAS RUN OUT OF SUPER-MISSILES AND YOU MUST REPLENISH YOUR ARMOURY FROM THE STOCKPILES ON THE WAY. IF YOU DON'T COLLECT ENOUGH YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DESTROY THE FORTS AND THE ENEMY BASE, WHICH IS SO WELL PROTECTED YOU NEED THREE MISSILE HITS TO PUT IT OUT OF ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU HAVE UNLIMITED SUPPLIES OF SHELLS FOR YOUR HEAVY DUTY GUN THAT CAN FIRE IN ALL DIRECTIONS.</desc>

IF THE MULTI-STAGE SHIP IS HIT, THE PLAYER CONTINUES WITH WHATEVER STAGES REMAIN. IF PLAYERS ACHIEVE A SCORE OF 30,000, THEY ARE AWARDED A FREE GAME AND THEIR SCORE CONTINUES TO ACCUMULATE.

UPON COMPLETION OF THE FIRST EIGHT SCREENS, THE PLAYER'S SHIP WILL REVERT BACK TO ITS SMALL, SINGLE-STAGE INCARNATION AND THE GAME BEGINS AGAIN WITH AN INCREASED LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY.</desc>

		<desc>MOON PATROL IS A HORIZONTALLY-SCROLLING SHOOT-EM-UP IN WHICH THE PLAYER TAKES THE ROLE OF A LUNA CITY POLICE OFFICER ASSIGNED TO SECTOR NINE, HOME OF THE TOUGHEST THUGS IN THE GALAXY. 

THE PLAYER CONTROLS A MOON BUGGY THAT TRAVELS OVER THE MOON'S SURFACE, TRYING TO AVOID OR DESTROY ANY OBSTACLES IN ITS PATH, INCLUDING CRATERS, ROCKS AND MINES. UFOS ATTACK THE BUGGY FROM ABOVE BY DROPPING BOMBS, SOME UFO BOMBS WILL CREATE A NEW CRATER WHEN THEY HIT THE GROUND, GENERATING A NEW OBSTACLE TO AVOID.

THE BUGGY CAN JUMP TO AVOID CRATERS, MINES AND ROCKS, IT ALSO HAS BOTH FRONT AND VERTICALLY-MOUNTED CANNONS THAT FIRE MISSILES SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE VERTICAL CANNON IS TO DESTROY UFOS WHILE THE FRONT-CANNON CAN TAKE OUT OBSTACLES THAT LIE IN THE BUGGY'S PATH.

MOON PATROL HAS FIVE DIFFERENT STAGES SPREAD OVER 26 CHECK-POINTS, EACH DESIGNATED A LETTER OF THE ENGLISH ALPHABET. THE FIVE CHECKPOINTS THAT DENOTE A NEW STAGE ARE E, J, O, T AND Z AND EACH NEW STAGE SEES A CHANGE IN BACKGROUND GRAPHICS AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN DIFFICULTY. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE INTRODUCTION OF LANDMINES IN THE THIRD STAGE (STAGE 'J').

A STATUS PANEL IS DISPLAYED AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN THAT GIVES THE PLAYER USEFUL INFORMATION. A PROGRESS BAR SHOWING THE FIVE MAJOR CHECKPOINTS AND THE PLAYER'S CURRENT POSITION IS DISPLAYED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PANEL. ABOVE THE PROGRESS BAR IS AN INDICATOR OF THE CURRENT CHECKPOINT, THE TIME SPENT IN THE STAGE AND THREE INDICATOR LIGHTS: THE TOP LIGHT INDICATES UPCOMING ENEMY AERIAL ATTACKS, THE MIDDLE ONE INDICATES AN UPCOMING MINEFIELD AND THE BOTTOM ONE INDICATES ENEMIES APPROACHING FROM BEHIND.

AT THE END OF EACH STAGE BONUS POINTS ARE AWARDED BASED ON HOW QUICKLY THE STAGE WAS COMPLETED.</desc>

		<desc>THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO BUMP YOUR ENEMIES - SPACE BUGS - OFF THE SOLAR BASE USING MOTOS, YOUR SHIP. WHEN YOU BUMP ALL OF THEM OFF, YOU MOVE TO THE NEXT BASE OR ROUND. IF MOTOS IS KNOCKED OFF THE BASE, YOU LOSE ONE LIFE. THE GAME IS OVER WHEN YOU LOSE ALL YOUR LIVES.

YOU CAN COLLECT POWER PARTS AND JUMP PARTS LYING ON THE SOLAR BASE BY SIMPLY HAVING MOTOS TOUCH THEM. THE COLLECTED PARTS WILL BE DISPLAYED IN THE LOWER LEFT CORNER OF THE SCREEN AND YOU CAN USE THEM IN THE NEXT ROUND. MOTOS CAN BE OUTFITTED WITH NO MORE THAN SEVEN POWER PARTS; THE MORE POWER PARTS ADDED, THE MORE POWERFUL MOTOS IS. HOWEVER, MOTOS CAN ONLY BE OUTFITTED WITH ONLY ONE JUMP PART PER ROUND. WITH A JUMP PART, MOTOS CAN JUMP OVER TWO SQUARES BY MOVING THE JOYSTICK IN THE DESIRED DIRECTION AND PRESSING THE JUMP BUTTON. ONE JUMP ON A SQUARE CRACKS THE SQUARE AND A SECOND JUMP IN THE SAME SPOT MAKES A HOLE IN THE SOLAR BASE.

YOU CAN OUTFIT MOTOS WITH THESE PARTS IN THE POWER PARTS OR JUMP PARTS SCREEN DISPLAYED AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH ROUND. SELECT THE NUMBER OF PARTS YOU WANT BY MOVING LEFT AND RIGHT WITH THE JOYSTICK, AND LOCK THEM IN PLACE BY PRESSING THE JUMP BUTTON. YOU CAN USE THE SELECTED PARTS FOR ONE ROUND ONLY; THEY WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE IN SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS.

LINGER TOO LONG ON THE PLAYING FIELD AND SHOOTING STARS WILL BEGIN TO FALL PERIODICALLY ONTO THE SOLAR BASE. THE STARS ARE AIMED AT MOTOS, AND WHEN THEY MISS THEY CRACK A SQUARE OR BREAK A HOLE IN THE SOLAR BASE (LIKE THEY DO TO THE BASE BEHIND THE MOTOS LOGO IN THE ATTRACT MODE'S TITLE SEQUENCE).</desc>

		<name>Mr. Do!</name>
		<desc>MR. DO! IS A COLOURFUL AND ADDICTIVE MAZE GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYER TAKES ON THE ROLE OF THE EPONYMOUS MR. DO, A CIRCUS CLOWN, WHO MUST CLEAR EACH LEVEL OF EITHER CHERRIES OR MONSTERS. THE GAME'S SINGLE SCREEN LEVELS ARE MADE UP OF TUNNELS SURROUNDED BY A COLOURFUL, SOIL-LIKE SUBSTANCE. THIS SOIL CAN BE DUG THROUGH TO CREATE NEW TUNNELS, ALLOWING MR. DO TO ESCAPE HIS ENEMIES AND TO REACH THE MANY CHERRIES THAT LITTER THE LEVELS. A NUMBER OF APPLES ARE ALSO SCATTERED AROUND EACH LEVEL, AND MR. DO CAN PUSH THEM ALONG TUNNELS (TO BLOCK AND/OR KILL MONSTERS) OR CAN TUNNEL BENEATH THEM TO DROP THEM ONTO THE HEADS OF ANY PURSUING ENEMIES. MR. DO HIMSELF CAN ALSO BE KILLED BY A FALLING APPLE.

MR. DO IS ARMED WITH A 'POWERBALL' THAT CAN BE FIRED DOWN A TUNNEL, IT WILL THEN BOUNCE AROUND THE TUNNELS UNTIL IT EITHER RETURNS TO MR. DO, OR COMES INTO CONTACT WITH, AND KILLS, ONE OF THE LEVEL'S MONSTERS. THE POWERBALL REGENERATES IMMEDIATELY THE FIRST TIME YOU USE IT, BUT TAKES LONGER EACH TIME IT IS USED TO RETURN TO YOUR HANDS. AS EACH LEVEL PROGRESSES, THE MONSTERS THEMSELVES START TO DIG TUNNELS OF THEIR OWN IN THEIR PURSUIT OF MR. DO. MONSTERS CAN ALSO PUSH THE APPLES.

EACH SCREEN HAS A DOORWAY THROUGH WHICH THE MONSTERS ENTER THE LEVEL. ONCE ALL OF THE MONSTERS HAVE APPEARED, THE DOORWAY WILL TURN INTO A 'PRIZE', (ICE CREAM, BISCUITS, ETC.). IF MR. DO COLLECTS THE PRIZE, THE 'ALPHAMONSTER' AND HIS THREE 'MUNCHER' HENCHMEN WILL APPEAR. THE ALPHAMONSTER MAY BE IN THE EXTRA BOX AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN OR BE MOVING AROUND THE SCREEN. THE ALPHAMONSTER AND THE MUNCHERS CANNOT BE EASILY CRUSHED UNDER APPLES BECAUSE THEY TEND TO EAT THEM. THEY CAN BE KILLED INDIVIDUALLY WITH THE POWERBALL OR BY KILLING THE ALPHAMONSTER ITSELF, AT WHICH POINT ANY REMAINING MUNCHERS WILL TURN INTO APPLES.

AFTER EVERY THREE LEVELS, THERE IS A BRIEF INTERMISSION IN WHICH A TUNE IS PLAYED AND A LARGE, ANIMATED MR. DO APPEARS, TOGETHER WITH SOME OF THE GAME'S MONSTERS. THE TIME TO COMPLETE EACH LEVEL AND THE PREFERRED METHOD (MONSTERS, CHERRIES, ALPHAMONSTERS, OR DIAMOND) IS SHOWN. THE PATHS IN THE FIRST LEVEL RESEMBLE A 'D', AFTER THIS EACH LEVEL'S TUNNELS RESEMBLE A DIGIT, ('2', '3', '4' ETC.) UP TO '0' FOR LEVEL 10.

A LEVEL CAN BE COMPLETED ANY ONE OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS: EITHER BY COLLECTING ALL OF THE ON-SCREEN CHERRIES; BY KILLING ALL OF THE MONSTERS, BY COMPLETING THE EXTRA BOX, OR BY COLLECTING THE DIAMOND. THE LATTER APPEARS ONLY VERY OCCASIONALLY ('SPECIAL' AWARDS AN EXTRA CREDIT).</desc>

		<name>Mr. Do's Castle</name>
		<desc>FOR THE SECOND GAME IN THE MR. DO! SERIES, THE CLOWN FINDS HIMSELF IN A TRADITIONAL PLATFORMS AND LADDERS GAME. EACH LEVEL IS MADE UP OF SIX FLOORS (SEVEN INCLUDING THE CASTLE'S RAMPARTS) AND ALL ARE JOINED BY A NUMBER OF INTER-CONNECTING LADDERS. THE LADDERS COME IN TWO DIFFERENT VARIETIES: VERTICAL LADDERS, WHICH ARE FIXED AND CANNOT BE MOVED; AND DIAGONAL LADDERS, WHICH CAN BE PUSHED LEFT OR RIGHT FROM THE TOP OF THE LADDER. THIS ALLOWS MR. DO TO REACH OTHER AREAS OF THE LEVEL AND IS SOMETIMES NECESSARY TO REDIRECT THE PATH OF ANY PURSUING ENEMIES. 

THE ENEMIES IN MR. DO'S CASTLE COME IN THE FORM OF UNICORNS, AND AS WITH THE ENEMIES OF THE FIRST GAME, THEY WILL HUNT DOWN AND TRY TO KILL MR. DO. REPLACING THE 'POWERBALL' WEAPON OF THE ORIGINAL GAME, MR. DO IS NOW ARMED WITH A MALLET. THIS CAN BE USED TO TEMPORARILY STUN THE UNICORNS AND BUY MR. DO SOME TIME TO ESCAPE; BUT ITS PRIMARY FUNCTION IS TO KNOCK OUT THE FLOOR BLOCKS THAT FORM EACH LEVEL'S PLATFORMS.

MOST BLOCKS ARE MARKED WITH A CHERRY AND COLLECTING ALL OF THESE WILL COMPLETE THE LEVEL (ON LATER REVISIONS ONLY, SEE UPDATES BELOW). A LEVEL CAN ALSO BE COMPLETED BY KILLING ALL OF THE UNICORNS. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY USING THE MALLET TO REMOVE BLOCKS AND KNOCK HOLES IN THE PLATFORMS. THE UNICORNS WILL FALL INTO ANY HOLES THAT THE PLAYER HAS CREATED; SOME SIMPLY FALL THROUGH TO THE PLATFORM BELOW, WHEREAS OTHERS ARE TRAPPED. TRAPPED UNICORNS CAN BE HIT WITH MR. DO'S MALLET AND KNOCKED TO A LOWER PLATFORM - USEFUL FOR BUYING A FEW EXTRA SECONDS FOR THE PLAYER. IF LEFT ALONE, HOWEVER, THE UNICORNS WILL CLIMB OUT, FILLING THE HOLE IN BEHIND THEM, AND TRANSFORM INTO MUCH NASTIER ENEMIES. THESE NEW ENEMIES CANNOT BE STUNNED WITH THE MALLET AND MUST BE KILLED BY DROPPING BLOCKS ONTO THEM FROM THE PLATFORM ABOVE.

SOME SECTIONS OF A PLATFORM HAVE TWO 'SKULL' BLOCKS AT EITHER END OF THEM, WITH NORMAL BLOCKS IN BETWEEN. WHEN BOTH SKULL BLOCKS ARE KNOCKED OUT WITH THE MALLET, ALL OF THE BLOCKS IN BETWEEN WILL FALL TO REVEAL WOODEN FLOORBOARDS. THIS IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN KILLING SEVERAL ENEMIES AT ONCE.

EACH LEVEL ALSO HAS THREE 'KEY' BLOCKS. IF MR. DO KNOCKS OUT ALL THREE KEY BLOCKS, A LARGE DOOR OPENS AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN TO REVEAL A SHIELD WHICH, WHEN COLLECTED, TURNS THE UNICORNS INTO 'ALPHAMONSTERS'. THE ALPHAMONSTERS FLEE FROM MR. DO AND CAN BE KILLED EITHER WITH THE MALLET, OR BY DROPPING A FLOOR BLOCK ONTO THEM FROM ABOVE. WHEN MR. DO KILLS AN ALPHAMONSTER, ITS LETTER APPEARS ON A FLAGPOLE AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. IF THE PLAYERS COLLECTS ALL FIVE LETTERS, AN EXTRA LIFE IS AWARDED.</desc>

		<desc>MR DO'S THIRD ARCADE OUTING IS ANOTHER PLATFORM GAME, FOLLOWING ON FROM THE SUPERB "MR. DO'S CASTLE", RELEASED A YEAR EARLIER. THE SYNONYMOUS MR. DO! CHERRIES ARE PRESENT AND CORRECT, BUT ARE NOT USED IN THE SAME WAY AS IN OTHER GAMES IN THE SERIES. IN BOTH "MR DO!" AND "MR. DO'S CASTLE", COLLECTING ALL OF THE CHERRIES AVAILABLE WAS A WAY OF COMPLETING A LEVEL. IN WILD RIDE, HOWEVER, COLLECTING THEM MERELY CHANGES THE 'PRIZE' AWARDED UPON REACHING THE LEVEL'S GOAL. THIS CAN BE ONE OR TWO LETTERS FROM EXTRA, OR OTHER ITEMS WHICH SIMPLY AWARD BONUS POINTS. WHEN MR. DO REACHES HIS GOAL, HE WAVES A FLAG WHILE THE BONUS COUNTER IS ADDED TO HIS SCORE.

THE GAMEPLAY IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF NINTENDO'S LEGENDARY "DONKEY KONG", WITH MR. DO STARTING EACH LEVEL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, TRYING TO MAKE HIS WAY TO THE EXIT AT THE VERY TOP. MR. DO DOESN'T HAVE EITHER HIS POWERBALL OR MALLET IN THIS GAME, BUT HOLDING THE ACTION BUTTON MAKES HIM RUN FASTER ALONG THE TRACK. THE TRADE-OFF OF THIS IS THAT HIS BONUS POINTS DEPLETE MUCH QUICKER. WHEN ALL OF THE EXTRA LETTERS ARE COLLECTED, THE PLAYER IS AWARDED WITH AN EXTRA LIFE.

EACH OF THE GAME'S SIX LEVELS IS SET ON A ROLLER COASTER, WITH EACH HAVING ITS OWN THEME, TRAPS AND PITFALLS. WILD RIDE DOESN'T FEATURE THE INTERMISSION SCREENS THAT APPEAR IN PREVIOUS MR.DO GAMES.

THE LEVELS ARE:
LEVEL 1, ROLLER COASTER. 
LEVEL 2, PIRATE SHIP. 
LEVEL 3, THREE ELEVATORS. 
LEVEL 4, CASTLE ON SCREEN. 
LEVEL 5, MULTIPLE COLUMNS. 
LEVEL 6, SIX RINGS.

AFTER LEVEL SIX THE LEVELS ARE REPEATED.</desc>

THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENTLY COLORED WOODPECKERS THAT HATCH FROM THE LARGE EGGS POSITIONED ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES OF THE SCREEN, WHICH SET OUT TO STOP HIM. THE PLAYER HAS A SINGLE BUTTON WITH WHICH TO MAKE NAUGHTY MOUSE JUMP OVER THEM.

SOME OF THE LADDERS MAY ALSO BECOME ELECTRIFIED AFTER NAUGHTY MOUSE HAS CLIMBED THEM, FORBIDDING HIM TO GO BACK DOWN THEM AGAIN ON PAIN OF DEATH. ONCE HE HAS REACHED HIS GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE, HE WILL RECEIVE THE STAGE'S REMAINING TIME AS BONUS POINTS AND PROCEED TO THE NEXT STAGE.

THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NAUGHTY MOUSE AND WOODPECKER IS THE COLOR PALETTES, AND STAGE ARRANGEMENTS.</desc>

		<name>New Rally X</name>
		<desc>NEW RALLY-X IS A SCROLLING, OVERHEAD MAZED-BASED RACING GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYER DRIVES A RACING CAR AROUND A MAZE AND MUST COLLECT TEN YELLOW FLAGS BEFORE THE CAR'S FUEL RUNS OUT. IN-GAME OPPONENTS CONSIST OF RED ENEMY CARS THAT PURSUE AND TRY TO RAM INTO AND DESTROY THE PLAYER'S CAR. THE ENEMY CARS ARE FASTER MOVING THAN THE PLAYER'S VEHICLE. 

THE PLAYER'S CAR AUTOMATICALLY MOVES IN WHICHEVER DIRECTION THE JOYSTICK IS PUSHED AND IF IT RUNS INTO A WALL, IT WILL TURN AUTOMATICALLY AND CONTINUE MOVING. TO DISRUPT THE CHASING ENEMY CARS A SMOKE-SCREEN CAN BE ACTIVATED THAT TRAILS BEHIND THE PLAYER'S CAR, CAUSING ANY PURSUING VEHICLES TO CRASH. ACTIVATING THE SMOKE SCREEN USES A SMALL AMOUNT OF FUEL, HOWEVER, SO PLAYERS MUST BE CAREFUL TO NOT OVERUSE IT.

EACH MAZE ALSO HAS ROCK FORMATIONS AND CRASHING INTO THESE WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF A PLAYER CAR. A RADAR DISPLAY TO THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE PLAYING AREA SHOWS THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THE FLAGS, ROCKS AND ENEMY VEHICLES. 

IN ADDITION TO THE STANDARD TEN FLAGS, EACH MAZE ALSO CONTAINS A SPECIAL FLAG (INDICATED BY THE LETTER "S"). IF COLLECTED, THE VALUE EARNED FOR THE ROUND'S REMAINING FLAGS DOUBLES FROM 100 TO 200 POINTS. IF THE PLAYER DIES BEFORE THE END OF THAT ROUND, THE FLAG VALUE IS SET BACK TO 100 POINTS AND THE DOUBLE BONUS IS LOST. 

THE MAZES ALSO CONTAIN A 'LUCKY FLAG'. THIS IS MARKED WITH THE LETTER 'L' AND - PROVIDING THERE ARE STILL STANDARD FLAGS REMAINING - AWARDS THE PLAYER EXTRA POINTS FOR REMAINING FUEL, AFTER WHICH THE ROUND WILL CONTINUE AS NORMAL. UPON COMPLETION OF A ROUND, BONUS POINTS ARE AWARDED BASED ON HOW MUCH FUEL THE PLAYER HAS REMAINING.

AS PLAYERS PROGRESS THROUGH THE ROUNDS, THE NUMBER OR PURSUING ENEMY CARS INCREASES.</desc>

		<desc>AN ATHLETICS GAME FEATURING 8 TOURNAMENTS:

INTERCEPTOR
A REAL LIFE MISSILE DEFENSE STYLE-CONTEST AS MISSILES ARE BEING LAUNCHED FROM A SHIP, AND YOU MUST USE YOUR MYSTICAL POWERS TO STOP THE ONCOMING MISSILES. THE OUTSIDE BUTTONS (1 &amp; 3) MAKE YOU STEP TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT, AND THE MIDDLE BUTTON IS FIRE. FAILURE TO HIT THE MISSILE RESULTS IN YOU BEING BLOWN UP. IF YOU SELECT SHARON FROM FRANCE, MOST OF HER CLOTHES WOULD DISAPPEAR EXCEPT FOR THE BOTTOM PART OF HER SUIT.

NIAGARA JUMPS
THE FINAL COMPETITION IN THE TOURNAMENT. IT IS ALSO CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT COMPETITION IN THE GAME. VERY SIMILAR TO THE TRIPLE JUMP COMPETITION IN THE OLYMPICS. THE OBJECT IS THIS CONTEST IS TO MAKE IT ACROSS THE FALLS. ALTERNATELY PRESS BUTTONS 1 AND 3 TO BUILD UP SPEED, THEN PRESS BUTTON 2 THREE TIMES. IF YOU DON'T TIME YOURSELF PROPERLY, YOU WILL SINK AND DROWN AND YOU WILL GO DOWN THE STEEP FALLS.

NONSTOP ROCK CHOP
YOU MUST SMASH AS MANY ROCKS AS YOU CAN BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT. RAPIDLY PRESS BUTTONS 1 AND 3 ALTERNATELY UNTIL THE GAUGE IS FULL, THEN PRESS BUTTON 2 TO SMASH THE ROCK.

NUMAN SNIPER
IN THIS CONTEST, MONSTERS WILL JUMP OUT OF THE SEA FROM THREE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. YOUR OBJECT, DESTROY THEM. PRESS BUTTONS 1, 2 OR 3 VARYING BY THEIR LOCATION TO SHOOT.

SCUD TOSS
JUST AS IN THE JAVELIN COMPETITION IN THE OLYMPICS. PLAYED ON A "TRACK AND FIELD"-LIKE FIELD WITH AN ONLY EXCEPTION -- A MISSILE. RAPIDLY AND CONTINUOUSLY PRESS THE TWO RUN BUTTONS AND THEN PUSH AND HOLD THE MIDDLE BUTTON TO SET THE ANGLE OF WHICH YOU WOULD THROW THE MISSILE. AGAIN, LIKE INTERCEPTOR, IF YOU SELECT SHARON -- THEN AGAIN IF SHE IS FAULTED, SHE WILL BE MISSING MOST OF HER CLOTHES.

TOWER TOPPER
HERE YOU ARE EXPECTED TO CLIMB UP TO THE BUILDING ROOFTOP WITH THE FASTEST TIME POSSIBLE. PRESS BUTTON 2 REPEATEDLY TO SCALE THE SIDE OF A BUILDING. IF YOU PRESS IT TOO EARLY -- YOU WON'T MOVE, BUT IF YOU PRESS IT TOO LATE -- YOU WILL FALL OFF.

TURBO DASH
MUCH LIKE THE 100M DASH IN THE OLYMPICS -- ONLY THE CORE ELEMENTS HAVE SLIGHTLY CHANGED. YOU ARE RACING AGAINST A DRAG RACER AND ANOTHER PLAYER. PRESS THE TWO OUTSIDE BUTTONS (1 &amp; 3) IN ALTERNATE FASHION UNTIL YOUR RSI (OR 'SPECIAL SPEED') SETS IN.

VS. EXPRESS
VERY SIMILAR TO A FAMILIAR SCENE IN THE SUPERMAN COMIC BOOKS. YOU MUST STOP THE ONCOMING TRAIN USING YOUR MAGICAL POWERS AND SEND IT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION BACKWARDS. PRESS BUTTON 2 TO STOP THE TRAIN, THEN HAMMER THE OUTSIDE BUTTONS TO BUILD UP POWER BEFORE BUNGING IT BACK DOWN THE TRACK. IF YOU DON'T TIME THIS RIGHT -- THE TRAIN WILL RUN YOU OVER.</desc>

		<name>Off the Wall</name>
		<desc>OFF THE WALL IS AN ARCADE GAME PRODUCED BY ATARI AND RELEASED IN NORTH AMERICA IN 1991. A MODERN REMAKE OF BREAKOUT, THIS GAME INTRODUCES MANY NEW GAMEPLAY FEATURES TO THE BAT-AND-BALL GENRE, AND IT INCORPORATES SOME ELEMENTS FROM PONG AS WELL. IT SUPPORTS UP TO THREE PLAYERS SIMULTANEOUSLY (THOUGH MOST CABINETS ONLY SUPPORT TWO), AND THE GAME'S GRAPHICS INCLUDE MANY BACKGROUNDS MODELED AFTER MODERN ABSTRACT ART.

THE OBJECTIVE OF OFF THE WALL IS TO SCORE AS MANY POINTS AS POSSIBLE BY DESTROYING SQUARE BLOCKS IN A NEVER-ENDING SERIES OF LEVELS. THE PLAYER CONTROLS A PADDLE USING AN ANALOG KNOB OR A JOYSTICK (DEPENDING ON THE MACHINE CONFIGURATION). THE PADDLE MOVES ALONG ONE EDGE OF THE PLAYFIELD, AND A BALL FLIES AROUND THE PLAYFIELD AND BOUNCES OFF THE WALLS AND THE PADDLE. WHEN A BALL HITS A BLOCK, THE BLOCK DISAPPEARS (UNLESS IT IS INDESTRUCTIBLE). A SQUARE EXIT IS PLACED ON THE SCREEN, AND DIRECTING THE BALL INTO THIS EXIT CAUSES ALL REMAINING BLOCKS ON THE SCREEN TO SELF-DESTRUCT, AWARDING BONUS POINTS AND ADVANCING THE PLAYER(S) TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

THE BALL OCCASIONALLY SPLITS IN TWO (IN MULTIPLAYER GAMES, THREE BALLS MAY BE ON THE SCREEN AT ONCE), AND THE PLAYER CAN PUT SPIN ON THE BALL, CAUSING IT TO MOVE IN A CURVED TRAJECTORY. THE PLAYER LOSES A LIFE WHEN THE LAST BALL ON THE SCREEN MOVES PAST THE PLAYER'S PADDLE, THOUGH IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, THE GAME GIVES THE PLAYER A SECOND CHANCE. THE GAME IS OVER WHEN THE PLAYER HAS LOST ALL OF HIS OR HER LIVES.

AS LEVELS PROGRESS, THE GAME INTRODUCES NEW FEATURES THAT MAKE THE GAME MORE COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING. THESE FEATURES INCLUDE BLOCKS THAT MOVE RANDOMLY OR IN CIRCLES, VARIOUS POWERUPS, INDESTRUCTIBLE BLOCKS AND BOMBS, BLOCKS THAT PARACHUTE OR FLY IN TO REPLACE DESTROYED BLOCKS, OBJECTS THAT CHANGE THE BALL'S SPEED AND TRAJECTORY, AND GUNS THAT CAN SHRINK THE PLAYERS' PADDLES. DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS IN THE GAME, SOME LEVELS MAY BE SKIPPED DUE TO THE EXIT BEING ALONG ONE PLAYER'S EDGE OF THE PLAYFIELD. IN MULTIPLAYER GAMES, A BONUS ROUND OCCURS PERIODICALLY WHERE PLAYERS COMPETE DIRECTLY AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN AN EXACT CLONE OF PONG. THE WINNING PLAYER EARNS AN EXTRA LIFE.</desc>

		<desc>WHILE SIMILAR TO MOST VERTICAL SCROLLING SHOOTERS, OMEGA FIGHTER IS UNIQUE IN ITS GAMEPLAY, LEVEL AND ENEMY FOCUS: RATHER THAN FLYING THROUGH MULTIPLE LEVELS, THE PLAYER FACES AN ENORMOUS SPACE BATTLE CRUISER WHICH CONTAINS EVERY LEVEL.

THERE ARE TWO WEAPONS THAT THE PLAYER PICKS UP, AND IF THE PLAYER PICKS UP A DIFFERENT POWERUP, IT WILL ALWAYS RESET TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL:
(I) - ION LASER: SHOOTS STRAIGHT, PICK UP MORE TO INCREASE DAMAGE AT A COST OF DECREASING LENGTH. IDEAL FOR CLOSE COMBAT.
(W) - WIDE SHOT: SHOOTS BULLETS IN WIDER RANGE WHEN COLLECTING MORE OF THEM. IDEAL FOR TAKING ENEMIES FROM AFAR BUT DEALS LESS DAMAGE.

THERE ARE ALSO TWO ITEMS THAT ARE PRESSED BY THE BOMB BUTTON, AND PLAYERS MAY PICK UP TO TWO OF THEM:
SILVER - ACTIVATE TO SLOW DOWN EVERYTHING ON SCREEN. USEFUL TO DODGE BULLETS AND GETTING CLOSER FOR HIGHER SCORE.
GOLD - DESTROY ALL ENEMIES ON SCREEN, SCORE DEPENDS ON CLOSENESS TO PLAYER PRIOR TO USING THE ITEM.</desc>

PLAYERS MUST PILOT AN OMEGAN SPACE FIGHTER TO ENGAGE AND DESTROY THE ALIENS AND THE MINES THEY HAVE PLANTED. 

THE OMEGAN FIGHTER CAN ROTATE THROUGH 360 DEGREES AND THRUST TO MOVE FORWARDS, IT'S ALSO ARMED WITH FORWARD-FIRING LASERS WITH WHICH TO SHOOT THE ENEMY SHIPS. BATTLES TAKE PLACE IN AN ENCLOSED AREA AND WHEN THE PLAYER'S SHIP REACHES THE EDGE OF THE SCREEN IT BOUNCES OFF AN INVISIBLE BARRIER, ALTHOUGH THE BARRIER BRIEFLY APPEARS WHEN HIT OR SHOT. 

AS WELL AS FIRING LASERS AT THE PLAYER, SOME ENEMY SHIPS ALSO DROP MINES THAT MUST BE SHOT OR AVOIDED. AS PLAYERS PROGRESS THROUGH THE WAVES, THE NUMBER OF ENEMY ATTACKERS AND THEIR AGGRESSION INCREASES.</desc>

THE ESCAPING POWS FIGHT PRIMARILY USING HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT, BUT LIMITED-USE KNIVES AND SUB-MACHINE GUNS CAN BE RETRIEVED FROM FALLEN ENEMY SOLDIERS. THE GAME CONSISTS OF THREE ACTION BUTTONS FOR PUNCHING, KICKING AND JUMPING. THERE ARE ALSO THREE SPECIAL ATTACKS PERFORMED BY PRESSING TWO BUTTONS SIMULTANEOUSLY: A JUMP KICK (JUMP, THEN KICK), A BACK PUNCH (JUMP AND PUNCH SIMULTANEOUSLY) AND A HEADBUTT (PUNCH AND KICK SIMULTANEOUSLY).

THE CONTROLS CHANGE WHEN WIELDING A WEAPON; THE KNIFE IS THROWN BY PRESSING THE PUNCH BUTTON, BUT CAN PRESERVED BY USING KICKS. WHEN WIELDING THE MACHINE GUN, PLAYERS CAN FIRE IT BY PRESSING THE KICK BUTTON, OR CAN CONSERVE ITS AMMO BY PRESSING THE PUNCH BUTTON TO GUN-WHIP ENEMIES FROM CLOSE-RANGE.</desc>

THIS MEANS ELIMINATING AS MANY AIR AND GROUND UNITS AS YOU CAN. YOU WILL BE GOING THROUGH FOUR MISSIONS (EACH BEING BROKEN UP INTO TWO PARTS) AND AT THE END OF EACH OF THESE PARTS IS AN ENEMY BOSS FOR YOU TO TANGLE WITH. ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE UNLIMITED AMMUNITION, THE ENEMY WILL MAKE YOU PAY FOR THE INVASION INTO THEIR HOMELAND. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WITH VARIOUS POWER-UPS AND ALSO A SECOND PLAYER (IF THEY BUY IN). YOUR MISSION WON'T BE EASY BUT IT IS NECESSARY SO YOU CAN SECURE BOTH THE SKIES AND GROUND FOR OUR TROOPS.

THE GAME IS BROKEN UP INTO FOUR MISSIONS. WITHIN THESE FOUR MISSIONS, THERE ARE 2 PARTS. ONE PART INVOLVES GOING OVER LAND AND THE OTHER PART HAS YOU EITHER GOING OVER WATER OR BEING UP IN THE AIR. REGARDLESS OF WHICH PART YOU ARE ON, YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE SAME BASIC THINGS. AFTER PART TWO OF MISSION FOUR, THE MISSIONS WILL REPEAT AGAIN WITH MISSION ONE.</desc>

		<desc>PAC-LAND IS A HORIZONTALLY-SCROLLING PLATFORM GAME SET IN THE CARTOON WORLD OF THE GAME'S TITLE. A FAIRY HAS LOST HER WAY AND NEEDS PAC-MAN TO HELP HER GET BACK TO HER HOME OF FAIRYLAND. PAC-MAN, WITH THE FAIRY SAFELY HIDDEN BENEATH HIS HAT, MUST RUN AND JUMP THROUGH THE COLOURFUL WORLD UNTIL HE REACHES AND ENTERS THE MAGICAL DOOR TO FAIRYLAND. UPON BEING RESCUED, THE FAIRY GIVES PAC-MAN A PAIR OF MAGICAL SHOES FOR HIS TRIP BACK HOME. THESE ENABLE HIM TO JUMP WHEREVER HE WANTS, WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A PLATFORM TO JUMP FROM. THIS EFFECTIVELY MEANS PAC-MAN CAN 'SKY-JUMP' BACK HOME IF HE SO WISHES.

DIRECTIONAL BUTTONS MAKE PAC-MAN WALK LEFT AND RIGHT AND IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE HIM RUN BY TAPPING THE DESIRED DIRECTIONAL BUTTON TWICE. PAC-MAN IS PURSUED BY HIS EVER-PRESENT ENEMIES IN THE FORM OF FIVE GHOSTS - PINKY, INKY, BLINKY, CLYDE AND SUE. PAC-MAN MUST AVOID THE GHOSTS AND OTHER DEADLY OBJECTS THAT POPULATE THE LEVELS. AS WITH PREVIOUS GAMES IN THE SERIES, A SMALL NUMBER OF 'POWERPILLS' APPEAR. EATING A POWERPILL MAKES PAC-MAN TEMPORARILY INVINCIBLE AND TURNS THE GHOSTS PURPLE AND VULNERABLE TO BEING EATEN. ON SOME STAGES, PAC-MAN MUST USE A SPRINGBOARD TO JUMP OVER LARGE PONDS BY LEAPING FROM THE SPRINGBOARD AND RAPIDLY MOVING LEFT AND RIGHT WHILE IN THE AIR.

THE GAME'S STAGES ARE CALLED 'TRIPS', WITH PLAYERS ABLE TO START ON ANY ONE OF THE FIRST FIVE. EACH TRIP MADE UP OF FOUR ROUNDS (THREE ROUNDS TO REACH FAIRYLAND AND ONE ROUND TO RETURN HOME) WITH A SHORT INTERVAL BETWEEN EACH ONE. THE OBJECTIVE IN ALL TRIPS IS TO GET THE FAIRY SAFELY BACK TO FAIRYLAND THEN RETURN HOME TO PAC-MAN'S FAMILY. THE MAJORITY OF THE TRIP INVOLVES MOVING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, AVOIDING VARIOUS OBSTACLES SUCH AS THE ENEMY GHOSTS, WATER SPURTS AND QUICKSAND TRAPS. THE JOURNEY HOME, HOWEVER, SCROLLS RIGHT TO LEFT.

EACH STAGE MUST BE COMPLETED WITHIN A SET TIME LIMIT AND IF THE PLAYER RUNS OUT OF TIME BEFORE FINISHING A ROUND, SUE (THE PURPLE GHOST) WILL SPEED UP CONSIDERABLY AND KILL PAC-MAN. AT THE END OF EACH ROUND, PLAYERS ARE AWARDED BONUS POINTS BASED ON HOW MUCH OF THE TIME LIMIT REMAINS. ON EACH STAGE, CHERRIES AND OTHER ITEMS CAN BE COLLECTED FOR EXTRA POINTS. THERE ARE A TOTAL OF 8 DIFFERENT TRIPS IN THE GAME, TOTALLING 32 LEVELS. AFTER THE 8TH TRIP, THE 9TH TRIP IS A REPEAT OF THE 5TH TRIP, WITH LEVEL 33 EFFECTIVELY BEING LEVEL 17, WITH AN INCREASED DIFFICULTY LEVEL.</desc>

O JOGADOR CONTROLA UM ENTREGADOR DE JORNAIS EM UMA BICICLETA AO LONGO DE UMA RUA SUBURBANA, QUE É EXIBIDO EM UMA CABINE COM VISÃO DE PERSPECTIVA (OU PROJEÇÃO OBLÍQUA). O JOGADOR TENTA ENTREGAR UMA SEMANA DE JORNAIS DIÁRIOS PARA ASSINANTES, TENTA TAMBÉM VANDALIZAR OS LARES DOS NÃO ASSINANTES E DEVE EVITAR OS PERIGOS AO LONGO DA RUA. OS ASSINANTES SÃO PERDIDOS POR FALTA DE ENTREGA OU POR DANOS EM SUAS CASAS, E PODEM SER RECUPERADOS APÓS UM PERFEITO DIA DE ENTREGA.

O JOGO COMEÇA COM UMA ESCOLHA DE UM DESTES NÍVEIS DE DIFICULDADE: EASY STREET, MIDDLE ROAD E HARD WAY. O OBJETO DO JOGO É ENTREGAR PERFEITAMENTE OS JORNAIS PARA ASSINANTES DURANTE UMA SEMANA INTEIRA E EVITAR A QUEDA (QUE CONTA COMO UMA DAS VIDAS DO JOGADOR) ANTES DE TERMINAR A SEMANA. O JOGO TEM A DURAÇÃO DE SETE DIAS NO JOGO, DE SEGUNDA A DOMINGO.

CONTROLANDO O ENTREGADOR COM O GUIDÃO, O JOGADOR TENTA ENTREGAR JORNAIS AOS ASSINANTES. CADA DIA COMEÇA POR MOSTRAR UMA VISÃO GERAL DA RUA INDICANDO ASSINANTES E NÃO-ASSINANTES. AS CASAS DOS ASSINANTES E AS DOS NÃO-ASSINANTES TAMBÉM SÃO FÁCEIS DE DISCERNIR NO PRÓPRIO NÍVEL: ESTAS SÃO ESCURAS, ENQUANTO AQUELAS TÊM CORES BRILHANTES.</desc>

		<name>Parodius DA!</name>
		<desc>PARODIUS DA! IS A HORIZONTALLY-SCROLLING SHOOT-EM-UP IN WHICH THE GREAT OCTOPUS HAS THREATENED EARTH. TO HELP PARODIUS SAVE THE PLANET, THE PLAYER AND HIS FRIENDS MUST BEGIN THEIR SEARCH ACROSS THE WORLD TO FIND THE ENEMY AND DESTROY HIM.   

PARODIUS DA! WAS CREATED AS A PARODY OF KONAMI'S OWN "GRADIUS" SERIES OF SHOOT-EM-UPS BUT ADOPTED A GRAPHICAL STYLE THAT WAS ENTIRELY ITS OWN; SOMETHING THAT BECOMES EVIDENT AT THE VERY START OF THE GAME WHEN PLAYERS CAN CHOSE TO PILOT EITHER A PENGUIN OR AN OCTOPUS RATHER THAT THE TRADITIONAL GRADIUS SHIP. 

PARODIUS RETAINS THE SELECTABLE WEAPONS SYSTEM OF "GRADIUS";  A 'POWER METER' AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN ENABLES PLAYERS TO 'BUY' WEAPONS AND UPGRADES USING CAPSULES LEFT BEHIND BY CERTAIN DESTROYED ENEMIES. EACH COLLECTED CAPSULE ADVANCES THE POWER METER BY ONE STEP. PLAYERS CAN ACTIVATE THE HIGHLIGHTED ITEM AT ANY POINT, AFTER WHICH THE POWER METER RESETS. FOR THIS GAME, PLAYERS CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO HAVE WEAPONS UPDATE AUTOMATICALLY, WITH THE GAME UPGRADING WEAPONS SIMPLY BY COLLECTING THE CAPSULES.

PARODIUS DA! ALSO ALLOWS PLAYERS TO PILOT ANY ONE OF FOUR DIFFERENT CHARACTERS: VIC VIPER (FROM GRADIUS/NEMESIS), OCTOPUS, TWINBEE AND PENTAROU. ANOTHER NEW ADDITION IS THAT OF BELL POWER-UPS. THESE ORIGINALLY APPEARED IN KONAMI'S "TWINBEE" SERIES AND ACT AS ONE-TIME POWER-UPS, ALLOWING THE PLAYER TO DESTROY EVERY ENEMY ON SCREEN, FOR EXAMPLE, OR FIRE HUGE ENERGY BEAMS. 

ENEMIES AND ENVIRONMENTS FROM THE GRADIUS GAMES AND TWINBEE ARE MIXED IN ALONG WITH A HOST OF ANIME-STYLE OPPONENTS, INCLUDING SCANTILY-CLAD WOMEN. PARODIUS' ECCENTRICITY AND UNIQUE HUMOUR IS FURTHER DEMONSTRATED SOON AFTER THE GAME BEGINS; AS PLAYERS FACE SUCH ENEMIES AS A GIANT BELLY-DANCING WOMAN AND A HALF-CAT/HALF-BOAT CREATURE.</desc>

THE IDEA IS TO DESTROY ALL OF THE ON-SCREEN ENEMIES; ONCE THIS A DONE, A CIRCULAR KEY WILL APPEAR; THE PLAYER MUST PICK THE KEY UP, WHEREUPON THEY WILL BE TELEPORTED TO ANOTHER SCREEN WHICH REPRESENTS THE SECOND PART OF THE STAGE. THIS SCREEN HAS A SILVER DOORWAY; THE PLAYER MUST CARRY THE KEY TO THE DOOR - AVOIDING OR DESTROYING THE ON-SCREEN ENEMIES - TO COMPLETE THE LEVEL.</desc>

		<name>Pepper II</name>
		<desc>DESPITE ITS NAME, THERE WAS NO PREDECESSOR NAMED PEPPER OR PEPPER I. THE GAMEPLAY IS SIMILAR TO THE GAME AMIDAR BY KONAMI AND STERN.

THERE ARE FOUR MAZES PER LEVEL IN PEPPER II. EACH MAZE HAS EXITS LEADING TO 3 OTHER MAZES. ALL FOUR MAZES MUST BE FILLED TO ADVANCE TO THE NEXT LEVEL. TO FILL IN A MAZE, THE PLAYER MANEUVERS "PEPPER" AROUND DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE MAZE. AS PEPPER TRAVELS, HE LEAVES A "ZIPPER". ONCE HE ENCLOSES OR "ZIPS" A SEGMENT, IT FILLS IN AND POINTS ARE AWARDED. IF PEPPER BACKTRACKS ON AN UNCOMPLETED SEGMENT, IT UNZIPS.

THE CHARACTER "PEPPER" IS AN ANGEL. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF ENEMIES THAT MUST BE AVOIDED: "ROAMING EYES" AND THE " WHIPPERSNAPPER" WHO UNZIPS ALL UNCOMPLETED, ZIPPED SEGMENTS BY MOVING OVER THEM. PEPPER'S ONE DEFENSE IS TO ENCLOSE AN AREA CONTAINING A PITCHFORK "ENERGIZER", WHICH TURNS HIM INTO A DEVIL FOR APPROXIMATELY FOUR SECONDS. AT THAT TIME HE CAN GO AFTER ALL ROAMING EYES FOR POINTS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE WHIPPERSNAPPER FREEZES. THERE ARE FOUR PITCHFORKS IN THE CORNERS OF EVERY MAZE. A DELUXE ENERGIZER IS LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF EACH MAZE. THIS ENERGIZER ALTERNATES BETWEEN BEING A PITCHFORK AND A HALO SYMBOL. IF PEPPER ENCLOSES THE MIDDLE AREA WHEN THE ENERGIZER IS A HALO, THE WHIPPERSNAPPER WILL DISAPPEAR FROM THE MAZE.

POINTS ARE MADE FOR ENCLOSING A SEGMENT, CONSUMING A PAIR OF ROAMING EYES WHEN ENERGIZED BY THE PITCHFORK (SIMILAR TO PAC-MAN), OBTAINING PRIZES, COMPLETING A MAZE, AND COMPLETING 4 MAZES. A BONUS TURN IS AWARDED AT 40,000, 50,000, 70,000 OR 90,000 POINTS, DEPENDING ON THE DIP SWITCH SETTINGS.

EACH MAZE ALSO CONTAINS A PRIZE IN ONE OF THE SEGMENTS. THE PLAYER MUST ENCLOSE THE AREA IT APPEARS IN TO GAIN THE PRIZE AND POINTS, AND THEN THE PRIZE IS SHOWN BENEATH THE MAZE.</desc>

FLYING ANIMALS THAT HAVE BEEN STUNNED CAN BE RIDDEN AROUND THE SCREEN FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. A ROUND ENDS WHEN ALL THE DESIRED OBJECTS HAVE BEEN COLLECTED AND PLACED IN THE NEST. SUCCESSIVE ROUNDS ADD MORE OBJECTS AND ENEMIES, AS WELL AS CHANGING THE PATTERNS OF THE SHORTCUTS.</desc>

SHOOT ALL ENEMIES LIKE HARPIES AND SKELETONS ALONG WITH GOBLINS AND COLOSSAL ENEMY BOSSES.

PRESSING THE FIRE BUTTON MAKES HIS SWORD FIRE A TINY SHOT, WHILE HOLDING IT DOWN CHARGES THE SWORD, FIRING A BIGGER FIREBALL UPON RELEASE. EVEN THE SMALLEST ENEMIES TAKE MULTIPLE HITS, SO THE STANDARD SHOT IS OF LITTLE USE.</desc>

		<desc>PHOZON IS AN UNUSUAL PUZZLE/ARCADE HYBRID IN WHICH THE PLAYER CONTROLS A BLACK MOLECULE WITH FOUR RED SPIKES. THE IDEA IS FOR THE PLAYER TO ALIGN OTHER FLOATING MOLECULES ONTO THEIR OWN MOLECULE TO CREATE AN INCREASINGLY COMPLEX PATTERN; THIS MUST MATCH THE "BLUE PRINT" MOLECULE THAT IS SITUATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN. TO MAKE MOLECULES ADHERE TO THE PLAYER'S MOLECULE, THE PLAYER SIMPLY TOUCHES THE TARGET MOLECULE WITH THEIR OWN. IF A MOLECULE ATTACHES IN A PLACE THAT DOES NOT FIT THE PATTERN SHOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN, THE PLAYER MUST PRESS THE REJECT BUTTON TO MAKE IF FLOAT AWAY. GROUPS OF MULTI-COLOURED ROTATING SPHERES MOVE AROUND THE SCREEN AND MUST BE AVOIDED.</desc>

		<desc>THE PLAYER USES THE JOYSTICK TO MOVE THE RED PIRATE SHIP ACROSS THE ISLANDS TO SCORE POINTS: SMALL ISLANDS (25 POINTS), MEDIUM ISLANDS (100 POINTS), BIG ISLANDS (150 POINTS), AND GREAT BIG ISLANDS (250 POINTS). AVOID COLLIDING WITH THE BLACK ENEMY PIRATE SHIP AND BE AWARE THAT THIS SHIP CAN ALSO CREATE A LIVE VOLCANO ON ONE OF THE ISLANDS YOU RAIDED. IF YOU RUN INTO A VOLCANO, YOUR SHIP WILL EXPLODE.

TRY TO CAPTURE THE TREASURE CHEST WHEN YOU SEE IT ON ONE OF THE ISLANDS BUT SOMETIMES THE ENEMY SHIP WILL TAKE IT AND MOVE IT ONTO ANOTHER ISLAND. YOUR SHIP CAN SOMETIMES MOVE THROUGH THE TOP, BOTTOM AND SIDES OF THE SCREEN BUT AT OTHER TIMES THE EDGES OF THE SCREEN WILL BE BLOCKED BY RED LINES. EVERYTIME YOU CAPTURE ONE OF THE TREASURES, DEPENDING ON WHAT STAGE YOU ARE ON, THE PRIZE CAN BE WORTH FROM 1000 TO 7000 POINTS PLUS A BONUS FOR EVERY ISLAND YOU RAID AFTER YOU HAVE CAPTURED THE TREASURE.

THERE ARE SEVEN DIFFERENT STAGES WHERE YOU MUST STEAL A TREASURE FROM ONE OF THE INFAMOUS PIRATES INCLUDING CAPTAIN HOOK, CAPTAIN KIDD, BLACKBEARD, LONG JOHN SILVER, JOLLY ROGER, PEGLEG PETE, AND THE MAD HACKERS. AFTER ALL SEVEN TREASURES HAVE BEEN CAPTURED, THERE IS AN INTERMISSION WHERE AN EYE-PATCHED SKULL AND CROSSBONES WINKS AND GRINS AND IT SAYS "YAR! HAR! HAR! HAR! DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES!" AFTER THAT, THE STAGES START ALL OVER AGAIN, BUT WITH INCREASED DIFFICULTY. YOU HAVE THREE SHIPS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME AND YOU ARE REWARDED AN EXTRA SHIP AT 90,000 POINTS.</desc>

		<desc>ON STAGE 1, YOU CAN IGNORE AS MANY YELLOW SHIPS AS POSSIBLE, AND ONLY AIM FOR THE BLUE ONES. WHEN THE YELLOW ONES MOVE OFF SCREEN THERE IS OFTEN A CHANCE THAT THE NEXT WAVE WILL INCLUDE A BLUE SHIP. SINCE THE BLUE SHIPS ARE WORTH MORE POINTS THEY ARE WORTH WAITING FOR.
ON STAGE 2 THE BIRDS DO NOT FIRE UNTIL THEY ARE FULLY DEVELOPED. YOU CAN USUALLY TAKE OUT 3 OR 4 OF THEM BEFORE THEY START FIRING.
ON STAGE 2 YOU CAN CONCENTRATE ON CONTINUAL FIRE ON BIRDS WINGS WHEN THERE ARE ONLY 2 OR 3 REMAINING, AS THIS AWARDS 20 POINTS PER HIT AND DOES NOT DESTROY THE BIRD. YOU CAN RACK UP A GOOD SCORE BY DOING THIS, BUT WATCH OUT FOR THE FALLING BULLETS.
THE ASTEROIDS POSITIONING ON THE DOCKING STAGE IS TOTALLY RANDOM, SO THIS STAGE IS OFTEN DOWN TO CHANCE. DO NOT USE YOUR THRUSTERS TO MAXIMIZE YOUR BONUS POINTS.
ON STAGE 4, THE SHIPS WHICH COME DOWN FROM THE CLOUD MOVE ACROSS YOU FROM LEFT TO RIGHT AND BACK AGAIN. YOU CAN TIME YOUR FIRING SO THAT THEY ARE HIT WHEN DIRECTLY ABOVE YOU.

		<name>Pleiads</name>
		<desc>PLEIADS IS A 2-D, SPACE SHOOTER STYLE GAME. WITH ITS MANY INTERESTING VISUAL AND AUDIO EFFECTS, THIS GAME IS SURE TO CHALLENGE THE MOST AVID PLAYER.

EACH ROUND OF PLAY INCLUDES 4 DIFFERENT STAGES. WITH THE ONSET OF THE MELODIOUS BACKGROUND TUNE, THE FIRST STAGE OF PLAY BEGINS.

AGAINST A BACKDROP OF PLANETS AND TWINKLING STARS, THE EARTH CITY MUST BE PROTECTED FROM SIXTEEN ATTACKING MARTIANS. THESE MARTIAN ATTACKERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRANSFORM FROM FLYING MARTIANS, TO WALKING MARTIANS, OR TO UFOS. THE WALKING MARTIANS BUILD BARRIERS ACROSS THE EARTH CITY. THESE BARRIERS MUST BE DESTROYED.

THE EARTH SPACESHIP CAN BE MANEUVERED RIGHT AND LEFT. WITH THE USE OF THE 'WARP' BUTTON, IT CAN BE RANDOMLY RELOCATED WHEN NECESSARY. THESE, PLUS A BACKUP OF STATIONARY DEFENSE WEAPONS, AID IN PROTECTING THE EARTH CITY AND SPACESHIP, AS WELL AS IN DESTROYING THE MARTIAN ATTACKERS. WHEN ALL BUT THE TWO FINAL MARTIANS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, A TONE OF DUSK SHADES THE EARTH CITY. AS THESE TWO ATTACKERS MEET THEIR END, THE EARTH SPACESHIP ASCENDS INTO SPACE TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF STAGE II.

IN THIS SECOND STAGE OF PLAY, THE EARTH SPACESHIP ENCOUNTERS EIGHT SPACE MONSTERS. TO DESTROY THESE MONSTERS, THEY MUST BE HIT IN THE DIRECT CENTER. WHEN A SPACE MONSTER WITH BURNING WINGS IS DESTROYED, UP TO 400 POINTS CAN BE ADDED TO YOUR SCORE. WHEN ALL THE SPACE MONSTERS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, THE EARTH SPACESHIP PREPARES FOR STAGE III.

IN THIS THIRD STAGE OF PLAY, THE EARTH SPACESHIP IS CONFRONTED WITH THE MARTIAN SPACE BATTLESHIP AND ITS UNSEEN FORCES. THIS MARTIAN BATTLESHIP CONTAINS FIVE CLOSED CHAMBERS, EACH PROTECTED BY A ROCKET FLAME. EACH CHAMBER OPENS PERIODICALLY AT RANDOM, TO RELEASE A DEFENDING RESERVE OF MARTIAN ATTACKERS. WHEN A FLAME BELOW AN OPEN CHAMBER IS EXTINGUISHED, POINT VALUE OF THE MARTIAN SPACE BATTLESHIP INCREASES. THIS ENEMY SHIP CAN BE DESTROYED BY EITHER ELIMINATING ALL SIXTEEN MARTIAN ATTACKERS, OR BY EXTINGUISHING ALL FIVE ROCKET FLAMES. WHEN THE MARTIAN SPACE BATTLESHIP FINALLY EXPLODES, THE EARTH SPACESHIP MOVES ON TO STAGE IV.

THIS LAST STAGE OF PLAY BEGINS WITH AN EMERGENCY SIGNAL, SOS, SOS, SOS, AT ONCE RETURN TO EARTH. THE EARTH SPACESHIP IS NOW READY TO BE GUIDED ON ITS JOURNEY, THROUGH A LANDING CORRIDOR, BACK TO ITS HOME BASE. THE EARTH SPACESHIP MUST BE CAREFULLY MANEUVERED AROUND OTHER SPACESHIPS IN ORDER TO AVOID DESTRUCTION. CLEARING FLAGS WILL ADD BONUS POINTS TO YOUR SCORE. WHEN THE EARTH SPACESHIP HAS BEEN SAFELY MANEUVERED TO ITS ARRIVAL TARGET, 500 TO 4,000 POINTS WILL BE ADDED TO YOUR SCORE, WHILE BURSTS OF FIREWORKS GREET YOUR ARRIVAL AND SIGNAL THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ROUND OF PLAY.</desc>

COLLECTING THESE GEMS WILL 'POWER-UP' THE PLAYER'S CHARACTER, GIVING THEM MORE POWERFUL ATTACKS. THERE ARE TWO BARS AND THREE SUB-BARS IN THE INTERFACE. THE TWO MAIN BARS ARE THE LIFE BAR AND THE SUPER BAR; THE FIRST INDICATES THE PLAYER'S HEALTH AND THE SECOND THEIR ABILITY TO THROW SUPER COMBOS. THE SUPER BAR ITSELF CAN BE FILLED UP TO NINE LEVELS, ALLOWING PLAYERS TO EXECUTE MORE SUPER COMBOS. EACH SUPER COMBO HAS A LEVEL ASSIGNED TO IT, AND IT USES SUPER BARS DEPENDING ON IT.</desc>

		<desc>PREHISTORIC ISLE IN 1930 IS A HORIZONTALLY SCROLLING SHOOTING GAME DEVELOPED BY SNK AND RELEASED IN ARCADES IN 1989. 

SHIPS HAVE BEEN MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARING IN THE VICINITY OF THE BAHAMAS FOR YEARS. NOW, IN 1930, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SENDS AN EXPEDITION TO THE AREA IN A FLYING BOAT TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE. AS THEY SURVEY THE OCEAN, THE EXPEDITION COMES ACROSS AN UNCHARTED LANDMASS WHICH THEY DUB "GREENHELL ISLE" AND LAUNCHES TWO RECONNAISSANCE BIPLANES TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. AS THEY INVESTIGATE THE ISLAND, THE BIPLANES COME UNDER ATTACK BY DINOSAURS AND OTHER LIFE FORMS THAT WERE THOUGHT TO HAVE BECOME EXTINCT MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO. 

THE PLAYER TAKES CONTROL OF A BIPLANE ARMED WITH A FORWARD-FIRING MACHINE GUN. IT CAN ALSO BE EQUIPPED WITH AN OPTION WEAPON POD THAT CAN BE ROTATED CLOCKWISE AROUND THE CRAFT. THE OPTION'S ATTACK CHANGES DEPENDING ON WHERE IT IS CURRENTLY POSITIONED:

WHEN DIRECTLY ABOVE OR BELOW THE PLANE, THE OPTION FIRES ENERGY WAVES THAT REFLECT BACK UPON CONTACT WITH A SURFACE.
WHEN DIAGONALLY ABOVE THE PLANE, THE OPTION FIRES BALLS OF ENERGY THAT BOUNCE OFF SURFACES AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE.
WHEN DIAGONALLY BELOW THE PLANE, THE OPTION DROPS BOMBS.
WHEN DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE PLANE, THE OPTION REPLACES THE DEFAULT MACHINE GUN WITH ITS OWN FLAME CANNON.
WHEN DIRECTLY BEHIND THE PLANE, THE OPTION DEPLOYS AERIAL MINES.</desc>

ONE OF THEM WAS A PROPELLER THAT EVOLVED FROM PURE WIND GENERATION BY USING THE CREATED ELECTRICITY TO RE-ROTATE IT. IT WAS CALLED 'THE PROFESSIONAL GEAR', OR JUST 'PROGEAR'. THIS INVENTION WAS THE KEY TO CONQUER THE GREAT WIDE OPEN SKY. ANOTHER DISCOVERY MADE THE ANCIENT DREAM OF THE IMMORTAL BODY COME TRUE. BUT IT WAS AFFORDABLE ONLY BY SOME WEALTHY ELDERLY. THEY FORMED A NEW COUNCIL CALLED 'THE MOTOROUIN' AND DECLARED THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT AS A CORRUPTIVE AND GREEDY ESTABLISHMENT AND THAT THEY WANT TO CORRECT IT BY A NEW EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, IN ORDER TO CREATE A NEW RACE OF MAN. SO THEY BUILT A MILITARY FORCE TO REALIZE THE FIRST STEP OF THEIR PLAN, WHICH WAS THE TAKEOVER OF THE KINGDOM. THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO STOP THE AGGRESSION BY PUTTING IT'S OWN ARMY IN MOTION. IT WAS A DREADFUL BATTLE WITH MANY VICTIMS. BUT IT WAS WON BY THE MOTOROUIN. THIS BATTLE IS MENTIONED IN THE BOOKS OF HISTORY AS 'THE PUNISHMENT OF THE SAGES'.

A GROUP OF YOUNG PILOTS, ACTUALLY CHILDREN WHOSE FAMILIES WERE KILLED IN THAT WAR, FINALLY DECIDED TO FIGHT BACK. THEY SECRETLY DEVELOPED A NEW POWERFUL WEAPON WHICH ADULTS WERE NOT ABLE TO USE. THEY CALLED IT 'GUN FLYER' AND INSTALLED IT IN ALL OF THEIR PLANES. THE STORM OF PROGEAR WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN!</desc>

		<desc>UO POKO IS A PUZZLE GAME FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS (CO-OPERATIVE). THE AIM IS TO CLEAR THE SCREEN OF COLOURED GLASS BALLS BY DROPPING LIKE-COLOURED BALLS DOWN ONTO THEM. CONNECTING THREE OR MORE LIKE-COLOURED BALLS CREATES A CHAIN REACTION AND CAUSES THEM TO DISAPPEAR.

BALLS ARE LAUNCHED INTO THE PLAY AREA VIA A JOYSTICK CONTROLLED 'PINBALL-PLUNGER' AND AS IN PINBALL, THE FURTHER THE PLUNGER IS PULLED BACK, THE FURTHER THE COLOURED BALL WILL TRAVEL. MASTERING THE STRENGTH AND DISTANCE REQUIRED IS ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO DROP EACH BALL ACCURATELY ONTO ITS TARGET. TO ALLOW PLAYERS TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE PLUNGER, THE FIRST TWO STAGES FEATURE A GUIDE LINE WHICH SHOWS EXACTLY WHERE A BALL WILL DROP. FROM THE THIRD STAGE ONWARDS, PLAYERS MUST USE THEIR JUDGEMENT ALONE.

BONUS POINTS ARE AWARDED IF A STAGE IS COMPLETED QUICKLY ENOUGH. IF TOO MUCH TIME IS TAKEN, HOWEVER, THE BOTTOM OF THE STAGE WILL START TO RISE, PUSHING THE BALLS ALREADY IN PLAY TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. IF THE TOP OF THE SCREEN IS REACHED, THE GAME IS OVER.

UO POKO FEATURES THIRTY STAGES OF PLAY.</desc>

		<desc>THE OBJECTIVE OF QIX IS TO CLAIM A CERTAIN PROPORTION OF THE PLAYING FIELD AS YOUR OWN. AT THE START OF EACH LEVEL, THE PLAYING FIELD IS JUST A LARGE, EMPTY RECTANGLE, CONTAINING THE QIX - A STICK-LIKE ENTITY THAT PERFORMS PECULIAR, ERRATIC MOTIONS WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE RECTANGLE. THE PLAYER CONTROLS A SMALL MARKER THAT CAN MOVE AROUND THE EDGES OF THE RECTANGLE. TO CLAIM AN AREA OF THE SCREEN, THE PLAYER MUST DETACH FROM AN EDGE AND DRAW STIX WITHIN THE RECTANGLE. STIX ARE SIMPLY LINES TRACED OUT BY MOVING THE MARKER. WHEN THE MARKER TRACES OUT A CLOSED SHAPE, THE AREA ENCLOSED BY THE SHAPE BECOMES SOLID AND HAS BEEN CLAIMED. THE PLAYER MAY DRAW EITHER FAST STIX, WHICH APPEAR BLUE WHEN SOLID, OR SLOW STIX, WHICH APPEAR RED. SLOW STIX TAKE LONGER TO DRAW, BUT ARE WORTH TWICE AS MANY POINTS. ONCE THE PLAYER HAS CLAIMED AN AREA, THE MARKER CAN SAFELY MOVE ALONG THE BORDER OF THAT CLAIMED AREA. TO COMPLETE A LEVEL, THE PLAYER MUST CLAIM 75% OR MORE OF THE RECTANGLE'S AREA.</desc>

		<desc>QUANTUM IS A REFLEX-BASED VECTOR GAME SET IN THE SUB-ATOMIC WORLD OF QUANTUM PHYSICS, IN WHICH THE PLAYER CONTROLS A PROBE (OR 'SPARKLER') AND MUST FULLY ENCIRCLE ATOMIC PARTICLES FOR POINTS WITHOUT TOUCHING VARIOUS OTHER PARTICLES. ONCE THE PARTICLES ARE SURROUNDED BY THE PROBE'S TAIL THEY ARE DESTROYED.

THE GAME FEATURES NUMEROUS PARTICLE TYPES THAT MUST BE ENCIRCLED AND DESTROYED OR AVOIDED. FIRST, THERE ARE NUCLEI AROUND WHICH ELECTRONS ORBIT. WHEN A NUCLEUS IS ENCIRCLED (SNARED) AND EXPLODES, THE ELECTRONS CHANGE INTO POSITRONS WHICH, IF THEY ARE ENCIRCLED BEFORE FLYING OFF THE SCREEN, ARE WORTH EXTRA POINTS.

AS PLAY PROGRESSES, PULSARS APPEAR. THESE TRAVEL TOWARDS THE PLAYER'S PROBE, PULSATING THEIR ARMS IN AND OUT AS THEY MOVE. THE PROBE IS DESTROYED IF IT MAKES CONTACT WITH ANY PART OF A PULSAR. OTHER DEADLY PARTICLES INCLUDE TRIANGULAR PHOTONS, SELF-DEVIDING SPLITTERS AND DIAMOND-SHAPED TRIPHONS.

IN LATER STAGES, THE NUCLEI JOIN TOGETHER, FORMING BONDS. THE PLAYER'S PROBE IS DESTROYED IF IT CROSSES THE BONDS WHEN THEY ARE RED, BUT CAN SAFELY CROSS WHEN THEY ARE YELLOW.</desc>

		<desc>AS CAPTAIN OF THE SONIC SPACEPORT, PLAYERS MUST DEFEND THEIR STATION AGAINST ENEMY SPACESHIPS CALLED GAMMA RAIDERS, WHICH ATTACK WITH VENGEANCE AND SWIFTLY RETREAT TO FORMATION. THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO DESTROY 48 ENEMY GAMMA RAIDERS BEFORE THERE IS TOTAL DISINTEGRATION OF ALL THE SPACEPORTS ON THE PLAYER'S SIDE.

PLAYERS CAN COUNTERATTACK WITH THE RAPID-FIRE LASER BLASTER WHICH ZOOMS THE LASERS OVER THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL-ESQUE FIELD OF CURVING VECTORS, WHILE IT INTERCEPTS ENEMIES. THE LOWER ON THE RADAR SCREEN THAT YOU DESTROY A GAMMA RAIDER, THE MORE POINTS WILL BE EARNED. IF EXPLODING DECOYS DAMAGE THE SONIC SPACEPORT, THE LASER BLASTER'S FIRING SPEED WILL REDUCE. THE LASER BLASTER'S "DAMAGE METER" WILL LIGHT UP AS DAMAGE IS INCURRED AND WHEN FULLY ILLUMINATED, WILL WEAKEN THE LASER BLASTER'S OFFENSIVE POWERS. TO REVERSE THIS, THE PLAYERS MUST ATTACK AND DESTROY ALL REMAINING GAMMA RAIDERS.

PLAYERS ARE GIVEN A WIDE RANGE OF FLEXIBILITY IN CONTROLLING THE DIFFICULTY LEVELS OF THE GAME. EXTRA SPACEPORTS ARE AWARDED AT 7,000, 10,000, 15,000 AND 20,000 POINTS, AS DETERMINED BY THE PLAYERS. THE INITIAL NUMBER OF SPACEPORTS MAY ALSO BE PRE-PROGRAMMED AT 3, 4, 5 OR 6. WHEN THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF SPACESHIPS IS DESTROYED, PLAYERS RECEIVE AN EXTRA POINT BONUS.</desc>

		<desc>SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE, SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED A DIAMOND-SHAPED ALIEN DEVICE DEEP IN SPACE. THE MYSTERIOUS ALIEN DEVICE DETONATES WHILE BEING PROBED, STARTING A CHAIN REACTION WHICH DESTROYS THE ENTIRE PLANET. FORTUNATELY, THERE'S A GROUP OF SLAP-HAPPY SPACE CADETS WHO ARE UP IN ORBIT WHO AREN'T AFFECTED BY THE EXPLOSION, BUT WITNESS IT, SO THEY DECIDE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT - WHICH MEANS FINDING A WAY TO TRAVEL BACK IN TIME TO AVERT THE CATASTROPHE BEFORE IT HAPPENS!

RADIANT SILVERGUN IS A VERTICALLY SCROLLING SHOOT-EM-UP RENDERED WITH A SUPERB MIX OF 2 &amp; 3-D GRAPHICS, AND IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE THE FINEST EVER GAME OF ITS TYPE IN WHAT IS A VERY CROWDED GENRE.

PART OF THE REASON FOR THE GAME'S HUGE SUCCESS IS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS WEAPONS SYSTEM. UNLIKE OTHER SHOOT-EM-UPS, ALL OF THE GAME'S WEAPONS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE PLAYER FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. SILVERGUN'S CONTROL PANEL CONSISTS OF 3 DIFFERENT FIRE BUTTONS, EACH OF WHICH ACTIVATES A DIFFERENT WEAPON; EITHER 'VULCAN', 'HOMING' OR 'SPREAD'. IN ADDITION, PLAYERS CAN ACTIVATE 4 EXTRA WEAPONS USING A COMBINATION OF THE T3 FIRE BUTTONS. THESE ARE:

A + B = HOMING PLASMA 
A + C = BACKWARDS WIDE SHOT 
B + C = HOMING SPREAD 
A + B + C = RADIANT SWORD

AT THE START OF A GAME, THE PLAYER'S WEAPONS ARE VERY WEAK, BUT THEY CAN BE 'POWERED-UP' BY SHOOTING SAME-COLOURED ENEMIES (CHAINING), IN A FASHION SIMILAR TO GAINING EXPERIENCE FOR A WEAPON IN A ROLE PLAYING GAME.</desc>

		<desc>THIS IS AN INTERESTING TAKE ON THE SHOOTER GENRE, WITH THREE UNIQUE SECTIONS IN EACH STAGE. YOU CONTROL A TIRE WITH THE ABILITY TO JUMP AND SHOOT. WHEN YOU JUMP, YOU CAN ONLY BE HIT BY THE ENEMIES IN THE FIRST STAGE.

IN THE FIRST LEVEL, YOU NEED TO DODGE OR JUMP OVER ROCKS AS BAT-LIKE ENEMIES RUSH DOWN THE SCREEN, WEAVING ACROSS IT. OCCASIONALLY A STRING OF ENEMIES WILL APPEAR THAT GIVE A BONUS OF 1000 IF YOU HIT THEM ALL. YOU CAN ALSO PICK UP BONUS ITEMS WORTH 300 POINTS EACH.

IN THE SECOND LEVEL, YOU ARE DRIVING DOWN A BUSY ROAD. YOU NEED TO DOGE CARS AS THEY ERRATICALLY MOVE ACROSS THE SCREEN. OCCASIONALLY AN AMBULANCE WILL DRIVE UP THE SCREEN, AND IF IT HITS A VEHICLE IT WILL GO FLYING ACROSS THE SCREEN. WATCH OUT FOR THE BLUE TRUCKS IN THIS SECTION. MIDWAY THROUGH THIS PART, A GREEN TRUCK APPEARS WHICH DROPS STARS. THEY ARE WORTH 500 EACH. THERE ARE BROKEN DOWN VEHICLES ON THE ROAD, ALONG WITH OIL SLICKS. THE PICKUPS WORTH 300 POINTS MAKE A RETURN.

THE THIRD LEVEL IS A BONUS ROUND. YOU CONTINUE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD, BUT NOW THERE ARE ONLY OIL SLICKS. YOU NEED TO COLLECT AS MANY POINT PICKUPS AS POSSIBLE. IF YOU DIE IN THIS SECTION, IT JUMPS TO THE NEXT LEVEL, AND YOU DO NOT LOSE A LIFE. YOU GET A BONUS IF YOU GET EVERY PICKUP. YOU ARE THEN GIVEN A BONUS BASED ON YOUR TIME FOR THE LAST STAGE.

THERE IS A DIFFICULTY SPIKE AT THE THIRD STAGE. THE EXTRA LIFE IS AT 50000. YOU ONLY GET ONE EXTRA LIFE DURING THE COURSE OF THE GAME. THE GAME IS INFINITE.</desc>

		<desc>RAMPAGE IS A CLASSIC B-MOVIE INSPIRED SMASH-EM-UP IN WHICH UP TO THREE PLAYERS TAKE ON THE ROLES OF THREE MUTATED MONSTERS - GEORGE THE GIANT APE, LIZZIE THE GIANT LIZARD AND RALPH THE GIANT WOLF - WHO MOVE FROM CITY TO CITY DESTROYING SKYSCRAPERS AND VEHICLES, WHILE EATING OR KILLING ANY PEOPLE THAT GET IN THEIR WAY. 

THE MONSTERS' HEALTH CAN BE DAMAGED IN A NUMBER OF WAYS: BY BEING SHOT BY NATIONAL GUARDSMEN, BY BEING HIT BY ANOTHER MONSTER, BY FALLING FROM A BUILDING, BY BEING HIT BY POLICE CARS OR TANKS, BY GOING UNDERWATER, BY BEING STRUCK BY LIGHTNING, OR BY EATING SOMETHING BAD, SUCH AS DYNAMITE. HEALTH IS REPLENISHED BY EATING FOOD FOUND IN DAMAGED BUILDINGS. 

IF THE PLAYERS' HEALTH GAUGE DIMINISHES COMPLETELY, THE MONSTERS WILL REVERT BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL HUMAN FORM AND WALK SIDEWAYS OFF THE SCREEN. RAMPAGE HAS A "BUY BACK IN" OPTION, HOWEVER; IF PLAYERS CHOSE TO CONTINUE THE GAME BEFORE THE HUMAN FIGURE LEAVES THE PLAY AREA, THE GAME WILL CONTINUE FROM THAT STAGE. 

RAMPAGE IS SET OVER THE COURSE OF 128 DAYS IN CITIES ACROSS NORTH AMERICA. THE GAME STARTS IN PEORIA, ILLINOIS AND ENDS IN PLANO, ILLINOIS. IN PLANO, PLAYERS RECEIVE A MEGA VITAMIN BONUS WHICH HEALS ALL THE MONSTERS AND PROVIDES A LARGE POINT BONUS. AFTER THIS, THE CYCLE OF CITIES REPEATS FIVE TIMES. AFTER 768 DAYS, THE GAME RESETS BACK TO DAY ONE. 

EXAMPLES OF BONUSES AND HAZARDS FOUND INSIDE DAMAGED BUILDINGS: 
FOOD: MILK, TURKEY, HOT TOAST, FRUIT 
BONUS: FLOWER POT, TV SET, MONEY BAG 
HAZARD: CACTUS, POISON, TOASTER 

EXAMPLES OF BONUSES AND HAZARDS FOUND OUTSIDE DAMAGED BUILDINGS: 
BONUS: AUTO (OR TRUCK), COMMUTER TRAIN, PERSON IN MANHOLE 
HAZARD: NATIONAL GUARD TANK, POLICE CAR, STORM CLOUD 

FURTHER BONUS POINTS CAN BE EARNED BY GRABBING A FLEEING 'TOWNIE' FROM A BUILDING WINDOW. THIS HAS TWO BENEFITS: 1) WHILE HOLDING THE TOWNIE, ALL SWAT TEAM MEMBERS DISAPPEAR FROM THE BUILDING WINDOWS AND 2) ACCUMULATING POINTS ARE SCORED DURING THE TIME THE TOWNIE IS HELD.</desc>

GRAPHICS ARE MUCH IMPROVED AND A KICK BUTTON HAS BEEN ADDED TO ALLOW EVEN MORE CHAOS.

HIDDEN BONUS ITEMS HAVE ALSO BEEN ADDED TO THE GAME; TWO EXAMPLES ARE AN ITEM THAT ALLOWS ANY PLAYER CHARACTER TO TRANSPORT TO ALMOST ANY LOCATION IN THE GAME INSTANTLY. A SECOND GIVES THE PLAYERS MORE DESTRUCTIVE POWER. SOME STAGES HAVE A VAT OF TOXIC CHEMICALS THAT CAN MUTATE ANY PLAYER CHARACTER INTO A HUGE PURPLE BAT-LIKE CREATURE CALLED V.E.R.N (VIOLENTLY ENRAGED RADIOACTIVE NEMESIS) FOR THE DURATION OF THE STAGE.</desc>

		<desc>RAY STORM IS A SEQUEL OF RAYFORCE THAT DOES NOT FOLLOW THE MAIN PLOT "CON-HUMAN" STORYLINE, TO THIS TIME THE PLOT CONSISTS OF EIGHT STAGES TAKING PLACE BETWEEN AUGUST 4 AND AUGUST 7, 2219 AD; THE FIRST THREE STAGES TAKE PLACE ON EARTH, THE LAST THREE AT THE FICTIONAL PLANET SECILIA, AND TWO BETWEEN THEM IN THE ORBITS OF EARTH AND SECILIA, RESPECTIVELY. WHEREAS RAYFORCE PLAYERS MUST HEAD TOWARD EARTH TO DESTROY IT, RAYSTORM PLAYERS START AT AND MOVE AWAY FROM THE PLANET. THE PLOT OF THE GAME IS EXPOSED MINIMALLY DURING PLAY, WITH ONLY DATES AND PLACE NAMES GIVEN AT THE START OF EACH OF ITS FIRST SEVEN STAGES. AN "EXTRA MODE" INCLUDED WITH HOME VERSIONS OF THE GAME DISPLAYS MAPS BEFORE THE FIRST SEVEN STAGES AND A CLOSING CRAWL AFTER COMPLETING THE GAME, WHICH FURTHER ILLUSTRATE THE PLOT; THE MAP FOR THE FIFTH STAGE, FOR EXAMPLE, SHOWS THAT A "GRAVITY CATAPULT" AT THE MOON IS USED TO TRAVEL FROM EARTH ORBIT TO SECILIA ORBIT.

IN A FUTURE WHERE SPACE TRAVEL HAS EXISTED SINCE 2119. HUMANS EXPLORED SPACE, AND WITHIN 100 YEARS EARTH ESTABLISHED A TWENTY-COLONY STAR FEDERATION EXTENDING TO ORION, WITH EACH COLONY KEPT UNDER MARTIAL LAW. THE COLONIES THEN MUTINIED AGAINST THE FEDERATION: THEY TOOK CONTROL OF THE MAJOR COLONY SECILIA, FORMED THE SECILIA FEDERATION AND DEFEATED EARTH'S FORCES AFTER MANY BATTLES. AFTER EARTH'S SURRENDER, ALL OF ITS INHABITANTS HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE COLONIES. THE SECILIA FEDERATION SUPPRESSED COLONIAL OPPOSITION AND SENT OUT A FORCE TO DESTROY THE PLANET COMPLETELY. HOWEVER, BY THEN THE R-GRAY, A AIRCRAFT MADE WITH PARTS SALVAGED FROM 13 DIFFERENT SECILIA SHIPS, IS COMPLETED AND DEPLOYED TO CARRY OUT OPERATION RAYSTORM, A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO DEFEND EARTH FROM THE FEDERATION.</desc>

		<desc>A 36-YEAR-OLD ARCADE VIDEO GAME

REACTOR © 1982 GOTTLIEB.

THE PLAYER CONTROLS A CURSOR THAT CAN MOVE FREELY WITHIN A SCREEN-SIZED ARENA, THE NUCLEAR REACTOR. THE CENTER CONTAINS A SUN-TYPE GRAVITATIONAL POWER SOURCE, THE SLOWLY OVERHEATING REACTOR CORE. THE SURROUNDING WALL OR THE SUN, IF TOUCHED RESULTS IN DEATH. THE CURSOR IS CONTROLLED WITH A TRACKBALL BY THE PLAYER, WHO HAS TO ROLL IT FAST IN ONE DIRECTION IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THE MOMENTUM OF GRAVITATION IMPOSED BY THE SUN. SWARMS OF ENEMY OBJECTS NAMED AFTER VARIOUS RADIOACTIVE PARTICLES FLOAT AROUND IN THE REACTOR ARENA, OBEYING SIMPLE PHYSICAL LAWS. THESE ENEMIES CAN FREELY BOUNCE INTO THE WALLS AT LOW SPEEDS, HAVE A REPULSIVE FORCE AGAINST EACH OTHER AND ACTIVELY ATTACK THE PLAYER CURSOR. BOSS TYPES OFTEN BREAK UP INTO SEVERAL SMALLER PARTICLES.

THE OBJECT IS TO SURVIVE THE SUN AND WALLS WHILE GAINING THE HIGHEST SCORE POSSIBLE. IT TAKES A DELICATE TOUCH. RATHER THAN MOVING THE CURSOR/AVATAR LEFT, RIGHT, UP AND DOWN AS IN MANY ARCADE GAMES, IT IS CONTROLLED BY GRAVITY AND MOVES FREELY; WITH THE PLAYER ONLY BEING ABLE TO ACCELERATE IT RATHER THAN CONTROL ITS MOVEMENTS DIRECTLY. MEANWHILE THE ENEMY PARTICLES ARE GETTING SO AGGRESSIVE THAT IT CAN GET VERY DIFFICULT TO AVOID BEING PULLED IN BY THE SUN OR TOUCHING A WALL.

THE BASIC GAMEPLAY CONSISTS OF ACCELERATING THE CURSOR JUST AT THE RIGHT TIMES SO THAT IT CIRCLES THE REACTOR CORE WITH ENOUGH SPEED TO HAVE CONTROL VIA ITS OWN MOMENTUM WHEN THE ENEMY PARTICLES TRY TO KNOCK IT OFF COURSE, AND THEN TO PLACE DECOYS AND ACTUALLY USE THE ACCELERATION OF THE BALL ITSELF TO KNOCK ENEMIES INTO CONTROL RODS, TRAPS OR THE REACTOR CORE. BY PRESSING THE PRIMARY BUTTON THE PLAYER CURSOR CAN GO INTO HIGH POWER MODE, PROVIDING HIGHER REPULSION OF ENEMIES AND CONVERSELY HIGHER RISK TO THE PLAYER.

TO EASE THE TASK THE PLAYER ALSO HAS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DECOYS AT THEIR DISPOSAL. PRESSING THE SECONDARY BUTTON PLACES A DECOY TO ATTRACT THE ENEMIES, LURING THEM INTO TWO TRAPS IN THE CORNERS OF THE SCREEN FOR BONUS POINTS, INTO DESTROYING REACTOR RODS OR DIRECTLY INTO THE WALLS TO KILL THEM. DESTROYING A ROW OF REACTOR RODS GIVES THE PLAYER ONE MORE DECOY, AS WELL AS RESETTING THE SIZE OF THE SLOWLY SWELLING REACTOR CORE.

A TIME LIMIT IS ENFORCED BY THE SLOWLY SWELLING REACTOR CORE, WHICH LIMITS THE SPACE TO MOVE ABOUT IN THE ARENA. ALTHOUGH THE REACTOR DOESN'T ACTUALLY MELT DOWN, THE DECREASING SPACE PROVIDES FOR GRADUALLY INCREASING DIFFICULTY. AFTER DEFEATING THE FIRST WAVE OF ENEMIES, THE SOLID REACTOR CORE CHANGES INTO VORTEX CORE, UNLIKE THE PROTECT CORE, IS LETHAL TO TOUCH (THUS MAKING SUCH LEVELS SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER).</desc>

		<desc>FIRST ATTACK IN DAYLIGHT - BOMBERS IN FORMATION WITH ATTACKING AIRCRAFT. THIS SEQUENCE IS INTRODUCED BOTH AUDIBLY AND VISUALLY: RED ALERT. ENEMY AIRCRAFT APPROACHING. 20 JET FIGHTERS APPROACHING. DESTROY ALL FIGHTERS BY 11:00 HOURS, OR MIRV WILL BE LAUNCHED.
IN THIS SEQUENCE, BOMBERS IN FORMATION MOVE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT ACROSS THE SCREEN, AND THEN FROM RIGHT TO LEFT, ETC. DURING THE ATTACK, SOME BREAK FORMATION AND ATTACK THE LAUNCHER. THE AIRCRAFT DROP BOMBS IN AN ATTEMPT TO HIT THE LAUNCHER. ALSO DURING THE ATTACK, A SPECIAL RED COLORED AIRCRAFT FLYING ABOVE THE AIRCRAFT FORMATION APPEARS AND DROPS A RED COLORED MEGATON BOMB THAT SLOWLY DESCENDS ON THE COUNTRY. WHEN HOURS REACH 11:00, PRESENT FIGHTER ATTACK IS INTERRUPTED BY A FLASHING CAUTION ON SCREEN, FOLLOWED BY APPEARANCE OF THE MIRV.
THE MIRV SLOWLY DESCENDS, THEN BREAKS UP INTO SEVERAL BOMBS. THEY, IN TURN, ALSO BREAK UP INTO SEVERAL BOMBS. AS A RESULT, A SHOWER OF BOMBS SLOWLY DESCENDS ON THE COUNTRY.
PLAYER PARTICIPATION DURING THE ATTACK IS TO DESTROY ALL AIRCRAFT BY FIRING ROCKET LAUNCHER. DURING THE ATTACK, PLAYER IS TO AVOID DIRECT HITS BY BOMBS - EACH OF WHICH COSTS HIM ONE ROCKET LAUNCHER. ALSO DURING THE ATTACK, THE PLAYER MUST DESTROY THE RED BOMB BEFORE IT LANDS, OR ONE ROCKET LAUNCHER IS DESTROYED.
WHEN MIRV APPEARS, PLAYER MUST DESTROY IT COMPLETELY - OTHERWISE THE LANDING OF ANY ONE WILL COST THE PLAYER ONE LAUNCHER.</desc>

		<name>Red Baron</name>
		<desc>RED BARON IS A REALISTIC FLYING SIMULATION. YOUR PLAYER IS A WORLD WAR I FIGHTER PILOT SEARCHING THE SKIES FOR THE ENEMY. THE HORIZON SHIFTS AND TILTS AS HE MANEUVERS THE JOYSTICK. THREE DIMENSIONAL HILLS AND VALLEYS SWEEP BY BELOW.

SUDDENLY OUT OF THE HORIZON, AN ENEMY BIPLANE APPEARS. THE PILOT DIVES, CLIMBS, LINES UP THE PLANE IN HIS SIGHTS! HE FIRES A DEADLY HAIL OF TRACERS AND THE ENEMY AIRPLANE TUMBLES TO EARTH.

BUT WATCH OUT, THERE ARE MORE COMING. THE FIRST FOUR PLANES ARE RELATIVELY SLOW. AS TIME PROGRESSES, THE PLAYER MOVES MORE QUICKLY AND THE ENEMY PLANES TAKE MORE EVASIVE ACTION, ADDING TO THE DIFFICULTY AND CHALLENGE.

NEXT THE PLAYER FACES GROUND TARGETS. AN OBSERVATION BLIMP FLOATS INTO VIEW OVER A LOW RISE OF HILLS. BRIGHT GROUND OBJECTS START TO APPEAR, A TANK, A PILL-BOX, THEN DIMMER TARGETS, A PYRAMID, A BUILDING. THEY MAKE GOOD TARGETS FOR STRAFING RUNS BUT DANGER CAN APPEAR AT ANY TIME.

AS THE GAME PROGRESSES, TANKS, PILL-BOXES AND BLIMPS WILL BEGIN SHOOTING BACK. THE GAME IS COMPOSED OF RANDOMLY ALTERNATING SERIES OF GROUND AND PLANE PHASES. FINALLY, THE PLANES WILL ALSO SHOOT AT THE PLAYER.

THERE ARE OTHER DANGERS TOO. DIVE TOO LOW AND THE PLAYER CAN CRASH AND EXPLODE ON A MOUNTAIN. SQUEEZE THE TRIGGER TOO LONG AND THE GUNS OVERHEAT. AND AN ENEMY PLANE CAN GET ON THE PILOT'S TAIL, ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH UNLESS THE PLAYER IS A FLYING ACE.

WHEN A PLAYER IS HIT BY A RETURNING PLANE, BULLET HOLES AND CRACKS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN, HIS PLANE PLUMMETS TO EARTH AND EXPLODES. IF AN ENEMY SHELL FINDS ITS MARK, THE RESULT IS THE SAME BUT THE SHELL REMAINS VISIBLE.</desc>

WITH A SPACESHIP, THE PLAYER SHOOTS SEVERAL KIND OF ROBOTIC ENEMIES AND SPACESHIPS. AT THE END OF EVERY STAGE (EXCEPT FOR THE FIRST ONE), THE PLAYER MEETS A HUGE ENEMY SPACESHIP AS THE STAGE'S BOSS. PLAYER'S SPACESHIP IS EQUIPPED WITH A LIMITED FORCE SHIELD WHICH ALLOWS IT TO RESIST ANY KIND OF ATTACK, THOUGH ENERGY DRAINS BOTH WHILE IT IS ACTIVE AND WHENEVER THE SHIP GETS HIT DURING USE. POWER-UPS COME IN THE FORM OF ALLY HELICOPTERS AND CERTAIN SPACESHIPS, THAT BRING TO THE PLAYER A NEW SHOT(MUCH FASTER THAN THE NORMAL ONE) AND REFILLS THE SHIP'S FORCE FIELD METER.</desc>

THE RESCUE CHOPPER IS UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM ENEMY HELICOPTERS, WHILE SHARKS SWIM IN THE OCEAN BELOW AND WILL KILL ANY FLOATING AIRMEN THEY COME ACROSS. LATER LEVELS ALSO HAVE ENEMY SUBS AND SHIPS ALL INTENT ON FOILING THE RESCUE MISSION. PLAYERS MUST BE CAREFUL TO AVOID THE FALLING WRECKAGE OF ANY ENEMY HELICOPTERS THEY HAVE JUST DESTROYED, AND ALSO NEED TO BE WARY OF HITTING ANY PARACHUTING AIRMEN WITH THEIR 'COPTER BLADES, AS THIS WILL KILL THE AIRMEN INSTANTLY.

IN A VERY SIMILAR VEIN TO WILLIAMS' LEGENDARY "ROBOTRON", ALSO RELEASED IN '82, THE RESCUE CHOPPER IS ARMED WITH A GUN THAT CAN FIRE IN EIGHT DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE DIRECTION THE RESCUE CHOPPER IS FLYING IN. IN ADDITION TO THE EIGHT-WAY GUN, THE 'COPTER CAN ALSO DROP MISSILES FROM ITS UNDERSIDE, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR DESTROYING ENEMY SUBS AND SHIPS.

TO COMPLETE A STAGE, PLAYERS MUST PICK UP A SET NUMBER OF FALLEN AIRMEN FROM THE SEA (DETERMINED AT THE START OF EACH LEVEL) AND DEPOSIT THEM SAFELY ONTO A NEARBY ISLAND.</desc>

THE ULTIMATE AIM OF THE GAME IS TO REACH AND DESTROY THE DEATH STAR AND ESCAPE ALIVE. SUCCESS IS ACHIEVED BY SURVIVING AN 'ATTACK WAVE', WHICH CONSISTS OF FOUR DIFFERENT SCENES. PLAY SWITCHES BETWEEN ENDOR AND SPACE-BASED SCENES, WITH EACH ONE PUTTING THE PLAYER IN CONTROL OF A DIFFERENT VEHICLE FROM THE MOVIE. 

THE SCENES ARE BASED ON THREE DISTINCT LOCATIONS TAKEN FROM THE ORIGINAL MOVIE. THEY ARE: THE FOREST MOON OF ENDOR, ATTACK ON THE DEATH STAR, AND SPACE BATTLE. 

SCENE 1: SPEEDER BIKE CHASE ON ENDOR AS PRINCESS LEIA. THE GOAL IS TO REACH THE EWOK VILLAGE ALIVE. 
SCENE 2: SCOUT WALKER CHASE ON ENDOR AS CHEWBACCA. THE GOAL IS TO REACH THE SHIELD GENERATOR. 
SCENE 3: MILLENNIUM FALCON ATTACK ON DEATH STAR AS LANDO. THE GOAL IS TO REACH AND DESTROY THE DEATH STAR POWER REACTOR. 
SCENE 4: MILLENNIUM FALCON ESCAPE FROM EXPLODING DEATH STAR. THE GOAL IS TO ESCAPE THE EXPLODING DEATH STAR. 
SPLIT SCENE: PLAY SWITCHES BETWEEN SCENES 2 AND 3. 

THE SCENES LOOP FOR AS LONG AS THE PLAYER HAS LIVES REMAINING; ALTHOUGH TO INCREASE VARIETY, THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY APPEAR IS RANDOMISED AS PLAY PROGRESSES. EACH SUCCESSIVE WAVE INCREASES IN DIFFICULTY.</desc>

YOU CONTROL THE TIMING OF YOUR JUMP WITH THE JUMP BUTTON, AT WHICH POINT YOUR PARACHUTIST BEGINS HURTLING TOWARD THE GROUND OUT OF CONTROL. PRESSING THE D-RING BUTTON SHORTLY AFTERWARDS RELEASES THE CHUTE AND SLOWS YOUR DESCENT. MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT ALLOWS YOU AT THIS POINT TO CONTROL YOUR LEFT/RIGHT POSITION VIA THE PADDLE CONTROL TO HELP YOU AVOID THE ENEMIES.</desc>

THE CENTER OF THE PLAYFIELD IS OCCUPIED BY A SELECTABLE NUMBER OF TRIANGULAR FUEL CELLS THAT PULSATE WITH RADIOACTIVE ENERGY. THE PLAYER COMMANDEERS A LAND CRAFT THAT TURNS LEFT, RIGHT, ACCELERATES AND FIRES TORPEDO ENERGY BURSTS ACTIVATED BY PUSH-BUTTONS MOUNTED ON THE "BRIDGE" CONTROL PANEL. ALL IS QUIET AS THE BACKGROUND AUDIO REPEATS AN OMINOUS LOW FREQUENCY TONE. SUDDENLY, ALIEN CRAFT ENTER IN WAVES FROM THE EDGES OF THE PLAYFIELD ATTEMPTING TO ATTACH THEIR VEHICLES TO THE FUEL CELLS AND DRAG THEM OFF TO RESTOCK THEIR OWN DWINDLING SUPPLIES. THE PLAYER MANEUVERS HIS LAND SHIP INTO POSITION AND FIRES A VOLLEY OF TORPEDOES AT THE FIRST INVADER, CAUSING HIS VEHICLE TO EXPLODE IN A THUNDEROUS ROAR AND A FLASH OF LIGHT. A SECOND INVADER RETALIATES BY FIRING SHORT RANGE LASER BURSTS AT THE DEFENDER SHIP WHILE A THIRD INVADER ESCAPES, DRAGGING OFF A PRECIOUS FUEL CELL. THE BACKGROUND AUDIO QUICKENS ITS PITCH AND TEMPO AS ANOTHER WAVE OF SLEEKER, FASTER INVADERS ATTACK AND MANEUVER TO RIP OFF FUEL CANISTERS - AND THE BATTLE RAGES ON!</desc>

A VARIETY OF TRAPS AND PITFALLS AWAIT THE ROAD RUNNER - INCLUDING CANNONS, LAND MINES AND CLIFF-TOP DROPS - THAT MUST BE CAREFULLY AVOIDED OR NEGOTIATED. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, TO LURE WILE E. COYOTE INTO THESE TRAPS TO PUT SOME VALUABLE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE ROAD RUNNER AND HIS PURSUER.

PILES OF BIRDSEED ARE LITTERED THROUGHOUT THE LEVELS AND ROAD RUNNER MUST EAT THEM (BY RUNNING OVER THEM) WHENEVER POSSIBLE, AS MISSING FIVE SEED PILES WILL CAUSE ROAD RUNNER TO FEEL FAINT AND STOP RUNNING, RESULTING IN HIS BEING CAUGHT BY WILE E CAYOTE. A 'SEED METER' AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN INDICATES ROAD RUNNER'S SEED ENERY LEVEL.

ROAD RUNNER'S COLOURFUL, BEAUTIFULLY-DRAWN GRAPHICS CAPTURE THE SPIRIT AND HUMOUR OF THE LEGENDARY CARTOONS PERFECTLY. THE MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS ARE ALSO FAITHFUL TO THE CARTOON SERIES.</desc>

THE GAME'S STORY MIRRORS THAT OF THE FILM, WITH FORMER COP MURPHY, NOW A HALF-HUMAN CYBORG CALLED 'ROBOCOP', ON A QUEST TO BRING DOWN THE EVIL OCP CORPORATION.

ROBOCOP FEATURES NINE LEVELS OF ACTION, WITH TWO OF THE GAME'S NINE STAGES BEING INTO-THE-SCREEN TARGET RANGES, IN WHICH PLAYERS CAN TRY TO ACCRUE BONUS POINTS AND EARN EXTRA HEALTH. WOODEN CRATES OCCASIONALLY BAR ROBOCOP'S PROGRESS, BUT THESE CAN BE PUNCHED TO REMOVE THEM. MARKED CRATES CAN BE SMASHED TO REVEAL ONE OF THREE WEAPON POWER-UPS; THREE-WAY GUN, DUAL LASER AND THE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL COBRA GUN.

THE PLAYER MUST DESTROY THE ROBOTS AND RESCUE THE EARTH'S REMAINING HUMAN FAMILIES. THE PLAYER'S ONLY WEAPON IS A MULTI-DIRECTIONAL ANTI-ROBOT LASER GUN. USED EFFECTIVELY, IT WILL GIVE PLAYERS THE POWER TO DESTROY ALL THE ROBOT WAVES, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE INDESTRUCTIBLE 'HULK' UNIT. 

AT THE START OF THE ATTACK WAVE, PLAYERS WILL HAVE THREE CHANCES TO WIPE OUT THE ENEMY AND ADVANCE TO THE NEXT WAVE. EVERY 25,000 POINTS PLAYERS ARE GRANTED ANOTHER CHANCE TO COMPLETE THEIR MISSION. 

MAN, WOMAN, CHILD: THESE ARE THE ONLY THREE TYPES OF HUMAN CLONES LEFT ON EARTH. DEFENSELESS AND EASY PREY TO THE ROBOTS, THEY ARE TOTALLY DEPENDENT UPON PLAYERS FOR THEIR SURVIVAL AND WILL WANDER AIMLESSLY UNTIL THE PLAYER MAKES CONTACT WITH THEM. TOUCHING THEM WILL PLACE THEM UNDER THE PLAYER'S PROTECTIVE POWERS AND EARN THEM THE FOLLOWING POINTS: 1,000 FOR RESCUING THE 1ST HUMAN; 2,000 FOR THE 2ND: 3,000 FOR THE 3RD; 4,000 FOR THE 4TH; 5,000 FOR THE 5TH; AND 5,000 FOR EVERY ADDITIONAL HUMAN SAVED. AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH NEW WAVE AND WHEN THE PLAYER LOSES A TURN, RESCUE SCORING WILL AGAIN BEGIN AT 1,000.</desc>

ALL LEVELS ARE PATROLLED BY ENEMIES IN THE FORM OF DINOSAURS AND CAVEMEN AND ALL ARE DEADLY TO THE TOUCH. SOME CAVEMEN WILL PULL ON THE HARPOON ROPE WHILE THE ARCHAEOLOGIST IS CLIMBING IT. THIS WILL RESULT IN THE PLAYER FALLING FROM THE ROPE AND LOSING A LIFE. THE ARCHAEOLOGIST IS ARMED WITH A LIGHT RAY THAT WILL KILL THE ENEMIES.

A BREAKDOWN OF THE GAME'S FOUR LEVELS:

THE FIRST LEVEL IS POSSIBLY THE MOST DIFFICULT IN THE GAME. PLAYERS BEGIN AT THE BOTTOM LEFT OF THE SCREEN AND MUST WORK THEIR WAY UP TO THE ROC, WHO IS SITTING AT THE UPPER RIGHT OF THE SCREEN. THERE ARE MANY LAYERS OF LEDGES COMING OUT FROM THE SIDES OF THE SCREEN. WHILE THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN IS OPEN TO THE SKY (EXCEPT FOR A FEW FLOATING PLATFORMS). TO REACH THE TOP, PLAYERS MUST USE THE HARPOON GUN TO CLIMB DIAGONALLY BACK AND FORTH UNTIL THEY REACH THE TOP (ENSURING THAT THE PHOENIX FEATHERS HAVE BEEN COLLECTED ON THE WAY).
THE SECOND LEVEL IS SET UNDERGROUND. THERE ARE A LOT OF DINOSAURS ON THIS SCREEN AND FAR FEWER PLATFORMS THAN ON THE FIRST LEVEL. MANY OF THE PLATFORMS STRETCH COMPLETELY ACROSS THE SCREEN, SO THERE AREN'T MANY PITFALLS TO BE WARY OF. ONCE AGAIN, PLAYERS MUST GET THE ARCHAEOLOGIST TO THE TOP OF THE SCREEN TO COMPLETE THE LEVEL.
THE THIRD LEVEL IS SET OUTDOORS. A 'FERRIS WHEEL' STYLE ROTATING PLATFORM SITS IN THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN, BUT THIS CAN BE AVOIDED IF PLAYERS DON'T WISH TO USE IT. THE EASIEST ROUTE TO THE TOP IS ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE LEVEL.
THE FOURTH AND FINAL LEVEL IS SHAPED A LITTLE LIKE A MOUNTAIN. THE PLAYER'S MAIN CONCERN HERE IS A LARGE WATERFALL IN THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN. PLAYERS MUST TIME THEIR HARPOON CLIMB JUST RIGHT TO AVOID BEING KILLED BY THE DEADLY WATERS. ONCE THIS LEVEL IS FINISHED, THE GAME STARTS OVER WITH AN INCREASED LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY.</desc>

		<name>Rod-Land</name>
		<desc>ROD-LAND IS A CUTE AND COLOURFUL PLATFORM GAME FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS IN WHICH TWO FAIRY SISTERS - 'TAM' AND 'RIT' - MUST RESCUE THEIR KIDNAPPED MOTHER FROM THE 'MABOOTS TOWER' FORTRESS.

THE FAIRIES ARE ARMED WITH THE 'RODS OF SHEESANOMO' - TWO MAGICAL RODS THAT ENABLE THE FAIRIES TO CATCH ENEMIES IN A FORCE-FIELD AND SLAM THEM INTO THE PLATFORMS TO KILL THEM - AND MUST CLEAR EACH LEVEL OF ENEMIES TO MOVE ONTO THE NEXT AND EVENTUALLY REACH AND INFILTRATE THE TOWER.

AS WELL AS THE MAGICAL RODS USED FOR ATTACKING ENEMIES, THE FAIRIES CAN ALSO CREATE A MAGICAL LADDER - IN A FASHION VERY SIMILAR TO THAT USED IN TAITO'S "RAINBOW ISLANDS" - WHICH CAN BE UTILISED ANYWHERE ON A LEVEL AND ALLOWS PLAYERS TO REACH OTHER PLATFORMS OR ESCAPE FROM PURSUING ENEMIES. EACH PLAYER CAN UTILISE ONLY ONE MAGICALLY-CREATED LADDER AT ANY ONE TIME AND THE CREATION OF A NEW LADDER REMOVES THE PREVIOUSLY-CREATED ONE.

A LEVEL IS ONLY COMPLETED WHEN ALL ENEMIES HAVE BEEN KILLED. SOME DEFEATED ENEMIES DROP BONUS ITEMS, SUCH AS FRUIT, MISSILES AND BOMBS.

EACH OF THE GAME'S LEVELS FEATURES BRIGHTLY COLOURED FLOWERS. IF PLAYERS MANAGE TO COLLECT ALL OF THESE, THE 'EXTRA GAME' MODE BEGINS. DURING THIS TIME-LIMITED MODE ALL OF THE LEVEL'S ENEMIES TURN RED AND MOVE MUCH FASTER. IF THE ENEMIES ARE KILLED IN TIME, THEY DROP AN ALPHABETIC LETTER THAT CAN BE COLLECTED TO SPELL THE WORD 'EXTRA' AND EARN PLAYERS AN EXTRA LIFE.</desc>

THE PLAYER MAY ONLY CHANGE ONE WHITE BALL TO RED AT A TIME AFTER HE HAS CAPTURED A RED ROBOT, AND MUST EVADE 4 CHASER MONSTERS IN THE PROCESS. BONUS POINT MAY BE EARNED WHEN CAPTURING THE ELUSIVE 'RED KING' THAT APPEARS ON THE SCREEN. CAPTURE HIM AND MOMENTARILY IMMOBILIZE THE CHASERS, BUT DO NOT COME IN CONTACT WITH THE YELLOW ROBOTS--OR YOUR MUCH-NEEDED RED ROBOTS WILL BE CHANGED TO WHITE AND FORCE YOU TO CHANGE STRATEGY. PLAY IS OVER WHEN THE CHASERS HAVE CAPTURED ALL OF THE PLAYER'S ROBOTS. BUT, SHOULD THE PLAYER BE SUCCESSFUL IN CHANGING ALL OF THE BALLS IN THE CENTER TO RED, THE PATTERN CLEARS AND A DIFFERENT CHALLENGE IS PRESENTED. A 3X3 OR 4X4 TRI-COLORED PATTERN WILL APPEAR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TRI-COLORED CUBE OF CORRESPONDING SIZE WILL APPEAR AT THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN. THE PLAYER MAY EARN BONUS POINTS BY MOVING THE DIRECTIONAL ARROW AND REARRANGING THE COLORS OF THE CUBE AT THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN TO MATCH THE SAMPLE PATTERN PRESENTED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. THE PLAYER IS GIVEN 90 SECONDS TO REARRANGE THE CUBE AS MANY TIMES AS HE CAN. ACTION RETURNS TO THE MAZE WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE THE CUBE CHALLENGE. ALL IN ALL, AN EXCITING AND CHALLENGING GAME WHERE PATIENCE AND SKILL ARE REQUIRED.</desc>

		<desc>ROUTE 16 IS A CHALLENGING RACE CAR GAME, INTEGRATING SPECIAL FEATURES TO EXCITE THE BEGINNER AS WELL AS THE SEASONED PLAYER. THE VIVID VIDEO SCREEN IS FASCINATING, AND IS COMPLIMENTED BY EXCEPTIONAL AUDIO DURING GAME PLAY.

THE RED CAR IS CONTROLLED BY THE JOYSTICK FEATURE, AND IS PURSUED THROUGH 16 DIFFERENT ROUTES (MAZES) BY THREE CHASE CARS. THE SEARCH MODE REVEALS AN OVERVIEW OF ALL 16 ROUTES, AND THE SEARCH MODE APPEARS WHENEVER THE CAR EXITS A ROUTE. IN THE SEARCH MODE, THE PLAYER CAR BECOMES A RED CUBE, AND THE CHASE CARS BECOME YELLOW CUBES.

WHENEVER THE PLAYER CAR EXITS ONE ROUTE, THERE IS A ONE SECOND DELAY FOR A TOTAL OVERVIEW OF THE GAME.

EACH ROUTE HAS DEAD-ENDS, ZIG-ZAGS, AND MULTIPLE ENTRANCES AND EXITS.

SOME ROUTES HAVE THE DOLLAR SYMBOL ($), AND THE PLAYER SCORES 200 POINTS EACH TIME THIS SYMBOL IS CLEARED. THE DOLLAR SYMBOLS RANDOMLY CHANCE TO OIL SLICKS, AND WHEN ENCOUNTERED, THE OIL SLICKS SLOW DOWN THE PLAYER CAR.

THE QUESTION MARK SYMBOL (?) IS SURROUNDED BY CHECK POINTS AND WILL EITHER REVEAL A BOMB SYMBOL OR A BELL MARK AFTER THE PLAYER CAR CLEARS THE CHECK POINT. THE BELL WILL ADD 800 POINTS TO THE PLAYER'S SCORE WHEN CLEARED. PLAYER SKILL IS TESTED HERE TO AVOID THE BOMB IF IT APPEARS.

SOME ROUTES HAVE A FLAG SYMBOL, AND WHEN THE PLAYER CAR CLEARS THE SYMBOL, THE PURSUING CARS BECOME DOLLAR SYMBOLS, AND EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE BY THE PLAYER TO CHASE THEM DOWN, AND ADD EXTRA POINTS TO HIS SCORE.

ONE ROUTE HAS A FLICKERING BONUS CAR SYMBOL. WHEN THE SYMBOL APPEARS, CLEAR IT AND EARN AN ADDITIONAL PLAYER CAR.

ONE ROUTE HAS AN ADDITIONAL GAME FEATURE. WHEN THE PLAYER CAR ENTERS THE MAZE, IT IS PURSUED BY AN ATTACKING MONSTER. THE PLAYER CAR CANNOT CLEAR OR COLLIDE WITH THE MONSTER, BUT MUST AVOID IT, OR BE DESTROYED.

THE HIGH-SPEED BUTTON IS ANOTHER FEATURE OF ROUTE 16. WHEN PUSHED, THE PLAYER CAR IS ACCELERATED TO ESCAPE THE CHASE CARS. USAGE OF THE HIGH-SPEED BUTTON REDUCES THE PLAYER CAR'S FUEL. AT THE END OF EACH ROUND, BONUS POINTS ARE ADDED TO THE PLAYER'S SCORE FOR REMAINING FUEL.

AFTER ALL THE SYMBOLS ARE CLEARED, THE ROUND ENDS. IN SUCCESSIVE ROUNDS, ADDITIONAL DOLLAR SYMBOLS ($), AND ADDITIONAL ENEMY CHASE CARS ARE ADDED.</desc>

		<desc>THE SEQUEL TO THE HUGELY SUCCESSFUL ORIGINAL FINDS THE EVIL BYDO EMPIRE ONCE AGAIN INTENT ON THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL MANKIND IN THIS SIDEWAYS SCROLLING, SIX-LEVEL SHOOT-EM-UP.

THE INNOVATIVE WEAPONS SYSTEM OF THE ORIGINAL GAME - THE 'BEAM WEAPON' AND 'FORCE POD' - MAKE A WELCOME RETURN AND REMAIN UNCHANGED FOR THE SEQUEL.

THE TIGHT, DEMANDING GAMEPLAY AND HIGH EMPHASIS ON CORRECT USAGE OF THE WEAPONS SYSTEM ALSO RETURN - ALTHOUGH THE SEQUEL IS, IF ANYTHING, EVEN MORE DEMANDING THAN ITS ALREADY UNFORGIVING PREDECESSOR; WITH MORE DURABLE ENEMIES AND TRICKIER LEVEL DESIGN. 

R?TYPE II FEATURES THREE NEW WEAPON SHOT TYPES: 
GREEN - SEARCH LASER - FIRES SEMI-HOMING LASERS THAT CAN BEND AT 45Â° ANGLES. 
GREY - SHOTGUN LASER - FIRES LARGE SHELLS THAT TRAVEL A SHORT DISTANCE BEFORE EXPLODING POWERFULLY. 
SCATTER BOMB - DROPS BOMBS TO THE GROUND; WHEN THESE EXPLODE, THE EXPLOSION SCATTERS FORWARDS ALONG THE GROUND. THIS IS A SUPPORTING WEAPON THAT CAN BE EQUIPPED INSTEAD OF MISSILES.

IN ADDITION TO THE NEW WEAPONS, R-TYPE II'S BEAM WEAPON HAS RECEIVED AN UPGRADE. AS WITH THE FIRST GAME, HOLDING DOWN THE FIRE BUTTON MAKES A POWER GAUGE FILL UP, RELEASES THE BUTTON THEN UNLEASHES A POWERFUL PLASMA SHOT. FOR THE SEQUEL, HOWEVER, CONTINUING TO HOLD DOWN THE BUTTON CAUSES THE GAUGE TO CHARGE UP FURTHER. THIS 'DOUBLE-CHARGED' GAUGE FLASHES BLUE AND RED AND RELEASES AN EVEN MORE POWERFUL PLASMA BURST.</desc>

		<desc>R-TYPE LEO IS A HORIZONTALLY-SCROLLING SHOOT-EM-UP AND IS THE THIRD AND FINAL ARCADE RELEASE OF THIS CLASSIC SERIES (ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS CONSOLE-ONLY SEQUELS WOULD FOLLOW, SEE 'SERIES' FOR DETAILS).

MANKIND ARE CURRENTLY AT PEACE WITH THEIR FORMER ADVERSARIES, THE BYDO EMPIRE, AND HAVE TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERTAKE A MASSIVE PROJECT CALLED 'PROJECT PARADISE'. THIS INVOLVED THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN ARTIFICIAL TERRESTRIAL-LIKE PLANET CALLED 'EDEN', CREATED AS A SAFE HAVEN SHOULD HUMANITY ONCE AGAIN FIND ITSELF UNDER THREAT. HOWEVER, SOON AFTER CONSTRUCTION IS COMPLETED, 'MAJOR' - THE BIO-COMPUTER SYSTEM RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EDEN - MALFUNCTIONS, TAKING CONTROL OF THE PLANET'S DEFENCES AND LAUNCHING AN ATTACK ON MANKIND. IT IS UP TO THE NEWLY-DEVELOPED 'R-9 LEO' FLEET TO FLY IN AND STOP MAJOR'S ASSAULT ON ITS CREATORS.

R-TYPE LEO DEVIATES FROM THE GAMEPLAY STYLE OF ITS PREDECESSORS BY REMOVING THE USE OF BOTH THE 'FORCE POD' AND THE 'WAVE CANNON'. THE NEW WEAPONS ARE CALLED 'FORCE BITS' (LATER IDENTIFIED IN "R-TYPE FINAL" AS "PSY BITS") AND THE 'BIT SHOT'. THE THREE 'FORCE BIT' WEAPON TYPES ARE:
RED - CLAW LASER: A POWERFUL HORIZONTAL LASER BEAM AND HORIZONTAL TRAVERSE WAVE
BLUE - MIRROR LASER: FIRES MULTIPLE, RICOCHETING LASERS.
GREEN - SEARCH LASER LRG: FIRES SEMI-HOMING LASERS THAT CAN BEND AT 90 DEGREE ANGLES.

UNLIKE PREVIOUS 'BIT' DEVICES, THE 'FORCE/PSY BITS' ARE CAPABLE OF FIRING EITHER FORWARDS OR BACKWARDS (THEIR DIRECTION DICTATED BY THE MOVEMENT OF THE SHIP ITSELF). FINALLY, THE 'WAVE CANNON' IS REPLACED BY A 'BIT SHOT', IN WHICH THE PSY BITS DETACH FROM THE SHIP AND COLLIDE WITH THE NEAREST ENEMY. THE BITS CAN ONLY DO THIS FOR A LIMITED TIME BEFORE RUNNING OUT OF ENERGY, AND MUST BE RECALLED TO THE SHIP TO RECHARGE.

R TYPE LEO CONSISTS OF 6 STAGES AND IS THE FIRST GAME IN THE SERIES TO ALLOW 2 PLAYERS TO PLAY SIMULTANEOUSLY.</desc>

THE FIRST OF NUMEROUS INNOVATIONS THAT R?TYPE BOUGHT TO THE GENRE IS THE BEAM WEAPON: WHEN THE FIRE BUTTON IS HELD DOWN, A 'POWER METER' STARTS TO CHARGE UP; ONCE THE METER IS FULL, RELEASING THE FIRE BUTTON UNLEASHES A VERY POWERFUL PLASMA BURST CAPABLE OF INFLICTING MUCH GREATER DAMAGE TO ENEMY SHIPS OR EVEN DESTROYING NUMEROUS ENEMIES SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE TRADE-OFF IS THAT CHARGING THE WEAPON TAKES UP VALUABLE SECONDS, GIVING THE BYDO SHIPS TIME TO ATTACK.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ADDITION TO R-TYPE'S ARSENAL IS THE NOW-LEGENDARY 'FORCE POD'. THIS TAKES THE FORM OF AN INVINCIBLE, DETACHABLE LASER-FIRING POD THAT CAN BE ATTACHED TO EITHER THE FRONT OR REAR OF THE PLAYER'S SHIP, OR CAN BE DETACHED COMPLETELY, AFTER WHICH THE POD SITS SOME DISTANCE EITHER AHEAD OR BEHIND THE PLAYER'S SHIP, TRACKING ITS MOVEMENTS AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FIRE POWER. WHEN ATTACHED TO THE R9 SHIP, THE POD ACTS AS A SHIELD. THIS FORMS A CRUCIAL PART OF R?TYPE'S GAMEPLAY AND HAS TO BE FULLY UTILISED TO NAVIGATE CERTAIN SECTIONS OF THE GAME, SUCH AS THE HUGE MOTHERSHIP THAT COMPRISES THE GAME'S 3RD STAGE.

R?TYPE'S LEVELS ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE FULL USE OF ITS UNIQUE WEAPONS SYSTEM, MAKING FOR VERY LINEAR AND DEMANDING GAMEPLAY IN WHICH LOSING OR PICKING UP THE WRONG WEAPON AT THE WRONG TIME OFTEN LEADS TO AN INSTANT DEATH. ITS INTELLIGENT, PRECISE AND DEMANDING LEVEL DESIGN, GAVE THE WORLD ITS FIRST TRULY 'STRATEGIC' SHOOT-EM-UP.</desc>

		<desc>IT'S THE 21ST CENTURY IN AMERICA. TECHNOLOGY HAS IMPROVED BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS, AND NOW (MOST) PEOPLE LIVE IN PEACE. BUT IN A SMALL TOWN SOMEWHERE, A VICIOUS TERRORIST GROUP KNOWN AS ZAPPER IS TERRORIZING SMALL TOWNS AND KIDNAPPING INNOCENT PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN BUILD A SECRET WEAPON. AND, AS IT TURNS OUT, THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF SOMEONE CODE-NAMED "SUPER JOE" JUST SO HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THE INNOCENTS CAUGHT! NOW SUPER JOE'S HUNGRY FOR REVENGE. CAN SUPER JOE AND HIS ARMORED CAR DESTROY THE ZAPPER ORGANIZATION AND SAVE HIS TOWN FROM UTTER DESTRUCTION IN TIME? THE SPEED RUMBLER IS A ACTION GAME WHERE THE PLAYER RACES AGAINST THE CLOCK IN AN ARMORED CAR PILOTED BY SUPER JOE, DESTROYING OTHER CARS AND SAVING CAPTIVES ALONG THE WAY. SUPER JOE'S CAR IS ARMED WITH A GUN THAT HE CAN USE TO SHOOT DOWN ENEMY CARS, BUT THE ENEMY CARS HAVE A FEW TRICKS UP THEIR SLEEVE, SO SUPER JOE SHOULD ALWAYS BE ON GUARD. AS THE PLAYER PROGRESSES THROUGH THE GAME'S SIX STAGES, SUPER JOE CAN BE GIVEN A BOOST BY SAVING CAPTIVES, WHO THEN AWARD HIM WITH BONUS POINTS, INCREASED FIRE POWER, OR SPEED-UPS. IF SUPER JOE'S CAR IS DESTROYED, HE CAN CONTINUE THE FIGHT ON FOOT WITH HIS RIFLE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, SUPER JOE IS NOT AS POWERFUL AS HIS CAR - ONE HIT AND HE'S HISTORY. SUPER JOE HAS 24 "HOURS" TO DESTROY ZAPPER. THE GAME IS OVER WHEN SUPER JOE RUNS OUT OF LIVES OR TIME - OR IF HE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES HIS MISSION.</desc>

BUT THE CHARACTERS AND ANIMALS WERE LARGE, AND VERY DETAILED FOR JUST USING A SINGLE COLOR. THERE WERE 4 DIFFERENT ANIMALS THAT YOU COULD HUNT. SNAKES AND LIONS WERE BOTH RATHER SLOW MOVING, AND GOOD FOR 100 POINTS EACH. WILD BOARS WOULD RUN QUICKLY ACROSS THE SCREEN, BUT WOULD NET YOU 200 FOR A KILL. FINALLY, VULTURES WERE SMALL AND WOULD MOVE AROUND ERRATICALLY NEAR THE TOP OF THE SCREEN (BEING WORTH 300 POINTS IF YOU COULD HIT THEM). TOUCHING ANY OF THE BEASTIES MEANT INSTANT DEATH, BUT IT MATTERED LITTLE, BECAUSE THIS GAME PLAYED ON TIME LIMITS ANYWAY. DEATH ONLY MEANT THAT YOU WOULD LOSE A FEW SECONDS WAITING FOR YOUR INTREPID BIG GAME HUNTER TO REAPPEAR (THE GAME LASTED 90 SECONDS TOTAL).</desc>

		<desc>SALAMANDER IS A 1 OR 2 PLAYER SEQUEL TO 1985'S SUPERB SHOOT-EM-UP, "NEMESIS". WHILE IT RETAINED THE SAME BASIC GAMEPLAY AND FEEL OF ITS PREDECESSOR (PARTICULARLY THE SUPERB AND INNOVATIVE WEAPONS SYSTEM), SALAMANDER FEATURED BOTH SUPERIOR GRAPHICS AND A MORE IMAGINATIVE APPROACH TO LEVEL DESIGN. THE EARLIEST EXAMPLE OF THE LATTER APPEARS TOWARDS THE END OF THE VERY FIRST LEVEL, IN WHICH IMPOSING, ORGANIC OBSTRUCTIONS GROW BEFORE THE PLAYERS' EYES. THE GAME'S THIRD LEVEL - THE INFAMOUS 'LAVA' LEVEL - IS ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE OF SALAMANDER'S SUPERB DESIGN; WITH HUGE SOLAR FLARES CONSTANTLY ERUPTING BOTH ABOVE AND BELOW THE PLAYER'S SHIP THAT MUST BE CAREFULLY NAVIGATED TO AVOID INSTANT LOSS OF LIFE. SALAMANDER INTRODUCED FURTHER VARIETY TO THE ACTION WITH THE INTRODUCTION VERTICALLY-SCROLLING LEVELS, WHICH ALTERNATED WITH THE STANDARD SIDE-SCROLLING LEVELS.

SALAMANDER'S WEAPON POWER-UP SYSTEM IS AS FOLLOWS:
SPEED UP: FIVE SPEED LEVELS.
MISSILE: PRESS MISSILE BUTTON TO LAUNCH.
LASER: YOUR FORWARD ROCKETS TURN INTO DEADLY LASERS.
RIPPLE LASER: USE SHOOT BUTTON TO FIRE.
FORCE FIELD: PROTECT YOUR SHIP WITH BARRIERS.
MULTIPLE: INCREASE YOUR FIRE POWER BY UP TO FOUR TIMES.

MULTIPLE SPECIAL POWERS CAN BE OBTAINED, BUT THE LASER CANNOT BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RIPPLE LASER.</desc>

		<name>Salamander</name>
		<desc>SALAMANDER IS A 1 OR 2 PLAYER SEQUEL TO 1985'S SUPERB SHOOT-EM-UP, "NEMESIS". WHILE IT RETAINED THE SAME BASIC GAMEPLAY AND FEEL OF ITS PREDECESSOR (PARTICULARLY THE SUPERB AND INNOVATIVE WEAPONS SYSTEM), SALAMANDER FEATURED BOTH SUPERIOR GRAPHICS AND A MORE IMAGINATIVE APPROACH TO LEVEL DESIGN. THE EARLIEST EXAMPLE OF THE LATTER APPEARS TOWARDS THE END OF THE VERY FIRST LEVEL, IN WHICH IMPOSING, ORGANIC OBSTRUCTIONS GROW BEFORE THE PLAYERS' EYES. THE GAME'S THIRD LEVEL - THE INFAMOUS 'LAVA' LEVEL - IS ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE OF SALAMANDER'S SUPERB DESIGN; WITH HUGE SOLAR FLARES CONSTANTLY ERUPTING BOTH ABOVE AND BELOW THE PLAYER'S SHIP THAT MUST BE CAREFULLY NAVIGATED TO AVOID INSTANT LOSS OF LIFE. SALAMANDER INTRODUCED FURTHER VARIETY TO THE ACTION WITH THE INTRODUCTION VERTICALLY-SCROLLING LEVELS, WHICH ALTERNATED WITH THE STANDARD SIDE-SCROLLING LEVELS.

SALAMANDER'S WEAPON POWER-UP SYSTEM IS AS FOLLOWS:
SPEED UP: FIVE SPEED LEVELS.
MISSILE: PRESS MISSILE BUTTON TO LAUNCH.
LASER: YOUR FORWARD ROCKETS TURN INTO DEADLY LASERS.
RIPPLE LASER: USE SHOOT BUTTON TO FIRE.
FORCE FIELD: PROTECT YOUR SHIP WITH BARRIERS.
MULTIPLE: INCREASE YOUR FIRE POWER BY UP TO FOUR TIMES.

MULTIPLE SPECIAL POWERS CAN BE OBTAINED, BUT THE LASER CANNOT BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RIPPLE LASER.</desc>

		<name>Satan's Hollow</name>
		<desc>SATAN'S HOLLOW IS A 1- OR A 2-PLAYER GAME. WHEN PLAYING THIS GAME, THE ROCKET LAUNCHER IS UNDER YOUR CONTROL. YOU MAKE IT MOVE BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE SCREEN TO LAUNCH ROCKETS THAT WILL ELIMINATE YOUR ATTACKERS. THESE ATTACKERS ARE DISPLAYED IN GROUPS, CALLED 'RACKS', ACROSS THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. THE FIRST RACK IS MADE UP OF A SMALL NUMBER OF ATTACKERS. THE SECOND RACK IS MADE UP OF A LARGER NUMBER OF THESE ATTACKERS. AND INTERMIXED WITH THE RACKS OF ATTACKERS IS A RACK WITH ONLY A SINGLE FIRE-BREATHING DEVIL'S HEAD. 

THE ATTACKERS AND THE DEVIL'S HEAD WILL TRY TO WIPE OUT YOUR ROCKET LAUNCHER. IF THEY DO, YOU LOSE ONE PLAYER. IN EMERGENCIES, YOU HAVE A SHIELD WHICH GOES ALL AROUND YOUR ROCKET LAUNCHER FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. IT IS ACTIVATED BY PUSHING THE SHIELD BUTTON ON THE CONTROL CONSOLE. BUT BE CAREFUL!! THIS CONSUMES A LOT OF POWER AND WILL ONLY LAST A VERY SHORT TIME! 

EACH ATTACKER ELIMINATED WILL CAUSE A BRIDGE SECTION TO APPEAR AT THE LOWER LEFT CORNER OF THE SCREEN EXCEPT: WHEN THERE IS ALREADY A BRIDGE SECTION THERE OR WHEN YOU HAVE A BRIDGE SECTION IN TOW UNDER YOUR ROCKET LAUNCHER. PICK THESE SECTIONS UP WITH YOUR ROCKET LAUNCHER AND MOVE THEM OVER TO BUILD A BRIDGE ACROSS THE GORGE AT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN LEADING INTO THE LAND OF SATAN. 

WHEN YOU COMPLETE YOUR BRIDGE INTO THE LAND OF SATAN, YOU CAN CROSS IT AND DO BATTLE WITH HIM. IF YOU WIN YOU WILL BE REWARDED BY INCREASED FIRE POWER FOR YOUR ROCKET LAUNCHER. IF SATAN DEFEATS YOU, YOU LOSE ONE PLAYER. 

AS YOUR SKILL LEVEL INCREASES, THE NUMBER OF ATTACKERS IS INCREASED AND THE SPEED THAT THE FIRE-BREATHING DEVIL'S HEAD MOVES IS INCREASED ALSO. 

BONUS ROCKET LAUNCHERS ARE AWARDED TO YOU PERIODICALLY THROUGHOUT THE GAME AS YOU REACH OR PASS CERTAIN PRESELECTED POINT VALUES. EACH ATTACKER HAS AN ASSIGNED POINT VALUE. 

THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO HAVE FUN WHILE CONSTANTLY IMPROVING YOUR SKILLS AS YOU PLAY, ELIMINATING AS MANY ATTACKERS AS POSSIBLE EACH TIME TO GET THE HIGHEST SCORE.</desc>

		<desc>SCRAMBLE IS A SIDEWAYS SCROLLING SHOOT-EM-UP IN WHICH A SINGLE PLAYER TAKES CONTROL OF A SPACESHIP AND MUST TRY TO FIGHT THROUGH SIX DIFFERENT ENEMY-PACKED LEVELS - DESTROYING AS MANY FUEL TANKS AND GROUND INTALLATIONS AS POSSIBLE - BEFORE REACHING THE ENEMY BASE AND DESTROYING IT. 

CONTACT WITH ANY SCENERY, GROUND INSTALLATIONS, ENEMY SHIPS OR PROJECTYLES RESULTS IN AN INSTANT LOSS OF LIFE. THE SCRAMBLE SHIP IS ARMED WITH BOTH A BLASTER AND BOMBS. THE BLASTER IS FORWARD-FIRING ONLY WHILE THE BOMBS DROP DOWNWARDS TO TARGET GROUND-BASED ENEMY INSTALLATIONS AND TO COLLECT FUEL FROM FUEL DUMPS. 

THE FUEL DUMPS ARE OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE, AS THE PLAYER SHIP'S FUEL GAUGE CONSTANTLY DEPLETES AS THE PLAYER PROGRESSES THROUGH THE GAME AND THE ONLY WAY TO RE-FUEL IS BY BOMBING THE FUEL TANKS THAT ARE LOCATED ON THE GROUND THROUGHOUT THE LEVELS. FUEL USAGE INCREASES AS THE GAME PROGRESSES, UNTIL FUEL USAGE ACTUALLY OUTSTRIPS THE AMOUNT OF FUEL DUMPS AVAILABLE AND THE GAME BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE. 

SCRAMBLE IS RIGHTLY CONSIDERED TO BE A CLASSIC AND WAS THE WORLD'S FIRST EVER 'MULTI-LEVEL' SHOOT-EM-UP.</desc>

		<desc>AS A SOLE ASTRONAUT, YOU MUST PENETRATE THE ALIEN BALANGOOL SPACE CRAFT AND DESTROY THE EVIL 'L-BRAIN'. MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH 27 ALPHABET-LABELED LEVELS TO FIND HIS LAIR.

THE PLAYER MANEUVERS THE SPACE RANGER THROUGHOUT THE ENEMY SPACE STATION, WHICH CONSISTS OF 26 ALPHABETICALLY ORDERED CORRIDORS KNOWN AS "SECTIONS", STARTING FROM SECTION A AND ENDING AT THE TITULAR SECTION Z. THE GAME IS DIVIDED INTO FIVE STAGES, EACH CONSISTING OF FIVE SECTIONS (WITH THE FINAL STAGE HAVING SIX SECTIONS TO ACCOMMODATE THE SPARE LETTER). THE PLAYER WILL FIGHT AN ENEMY BOSS AT THE END OF EACH STAGE, CONCLUDING WITH THE FINAL BATTLE AGAINST THE "L BRAIN" AT SECTION Z. THE GAME'S STAGES ALTERNATES BETWEEN HORIZONTAL-SCROLLING STAGE (LEFT OR RIGHT) AND UPWARDS VERTICAL-SCROLLING STAGES. THE PLAYER WILL LOSE A LIFE EVERY TIME THEY GET HIT BY ENEMY FIRE. ADDITIONAL LIVES CAN BE OBTAINED IF THE PLAYER ACHIEVES A HIGH ENOUGH SCORE. THE GAME WILL BE OVER IF THE PLAYER LOSES ALL OF THEIR LIVES, ALTHOUGH A CHANCE TO CONTINUE WILL BE PROVIDED.

THE CONTROLS CONSISTS OF AN EIGHT-WAY JOYSTICK AND TWO BUTTONS, ONE FOR SHOOTING AND THE OTHER FOR CHANGING THE CHARACTER'S AIM TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT. THIS ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO SHOOT AT ONE DIRECTION WHILE MOVING AWAY TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE. THE PLAYER WILL SHOOT THEIR RIFLE TOWARDS THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT WITH THE FIRE BUTTON, WHILE DROPPING BOMBS AT THE SAME TIME TO THE GROUND. BY DESTROYING CERTAIN DOME-SHAPED CONTAINERS, THE PLAYER CAN OBTAIN ONE OF THREE POWER-UP ITEMS REPRESENTED BY LETTERS: S, P, AND B. S INCREASES THE PLAYER'S MOBILITY SPEED, WHILE P INCREASES THEIR FIRING POWER; EACH CAN IMPROVED FOR UP TO THREE INCREMENTS. HOWEVER, THESE POWER-UPS WILL BE LOST WHENEVER THE PLAYER LOSES A LIFE. THE B ITEM WILL SIMPLY GIVE THE PLAYER BONUS POINTS</desc>

		<desc>GUARDIAN STORM (KNOWN IN KOREA AS JEON SIN, AND MISTAKENLY IN MAME AS SEN JIN) IS A VERTICAL SHOOT 'EM UP DEVELOPED BY AFEGA AND PUBLISHED BY APPLE INDUSTRIES. RELEASED IN MAY 1998, IT HAS EIGHT STAGES. PLAYERS COLLECT GOLD THAT THEY CAN TRADE IN FOR POWER-UPS, BOMBS, AND EXTRA LIVES BETWEEN STAGES.
GUARDIAN STORM RUNS ON THE SAME SHOOTING ENGINE AS RED HAWK, SO IT CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A KIND OF SEQUEL. THE DESIGN, HOWEVER, IS MUCH MORE CARTOONY, EVEN THOUGH THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE WESTERN RELEASE DOESN'T SHOW IT AT ALL. ONE OF THE CHARACTERS IS SUN WUKONG ON A CLOUD, AND THERE'S SOME CRAZY ENEMIES LIKE THE DOL HAREUBANG STATUES OF JEJU ISLAND. POWERUP PICKUPS DURING THE STAGES HAVE BECOME MUCH RARER NOW, MORE ENEMIES NOW DROP MONEY INSTEAD, WHICH CAN BE USED TO BUY UPGRADES IN A STORE AFTER EACH STAGE, BUT USUALLY SPENDING POWER IS VERY LIMITED, WHICH IS THE MAJOR REASON FOR THIS GAME BEING MUCH HARDER THAN RED HAWK. GUARDIAN STORM WAS ALSO QUITE SUCCESSFUL INTERNATIONALLY.</desc>

SHADOW FORCE HAS 6 BUTTONS: 2 FOR PUNCHES (LOW AND HIGH) 2 FOR KICKS (LOW AND HIGH) 1 FOR JUMPING AND 1 FOR POSSESSING AN ENEMY. ADDITIONAL ATTACK MOVES CAN BE UTILISED BY MOVING THE JOYSTICK UP OR DOWN AND PRESSING PUNCH AND KICK BUTTONS. IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO COMBINE PUNCH AND KICK ATTACKS TO OBTAIN DIFFERENT COMBOS AND WHILE THE ENEMIES CAN DO THE SAME, THE NUMBER AND VARIATION OF THEIR ATTACKS IS GENERALLY LOWER THAN THOSE AVAILABLE TO THE PLAYERS.

IN ADDITION TO BEING ABLE TO POSSESS NEARBY ENEMIES, SHADOW FORCE ALSO FEATURES SOMETHING ELSE NEW TO THE SIDE-SCROLLING BEAT-EM-UP GENRE; AT THE END OF EACH STAGE PLAYERS TAKE PART IN A BONUS ROUND CONSISTING OF A ONE-ON-ONE FIGHT. 

PLAYERS CAN CHOOSE TO START ON ANY ONE OF THE FIRST THREE STAGES AND THE GAME FEATURES 14 DIFFERENT POSSIBLE ENDINGS.</desc>

IT IS CONTROLLED WITH AN 8-WAY JOYSTICK AND 4 BUTTONS THAT PERFORM WEAK AND STRONG VERSIONS OF PUNCHES AND KICKS. IN ONE PLAYER MODE, AFTER SELECTING A CHARACTER, THE ARCADE RANDOMLY SELECTS AN OPPONENT. THE OPPONENT ORDER GOES RANDOMLY AND ALWAYS LEAVES THE LAST FOUR BOSSES IN A CERTAIN ORDER. SOME CHARACTERS STABBED BY ONES ARMED WITH KATANAS OR OTHER SHARP WEAPONS CAN CAUSE BLOOD TO SPURT OUT, WHICH BECAME POPULARIZED A FEW MONTHS LATER BY MIDWAY'S MORTAL KOMBAT. THE MAIN UNIQUE FEATURE OF SHOGUN WARRIORS IS ITS "GRABBING SYSTEM". WHEN THE PLAYER IS GRABBED BY THE OPPONENT, THE GRABBER MUST MOVE THE JOYSTICK LEFT AND RIGHT TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR HIS OPPONENT TO ESCAPE, WHILE THE ONE BEING GRABBED MUST RAPIDLY PRESS ANY OR ALL BUTTONS TO MAKE IT EASIER TO ESCAPE.</desc>

		<desc>SKULL &amp; CROSSBONES IS A SWASHBUCKLING ADVENTURE IN WHICH PLAYERS PORTRAY TWO PIRATES COMPETING FOR FOOD, DRINK, BOOTY, AND REVENGE. PLAYERS USE A JOYSTICK AND BUTTON TO CONTROL THE UNIQUE SWORD-FIGHTING ACTION.

THE GAME BEGINS WITH AN ENCOUNTER WITH THE EVIL WIZARD, WHO ROBS OUR HEROES OF ALL OF THEIR BOOTY. THE PIRATES SWEAR REVENGE AND SET OFF ON A QUEST TO DESTROY THE WIZARD AND RECOVER THEIR TREASURE.

THE ADVENTURE TAKES THEM AROUND THE WORLD. THE PIRATES BATTLE THE FIERCE CAPTAINS AND CREWS OF OPPONENT SHIPS. THEY ENCOUNTER THE SOLDIER GUARDS AND THE MERCILESS EXECUTIONER IN THE SPANISH CASTLE. IN THE NINJA CAMP THEY FIGHT THE NINJA MASTER AND HIS FOLLOWERS. ON THE BEACH THE HEROES ENCOUNTER THE DREADED MEDUSA AND A HORDE OF WICKED SKELETONS THAT RISE FROM THE DEAD.

FINALLY, THE PIRATES REACH THE WIZARD'S ISLAND, WHERE THEY MUST AGAIN DO BATTLE AGAINST THE SHADOW FIGURES OF THE EXECUTIONER, THE NINJA MASTER, AND THE MEDUSA BEFORE THEY CAN FIGHT FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE EVIL WIZARD. IF THEY MAKE IT TO THE THRONE ROOM AND OVERCOME THE WIZARD, PLAYERS ARE REWARDED WITH A ROOM FULL OF TREASURE.

PLAYERS USE A JOYSTICK AND SWORD BUTTON IN A COMBINATION OF DEFENSIVE AND OFFENSIVE MANEUVERS TO BATTLE THE VARIOUS ENEMIES. PLAYERS CAN LEARN THE LUNGE AND BACK-SLASH, TWO. SKILLED SWORD-FIGHTING MOVES THAT ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE.

IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE LONG-TERM APPEAL OF THE GAME, PLAYERS CAN SELECT VARIOUS DIFFICULTY LEVELS OF EASY, MEDIUM, AND HARD TO VARY THEIR PATHS THROUGH THE GAME. BY SELECTING THE LONGER HARD PATH, PLAYERS ARE REWARDED WITH MORE FOOD, DRINK, AND BOOTY ALONG THE WAY.</desc>

SECOND, THERE ARE BOTH GROUND AND AIR UNITS THAT ATTEMPT TO KEEP SKY KID FROM ACCOMPLISHING HIS MISSION. LAST, SKY KID MAY HAVE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH SOME VERY INHOSPITABLE TERRAIN OR NAVIGATE AROUND CITIES IN ORDER TO GET TO THE TARGET. THE TARGETS THAT SKY KID MUST BOMB WILL EITHER BE A FORTRESS COMPLEX OR A SHIP. AS ONE MOVES FARTHER UP IN THE MISSIONS, IT ISN'T UNCOMMON TO HAVE MULTIPLE TARGETS IN ONE MISSION. PERHAPS BARNSTORMING WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER IDEA.</desc>

THE PLAYER STARTS THE GAME ARMED ONLY WITH A PISTOL, AND THIS HAS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION. ONCE THE AMMO HAS RUN OUT, PLAYERS CAN ONLY KICK THEIR ENEMIES. MACHINE GUNS ARE OCCASIONALLY DROPPED BY DEFEATED ENEMIES AND CAN BE PICKED UP AND USED. ALSO, GOLDEN GUN COMPONENTS ARE SOMETIMES DROPPED; THERE ARE SIX OF THESE IN TOTAL AND ONCE ALL HAVE BEEN COLLECTED, THE PLAYER IS REWARDED WITH A VERY POWERFUL GOLDEN RIFLE. THIS WEAPON KILLS ALL ENEMIES INSTANTLY BUT WILL ONLY LAST FOR TWENTY-FIVE SECONDS, INDICATED BY A METER AT THE TOP-RIGHT OF THE SCREEN.

MOST OF THE GAME'S EIGHT STAGES ARE PLATFORM-BASED, BUT THERE ARE ALSO TWO UNDERWATER SCUBA LEVELS AND A MOTORBIKE CHASE. ALL OF THE GAME'S END-OF-LEVEL BOSSES REAPPEAR ON THE FINAL 'UNDERGROUND LAIR' LEVEL.

WHILE NOT OFFICIALLY LICENSED AS A JAMES BOND GAME, SECRET AGENT IS UNMISTAKABLY MEANT TO REPRESENT BOTH THE BOND CHARACTER AND MOVIE SERIES. THE BOND VILLAIN JAWS SHOWS UP AT THE END OF STAGE TWO AND ANOTHER FAMOUS BOND VILLAIN, ODD JOB ALSO APPEARS. ANOTHER MEMORABLE BOND REFERENCE IS THE USE OF A SHAUN CONNERY IMPERSONATOR WHO TELLS PLAYERS THAT THEY HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB UPON COMPLETION OF A LEVEL.</desc>

THE GAME IS A SEQUEL TO THE LEGENDARY "ROBOTRON: 2084" AND LIKE ITS PREQUEL, UTILISES A DUAL JOYSTICK CONTROL SYSTEM, WITH THE LEFT STICK CONTROLLING PLAYER MOVEMENT AND THE RIGHT CONTROLLING THE DIRECTION OF FIRE. 

ENEMY WAVES ENTER EACH ARENA FROM FOUR DIRECTIONS VIA OPEN DOORWAYS AND ALL MUST BE KILLED BEFORE PLAYERS CAN PROGRESS TO THE NEXT STAGE. SOME ARENAS FEATURE STATIC GUN EMPLACEMENTS SET INTO A WALL THAT MUST ALSO BE DESTROYED. POWER-UPS THAT IMPROVE WEAPONS, SPEED AND ARMOUR APPEAR AT REGULAR INTERVALS, ALTHOUGH EACH ONLY LASTS FOR A LIMITED TIME.

SMASH TV IS BROKEN DOWN INTO STAGES, EACH WITH A SET NUMBER OF ARENAS. TOUGH END-OF-LEVEL BOSSES AWAIT AT THE END OF EACH STAGE. AS WELL AS THE PRIZES AND POWER-UPS, KEYS CAN BE COLLECTED AND IF ENOUGH HAVE BEEN PICKED UP BY THE END OF THE GAME, PLAYERS CAN ACCESS A BONUS LEVEL CALLED THE PLEASURE DOME.</desc>

		<name>Snow Bros. - Nick &amp; Tom</name>
		<desc>ONE OR TWO PLAYERS TAKE ON THE ROLES OF SNOWMEN NICK AND TOM AS THEY BATTLE A VARIETY OF MONSTERS OVER FIFTY PLATFORM-BASED, SINGLE SCREEN LEVELS. 

THE SNOWMEN CAN THROW SNOWBALLS AT THE ENEMIES WITH THE AIM OF ENCASING THEM COMPLETELY IN SNOW. THE ENCASED ENEMIES CAN THEN BE KICKED IN ORDER TO DESTROY THEM AND THIS IS ACHIEVED BY STANDING NEXT TO THE SNOWBALL AND PRESSING THE "KICK OUT" BUTTON. THIS SENDS THE GIANT SNOWBALL FLYING AROUND THE SCREEN, KILLING ANY ENEMIES THAT LAY IN ITS PATH. 

IF PLAYERS TAKE TOO MUCH TIME TO COMPLETE A STAGE, AN EVIL PUMPKIN HEAD WILL APPEAR AND TRY TO KILL THEM. THE PUMPKIN IS INVINCIBLE BUT CAN BE STUNNED WITH SNOWBALLS. AFTER A SHORT TIME THE EVIL PUMPKIN WILL SPAWN GHOSTS THAT CAN TRAVEL FREELY AROUND THE STAGE AS THEY SEEK OUT NICK AND TOM. THESE GHOSTS CAN'T BE KILLED OR STUNNED, SO THE PLAYER'S ONLY HOPE IS TO AVOID THEM WHILE ELIMINATING THE REMAINING STANDARD ENEMIES, TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SCREEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

WHEN PLAYERS DEFEAT AN ENEMY, IT MAY DROP A COLOURED POTION BOTTLE. THESE CAN BE PICKED UP AND ACT AS POWER-UPS:
YELLOW = LONG SHOT
RED = SPEED UP
BLUE = BIGGER SNOWBALLS (ENCASES MONSTERS QUICKER)
GREEN = INFLATES THE PLAYERS LIKE A BALLOON AND LETS THEM FLY AROUND THE SCREEN, KILLING ANY MONSTERS THEY TOUCH.

EVERY 10TH LEVEL FEATURES A BATTLE WITH A LARGE END-OF-LEVEL BOSS.</desc>

		<desc>SOLAR FOX IS A SPACE SHOOTER AND A PAC-MAN TYPE GAME ALL IN ONE. THE PLAYING FIELD IS SQUARE AND ONLY HAS WALLS ON THE OUTSIDE. EACH WALL HAS A MOVING CANNON MOUNTED THAT WILL FIRE ODD SHAPED TORPEDOES AT YOUR SHIP. SCATTERED AROUND THE INSIDE WILL BE A BUNCH OF PELLETS IN VARIOUS SIMPLE PATTERNS. TO COMPLETE EACH LEVEL YOU HAVE TO DRIVE OVER, OR SHOOT ALL OF THE PELLETS. IF DONE QUICKLY ENOUGH THE GAME WILL SKIP A LEVEL (GOING FROM 1 TO 3, ETC), AND AWARD YOU POINT FOR THE LEVEL SKIPPED.

IF YOU SELECT NOVICE DIFFICULTY AT THE BEGINNING, THE SOLAR FOX'S NORMAL SPEED WILL BE SLOW, AND PRESSING THE SPEED BUTTON WILL SPEED IT UP. IF YOU SHOULD SELECT EXPERT DIFFICULTY, ITS NORMAL SPEED WILL BE FASTER, AND PRESSING THE SPEED BUTTON WILL SLOW IT DOWN. EVERY FOURTH RACK IS ALSO A BONUS RACK, AND IF YOU DIE IN ONE, IT WILL NOT COST YOU A LIFE. AFTER CLEARING TEN RACKS, A PLAYER BECOMES A MEMBER OF THE "10-RACK CLUB" AND THE GAME WILL CONTINUE ON AS NORMAL.</desc>

A PLAYER CONTROLLED SPACE SHIP IS RANDOMLY LOCATED ON THE SCREEN. THE SPACE SHIP'S MOVEMENT IS CONTROLLED BY ROTATE RIGHT, ROTATE LEFT, AND THRUST BUTTONS. FOR QUICK ESCAPES, THE SPACE SHIP CAN BE THRUST INTO HYPERSPACE, CAUSING THE SHIP TO DISAPPEAR AND THEN REAPPEAR IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION.

THE SPACE SHIP POSSESSES TWO WEAPONS. THE FIRST WEAPON CONSISTS OF SHOTS FIRED BY PRESSING THE FIRE BUTTON. THESE SHOTS WILL DESTROY ANY ALIEN SHIPS THEY STRIKE, BUT WILL DISINTEGRATE IF THEY DO NOT HIT ANY TARGETS. THE SECOND WEAPON IS A NUKE WHICH IS LAUNCHED BY PRESSING THE NUKE BUTTON. THE NUKE WILL CONTINUE TO TRAVEL ACROSS THE SCREEN UNTIL EITHER IT STRIKES A TARGET OR THE PLAYER DETONATES THE NUKE BY PRESSING THE NUKE BUTTON A SECOND TIME. THE NUKE WILL DESTROY ALL ALIEN SHIPS WITHIN A LIMITED RADIUS OF THE EXPLOSION.</desc>

		<desc>SOLOMON'S KEY IS A SINGLE PLAYER PLATFORM/PUZZLE GAME IN WHICH THE WIZARD DANA IS ON A QUEST TO RETRIEVE SOLOMON'S KEY AND VANQUISH THE DEMON HORDES THAT HAVE BROKEN THROUGH INTO HIS WORLD. TO ACHIEVE THIS DANA MUST ADVANCE THROUGH THE FIFTY ROOMS OF 'CONSTELLATION SPACE', BEFORE FINALLY REACHING THE MAGICAL KEY.

DANA IS ARMED WITH A MAGIC WAND THAT CAN BE USED TO BOTH DESTROY AND CREATE GRANITE BLOCKS, WHILE BLOCKS SITUATED DIRECTLY ABOVE DANA'S HEAD CAN BE DESTROYED BY REPEATEDLY JUMPING UP INTO THEM UNTIL THEY SHATTER. THE BLOCKS ACT AS PLATFORMS, AS WELL AS BARRIERS TO DEFEND DANA FROM THE NUMEROUS PATROLLING ENEMIES. EACH ROOM CONTAINS A GOLDEN KEY, RETRIEVING THIS AUTOMATICALLY OPENS THE ROOM'S EXIT DOOR AND PLAYERS MUST THEN TRY TO FIND/CREATE A SAFE ROUTE PAST THE CONSTANTLY SPAWNING DEMONS TO REACH THE EXIT AND PROGRESS TO THE NEXT ROOM. 

BONUS ITEMS - SOME HIDDEN INSIDE PRE-EXISTING GRANITE BLOCKS - ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT EACH ROOM. COLLECTING THESE EARNS THE PLAYER EXTRA POINTS. POWER-UPS CAN ALSO BE FOUND, THESE APPEAR AS POTION BOTTLES WITH A FLAME EMBLAZONED ON THEM AND A MAXIMUM OF THREE CAN BE CARRIED AT ANY ONE TIME. WHEN A POTION IS USED, DANA SHOOTS A FIREBALL WHICH WILL MOVE ALONG THE WALLS AND PLATFORMS UNTIL IT HITS AND KILLS THE FIRST DEMON IT COMES INTO CONTACT WITH.

AS WELL AS BONUS ITEMS AND POWER-UPS, EACH ROOM ALSO CONTAINS A HAND-BELL. WHEN COLLECTED THIS TRIGGERS THE RELEASE OF A TRAPPED FAIRY, THE FAIRY WILL THEN SLOWLY FLY AROUND THE ROOM AND CAN BE RESCUED FOR BONUS POINTS. AN EXTRA LIFE IS AWARDED FOR EVERY TEN FAIRIES RESCUED.

THE GAME'S LEVELS ARE BASED ON ZODIAC STAR CONSTELLATIONS. THE MAIN LEVELS ARE DIVIDED INTO GROUPS OF FOUR - MAKING A TOTAL OF FOURTY-EIGHT STANDARD ROOMS - WITH EACH GROUP REPRESENTING A SEPARATE CONSTELLATION. IN ADDITION TO THE STANDARD ROOMS, EACH CONSTELLATION ALSO HAS A SECRET BONUS ROOM THAT CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED BY FINDING THE GIVEN CONSTELLATION'S 'SEAL', WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE LAST ROOM OF EACH GROUP. THERE ARE THREE FURTHER SECRET ROOMS - 'PAGE OF TIME', 'THE PAGE OF SPACE' AND THE 'PRINCESS ROOM' - THAT ARE ONLY ACCESSIBLE IF THE PLAYER HAS FOUND THE 'HIDDEN SEALS OF SOLOMON'.

THE FOUR ROOM GROUPS ARE:
1-4 ARIES 5-8 TAURUS 9-12 GEMINI
13-16 CANCER 17-20 LEO 21-24 SCORPIO
25-28 LIBRA 29-32 VIRGO 33-36 SAGITTARIUS

		<desc>SON SON IS A 2-D SIDESCROLLING PLATFORMER. THE SCREEN SCROLLS AUTOMATICALLY, ONLY STOPPING TO FIGHT MAJOR ENEMIES. THE SCREEN FEATURES SIX CONTINUOUS PLATFORMS THAT OCCASIONALLY FEATURE SMALL GAPS. SONSON AND TONTON WALK AUTOMATICALLY ACROSS THESE PLATFORMS. PRESSING UP OR DOWN WILL CAUSE THEM TO JUMP UP OR DOWN TO THE NEXT PLATFORM. PRESSING LEFT CAUSES THEM TO MOVE MORE SLOWLY THAN THE SCREEN SCROLLS, ESSENTIALLY CONTINUING TO MOVE FORWARD BUT AT A REDUCED PACE. PRESSING RIGHT DOES THE OPPOSITE - SONSON AND TONTON WILL MOVE ACROSS THE PLATFORMS FASTER THAN THE SCREEN SCROLLS. THE DUO HAVE ONLY ONE ATTACK - THE ABILITY TO FIRE ENERGY BLASTS FROM THEIR STAVES. TOUCHING AN ENEMY OR AN UNFRIENDLY PROJECTILE CAUSES THE PLAYER TO LOSE A LIFE. IF A PLAYER HAS ANY ADDITIONAL LIVES, THEY WILL RETURN TO THE SCREEN RIDING ON A CLOUD THAT WILL GIVE THEM TEMPORARY INVINCIBILITY. IF THE PLAYER PRESSES THE CONTROL STICK IN ANY DIRECTION, THE CLOUD WILL DISAPPEAR AND THE CHARACTER WILL RESUME ITS USUAL WALKING MODE. THE CLOUD WILL EVENTUALLY DISAPPEAR ON ITS OWN IF THE CONTROL STICK IS NOT USED.</desc>

A PEACEFUL KINGDOM IS UNDER ASSAULT BY THE ENCROACHING GOBLIGAN EMPIRE, LED BY A MYSTERIOUS HUMAN LEADER KNOWN ONLY AS THE GOBLIGAN KING. AS THE KINGDOM FINDS ITSELF UNABLE TO DRIVE OFF THE GOBLIGAN EMPIRE'S ADVANCES, KING CODWENNA ANNOUNCES A HUGE BOUNTY FOR THE GOBLIGAN KING'S HEAD.

CHARACTERS
GAIN, THE WARRIOR: A MASTER OF SWORDS AND PHYSICAL COMBAT, GAIN WANDERS THE LAND WITH HIS PET MONKEY SHAIN IN SEARCH OF THE ULTIMATE WEAPON.

		<desc>AFTER EXHAUSTING THE EARTH'S RESOURCES, PARTICULARLY FOSSIL FUEL, INNUMERABLE TRADE COMPANIES TEAM UP WITH NASA AND BEGIN INITIATING SPACE PROGRAMS DEDICATED TO FINDING RESOURCES OUTSIDE THE PLANET EARTH. MINING FACILITIES ARE ESTABLISHED IN DIFFERENT AREAS OUTSIDE OF EARTH, PARTICULARLY ON LARGE ASTEROIDS NEAR THE MOON AND MOST ESPECIALLY ON MARS. VARIOUS RESOURCES ARE FOUND FROM THESE AREAS AND DISTRIBUTED TO EARTH WHICH AID IN THE WORLD ECONOMY. THE LARGEST COMPANY THAT IS ESTABLISHED FROM THIS IS THE JIN-SEI (EXHAUSTING STAR) CORPORATION SET IN JAPAN WHICH IS WORTH 1 TRILLION IN NEW YEN INVESTMENTS, FOUNDED BY THE MIAMA FAMILY.

HOWEVER, AFTER YEARS OF SPACE RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION, THE SEPARATE COMPANIES STARTED INITIATING ATTACKS THAT WOULD DOMINATE OTHER COMPANY'S RESOURCES. THE STRONGEST OF THESE ATTACKS STARTED ON MARTIAN COLONIES ESTABLISHED BY THE SECOND LARGEST COMPANY ON EARTH, EIGHT LUCK INTERSTELLAR DEVELOPMENT INC., WHICH BANDED WITH SMALLER COMPANIES ACROSS EARTH INCLUDING ONES IN CHINA, ENGLAND, AND AMERICA. EIGHT LUCK PLANNED ON CLAIMING MARS FOR ITS OWN SO AS TO MONOPOLIZE ON THE OUTSOURCING OF MINERALS AS WELL AS DEVELOPING TERRAFORMED AREAS.

IN RESPONSE TO THESE ATTACKS, THE JIN-SEI FORMED A UNION WITH THE JDF (A FUTURE VERSION OF THE JSDF) AND BEGAN WORKING ON A SPACE FIGHTER PROGRAM ORGANIZED BY DEFENSIVE SECTION 2 OF THE JDF KNOWN AS THE SOUKYUGURENTAI (SOQ FOR SHORT), WHICH UTILIZED A UNIQUE LASER TECHNOLOGY FIGHTING SYSTEM KNOWN AS NALS (NON-BLIND SPOT ALL RANGE LASER SYSTEM) IN COMBAT. THE THREAT OF ECO-TERRORISM WAS ON THE RISE AS OUT-SPOKEN ECOSYSTEM PROTECTIONISM GROUPS OPPOSED THE COMPANY'S OUTSOURCING OF MATERIALS; THESE WERE USED AS SUBSEQUENT COVER-UP STORIES TO HIDE THE COMPANY WAR WAGING BETWEEN JIN-SEI AND EIGHT LUCK FROM PUBLIC AWARENESS. MADE UP OF THE BEST FIGHTERS ADAPTED TO THIS COMBAT SYSTEM AS WELL AS INNUMERABLE STAMINA STRENGTHENING TESTS FOR SPACE TRAVEL, THE SOQ ARE SENT IN TO DEFEND COMPANY TERRITORY FROM RIVAL COMPANIES ON EARTH AND SPACE AT ALL COSTS.</desc>

		<desc>LES VERSIONS PARODIQUES DE SPACE INVADERS SONT PRESQUE UN GENRE À PART ENTIÈRE, UN GENRE DONT SPACE BOMBER EST UNE BELLE INCARNATION. APRÈS UNE INTRO KITSCHISSIME QUI MET TOUT DE SUITE DANS LE BAIN (LES MÉCHANTS ALIENS ARRIVENT, OUH! PABO!), ON ATTAQUE UNE PARTIE D'UN JEU COMPLÈTEMENT À L'OUEST. 
SUR LES BASES DONC D'UN SPACE INVADERS (PAS DE SCROLLING, ENNEMIS QUI ARRIVENT D'EN HAUT) LE JEU AJOUTE UNE PLUS GRANDE LIBERTÉ DE MOUVEMENT, UN SYSTÈME DE POWER UPS MAIS SURTOUT UN SYSTÈME DE CAPTURE D'ENNEMIS: LE VAISSEAU DISPOSE D'UN GRAPPIN LUI PERMETTANT DE KIDNAPPER ET DE STOCKER JUSQU'À 3 ADVERSAIRES. ON PEUT ENSUITE S'EN RESSERVIR COMME ARME: CHAQUE TYPE D'ENNEMI CAPTURÉ AYANT UN EFFET DIFFÉRENT, LES POSSIBILITÉS SONT TRÈS NOMBREUSES, AVEC PAS MAL DE GAGS DÉBILES À LA CLÉ. 
LE JEU JOUE SURTOUT EN EFFET LA CARTE DU COMIQUE, AVEC DES ENNEMIS ASSEZ AHURISSANTS (COCHON GÉANT ET POUBELLE VOLANTE NE SONT QUE DES APERÇUS...), ET SUR UN GAMEPLAY EXCELLENT ET TRÈS DRÔLE, SURTOUT (COMME D'HABITUDE DANS CE GENRE DE JEUX) À DEUX JOUEURS. LES GRAPHISMES SONT ASSEZ SPÉCIAUX, DANS UNE 3D PAS TOUJOURS TRÈS RÉUSSIE MAIS ASSEZ ORIGINALE.</desc>

THE ALIEN CRAFTS ARE ARRANGED IN ROWS AND THEY SLOWLY MOVE LEFT AND RIGHT ACROSS THE SCREEN. WHEN THE ROW REACHES THE EDGE, THE SHIPS DROP DOWN A ROW AND MOVE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION (ONE EXCEPTION: SEE BELOW). AS YOU SHOOT MORE ENEMIES THE SPEED WILL INCREASE, AS WILL THE NUMBER OF ENEMY BULLETS. YOU HAVE FOUR BLOCKS ABOVE YOU THAT ABSORB THE ENEMY SHOTS UNTIL THEY ARE WORN THROUGH, AND BEING HIT BY AN ENEMY SHOT WILL COST YOU A LIFE. SOMETIMES A UFO WILL FLY ALONG THE TOP OF THE SCREEN; HIT IT AND YOU'LL GET POINTS AND A SMALLER ALIEN, HIT THE SMALLER ALIEN AND GET MORE POINTS.

THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT GAME MODES FOR 1- OR 2-PLAYER GAMES:
GAME A: ALIENS GO DOWN TWO, UP ONE, DOWN TWO, UP ONE.
GAME B: ALIENS SHOW UP IN ONE UP-AND-DOWN ROW, THEY ADD A ROW EACH TIME THEY REACH THE EDGE AND TURN AROUND.
GAME C: THE SAME AS "SPACE INVADERS" - ALL THE ALIENS MOVE AS ONE 'BLOCK' IN THE SAME DIRECTION.</desc>

		<name>Space Firebird</name>
		<desc>SPACE FIREBIRD IS A ONE OR TWO PLAYER GAME IN WHICH PLAYERS ARE ATTACKED FROM ALL SIDES BY HIGHLY MANEUVERABLE FIREBIRDS. PLAYERS CAN MOVE SPACE SHIP LEFT OR RIGHT AND SHOOT A RAPID-FIRE LASER AT ATTACKING FIREBIRDS. A SPECIAL WARP MODE ALLOWS THE SPACE SHIP TO ESCAPE DANGER AND FIRE AT THE FLOCK OF ALIENS.

FIREBIRDS
THE SPACE FIREBIRDS ARE A UNIQUE SET OF ADVERSARIES. THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT BIRDS, THE EMPEROR, EAGLE AND GULL, WHICH FLY TOGETHER IN COMPLEX LOOPING FORMATIONS, FIRING AND ATTACKING FROM ALL DIRECTIONS. THE PLAYER MUST KEEP TRACK OF THE LASER HITS BECAUSE EACH BIRD HAS A DIFFERENT RESISTANCE LEVEL TO HITS. THE FEARLESS EMPEROR IS DESTROYED BY FOUR HITS, THE EAGLE WITH TWO HITS AND THE SOARING GULL WITH ONE HIT. THE EAGLE ALSO HAS A DEADLY BOMB WHICH IS LAUNCHED AT THE SPACE SHIP. EXTRA POINTS ARE SCORED BY HITTING THE BOMB BEFORE IT EXPLODES. THE BOMB WHEN HIT, SCATTERS INTO DEADLY SHRAPNEL. TO AVOID THE FLYING SHRAPNEL, THE BOMB MUST BE HIT FROM DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH.

SPACE SHIP
THE SPACE SHIP CAN BE MOVED RIGHT OR LEFT TO EVADE ATTACKING FIREBIRDS. DEPRESSING THE FIRE BUTTON ENABLES THE SPACE SHIP TO SHOOT ITS LASER AT APPROACHING FIREBIRDS. PLAYERS RECEIVE 3 (ADJUSTABLE) SPACE SHIPS PER PLAY.

WARP MODE
ACTIVATE WARP MODE TO ESCAPE IMPEDING DANGER OR TO STRIKE OUT AT APPROACHING BIRDS. THERE IS ONLY WARP MODE PER SPACE SHIP. WHEN ACTIVATED, THE SPACE SHIP IS LAUNCHED INTO SPACE WITH A FORCE FIELD AROUND IT THAT DEFLECTS ENEMY FIRE. IN WARP MODE, FIREBIRDS CAN BE ELIMINATED BY RAMMING INTO THEM OR BY FIRING AT CLOSE RANGE.

IF ALL FIREBIRDS ARE DESTROYED, THE PLAYER MOVES INTO A NEW BATTLE SEQUENCE THAT INCREASES IN DIFFICULTY. ONE NEW SPACE SHIP IS AWARDED FOR A SCORE OF 5,000 (ADJUSTABLE) POINTS. GAME ENDS WHEN ALL SPACE SHIPS ARE DESTROYED.</desc>

YOU BEGIN THE GAME IN THE CENTER OF FOUR STRANGE LOOKING SHAPES. THESE SHAPES ARE BOTH LEVEL SELECTS AND UPGRADES. RUN INTO ONE OF THEM AND IT WILL ADD ITSELF TO YOUR SHIP, AND THEN YOU GET TO DO THE LEVEL ASSOCIATED WITH IT. EACH LEVEL IS DIFFERENT MAINLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE WILDLY DIFFERENT SHOT PATTERNS ON EACH ONE. BUT ALL OF THEM ARE THE SAME WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR OBJECTIVE. WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS BLAST ALL THE SPACESHIP PARTS BEFORE THEY CAN FORM INTO DANGEROUS ENEMY SPACESHIPS. BLAST THEM ALL, AND YOU GET TO SELECT A NEW LEVEL AND WATCH A LITTLE INTERLUDE WHERE THE ALIEN TAUNTS YOU WITH HIS EVIL COMPUTER VOICE.</desc>

THE GAME'S ENEMIES ARE AS ABSTRACT AS ITS SETTING; WITH CREATURES INCLUDING PREHISTORIC MAMMOTHS, ALIEN PODS, GIANT MUSHROOMS AND, AT THE END OF MOST STAGES, A HUGE, FIREBALL-SPITTING CHINESE DRAGON.

THE PLAYER'S ON-SCREEN COUNTERPART CARRIES A PORTABLE JETPACK UNDER HIS ARM WHICH ALLOWS HIM TO FLY. THE PLAYER CAN ALSO RUN ALONG THE GROUND TO AVOID OVERHEAD STRUCTURES AND ENEMIES.

IN ADDITION TO ITS FLIGHT CAPABILITY, THE JETPACK IS ALSO EQUIPPED WITH A LASER, USED TO DESTROY BOTH THE GAME'S MANY ENEMIES AS WELL AS SOME (BUT NOT ALL) OBSTRUCTIONS, SUCH AS THE TREES AND FLOATING ROCKS ON THE FIRST STAGE.

SPACE HARRIER HAS A TOTAL OF 18 STAGES, EACH WITH A BOSS FIGHT AT THE END. THREE EXCEPTIONS ARE THE BONUS STAGES (5TH AND 12TH) AND THE 18TH STAGE, WHICH IS A 'BOSS RUSH' FEATURING SOME OF THE BOSSES ENCOUNTERED UP TO THAT POINT.</desc>

		<name>Spectar</name>
		<desc>SPECTAR, RELEASED BY EXIDY IN 1980, IS THE FOLLOW-UP OF "TARG". GAMEPLAY IS APPARENTLY UNCHANGED, YOU CONTROL A VEHICLE CALLED WHUMMEL INTO A 9X9 GRID MAZE, CHASING DOWN, AND BEING CHASED BY, THE ALIEN INVADERS. TARGS HAVE EVOLVED INTO THE MORE DANGEROUS RAMMERS, AND SPECTARS APPEARS MORE OFTEN, SHOOTING AT PLAYER'S SHIP.

YOU USE A 4-WAY JOYSTICK TO GUIDE YOUR VEHICLE IN THE MAZE, AND A PUSHBUTTON TO SHOOT AT ENEMIES. UP TO 2 PLAYERS CAN ALTERNATE IN GAMEPLAY.

THE MOST NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE FROM HIS PREDECESSORS IS THAT TO COMPLETE A LEVEL YOU CAN NOW COLLECT ALL THE GEMS IN THE MAZE, IN A "PACMAN"-LIKE GAME OR DESTROY ALL OF THE RAMMERS (LIKE IN "TARG"). RAMMERS AND SPECTARS CONTINUE TO APPEAR FROM FLASHING PODS, SO YOU CANNOT REST AND PLAN YOUR COURSE EASILY, OR YOU WILL BE OVERWHELMED BY THE ALIEN FORCE.

GRAPHIC IS HIGHLY IMPROVED COMPARED TO HIS PREDECESSOR: THE MAZE NOW HAS BARRICADES THAT MUST BE AVOIDED OR CAN BE USED AS A SHIELDING AGAINST THE ENEMIES, AND HAS TEN ENVIRONMENT SETTINGS, CHANGING FROM THE 'SQUARE-BLOCK TOWN' OF TARG TO A CITY, A FOREST, A LUNAR LANDSCAPE AND MANY MORE. THE ENEMIES TOO ARE SMARTER AND FASTER, AND THE FACT THAT THEY GO ON SPAWNING FROM THE PODS MAKES THE GAME A EVEN MORE FRENZY CHALLENGE.</desc>

TO DO THIS, THE SPELUNKER MUST FIND THE EXIT TO EACH CAVE, SO HE CAN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT AND GET CLOSER TO HIS GOAL.

SPELUNKER IS A PLATFORM GAME, AND EACH TRICKY CAVE IS FILLED WITH ENEMIES - SUCH AS BATS AND OGRES - AND TRAPS. LADDERS, ROPES, LIFTS AND THE OBLIGATORY MINECARTS MUST BE USED TO REACH OTHER PLATFORMS AND SECTIONS OF THE CAVE.

TO AID HIM IN HIS DIFFICULT QUEST, THE SPELUNKER CARRIES A GUN AND CAN SHOOT SHORT-RANGE FIREBALLS AT HIS ENEMIES TO STUN OR KILL THEM. NUMEROUS BONUS ITEMS CAN BE COLLECTED, SUCH AS BOMBS TO DESTROY ANY ROCKS BLOCK HIS ROUTE, KEYS TO OPEN LOCKED DOORS AND POTIONS TO BOOST THE CAVER'S EVER-DECREASING ENERGY METER. TREASURE CHESTS ALSO LITTER EACH CAVE, AND CAN BE OPENED FOR BONUS TREASURE ITEMS.</desc>

		<desc>IN THIS GAME YOU CONTROL A RACE CAR ON A SEMI-CIRCULAR TRACK. YOU ARE LOOKING DOWN ON THE ACTION FROM ABOVE. YOUR ONLY GOAL IS TO DRIVE AROUND THE TRACK AS MANY TIMES AS POSSIBLE, AND AS FAST AS YOU CAN. THERE WILL BE FOUR CARS ON THE TRACK AT ALL TIMES (THE COMPUTER LETS YOU KNOW THAT 'GREY CARS DRIVE AUTOMATICALLY').YOU CONTROL THE WHITE CAR, WHILE THE COMPUTER CONTROLS A BLACK CAR AND TWO GREY CARS. THE GAME WILL RATE YOU AT THE END, YOU CAN GET RATED GRANNY, ROOKIE, OR PRO, AND GETTING A SCORE OVER 250 POINTS WILL EXTEND THE GAME AN EXTRA 30 SECONDS. THE GAME HAS SEVERAL DIFFERENT TRACKS AVAILABLE, AND THEY CHANGE RANDOMLY THROUGHOUT THE GAME (THEY LITERALLY CHANGE WHILE YOU ARE STILL DRIVING). THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ORIGINAL "SPRINT 2", WHICH ALLOWED YOU TO SELECT YOUR TRACK MANUALLY. THE GRAPHICS ARE SIMPLE BLACK AND WHITE WITH TWO SHADES OF GRAY THROWN IN FOR GOOD MEASURE. THEY ARE SIMPLE, BUT THEY GET THE JOB DONE.</desc>

		<desc>SPY HUNTER IS AN ACTION/DRIVING GAME. IT PLACES THE PLAYER AS THE DRIVER OF A G-6155 CIA PROTOTYPE INTERCEPTOR SPORTS CAR. THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO TRAVEL THE FREEWAYS AND WATERWAYS, HUNTING DOWN AND DESTROYING AS MANY ENEMY VEHICLES AS POSSIBLE, ALL THE WHILE NOT HARMING CIVILIAN VEHICLES. THE VIEW IS TOP-DOWN AND THE SCREEN SCROLLS VERTICALLY UNDERNEATH THE PLAYER'S CAR.

THE GAME BEGINS WITH THE PLAYER DRIVING THE G-6155. SOON, THE PLAYER STARTS TO ENCOUNTER ENEMY VEHICLES WHICH TRY TO FORCE THE PLAYER'S CAR OFF THE ROAD AND CRASH. EACH ENEMY VEHICLE HAS ITS OWN SPECIAL FEATURE, SUCH AS TIRE SLASHERS OR BULLETPROOF ARMOR.

POINTS ARE SCORED FOR DRIVING ON THE ROAD AND FOR DESTROYING ENEMY VEHICLES. THERE IS A LEAD-IN TIME WHEN THE PLAYER HAS AN ENDLESS SUPPLY OF CARS. AFTER THIS TIME EXPIRES, THE PLAYER WILL LOSE A LIFE EACH TIME THE CAR CRASHES. EXTRA CARS CAN BE EARNED WITH HIGH SCORES. THE FIRST EXTRA CAR IS EARNED AT A DEFAULT VALUE OF 30,000 POINTS, BUT THIS VALUE CAN VARY DEPENDING ON SETTINGS.</desc>

		<name>Star Castle</name>
		<desc>STAR CASTLE IS A 1- OR 2-PLAYER OUTER SPACE ACTION GAME DESIGNED WITH FEATURES GEARED FOR MAXIMUM PLAYER APPEAL: A PROGRESSIVELY DIFFICULT COMPETITIVE LEVEL AND A CLEARLY DEFINED ENEMY WHICH MUST BE BOTH ATTACKED AND AVOIDED AT VARIOUS POINTS IN THE COURSE OF PLAY.

THE CENTER OF THE PLAYFIELD IS OCCUPIED BY THE STAR CASTLE WHICH IS PROGRAMMED TO CONSTANTLY HOME IN ON THE PLAYERS' SHIPS. SURROUNDING THE STAR CASTLE ARE THREE CONCENTRIC ENERGY RINGS OF TWELVE SEGMENTS EACH, WHICH SERVE AS BOTH A PROTECTIVE PERIMETER FOR THE STAR CASTLE AND A SOURCE OF POINTS FOR THE PLAYER. CONTAINED WITHIN THE ENERGY RINGS ARE THREE PROTECTIVE MINES WHICH SEEK OUT THE PLAYERS' SHIPS AND DESTROY THEM UPON COLLISION. THE MOVEMENTS OF THE MINES ARE PROGRAMMED TO SIMULATE THE ACTIONS OF HEAT-SEEKING MISSILES.

THE OBJECT OF THE GAMES OF STAR CASTLE IS TO SCORE THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF POINTS POSSIBLE. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE COMBINATION OF THREE ELEMENTS:
A) EXPLODING THE RING SEGMENTS.
B) EXPLODING THE STAR CASTLE.
C) AVOIDING THE STAR CASTLE'S MINES. A PLAYER'S TURN IS OVER WHEN HIS SHIP HAS BEEN DESTROYED. THE NUMBER OF SHIPS PER GAME IS SET BY THE OPERATOR.

FOR MAXIMUM SCORING, A PLAYER WILL WANT TO SHOOT OUT SECTIONS OF THE ENERGY RINGS IN ORDER TO GIVE HIM A SHOT AT THE STAR CASTLE IN THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN. AS PLAY PROGRESSES, THERE ARE 2 FACTS A PLAYER MUST KEEP IN MIND:
1) EXPLODING ALL SEGMENTS IN A GIVEN RING WILL CAUSE THE ENTIRE RING TO REAPPEAR - THEREBY ELIMINATING A POTENTIAL SHOT AT THE STAR CASTLE IN THE CENTER.
2) EXPLODING THE RINGS IN A MANNER THAT GIVES YOU A SHOT AT THE STAR CASTLE WILL ALSO GIVE THE STAR CASTLE A SHOT AT YOU. THE STAR CASTLE IS PROGRAMMED SO THAT ITS NOSE ALWAYS SEEKS OUT THE PLAYER'S SHIP. IF THERE IS AN OPEN SHOT AT THE PLAYER, IT WILL TAKE IT.

WHEN THE STAR CASTLE IS HIT BY A PLAYER'S MISSILE, IT WILL FIRST IMPLODE AND THEN EXPLODE WITH ALL REMAINING RING SEGMENTS. AFTER A ONE-SECOND DELAY, THE STAR CASTLE WILL REAPPEAR WITH ALL THREE RING SEGMENTS. IF THE STAR CASTLE SHOOTS THE PLAYER, HIS TURN IS OVER.

AS PLAY BEGINS, THE STAR CASTLE WILL APPEAR IN THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN SURROUNDED BY ITS 3 ENERGY RINGS. THE PLAYER'S SHIP APPEARS ABOUT HALFWAY UP ON THE RIGHT HAND EDGE. BY USING THE CONTROL BUTTONS TO MOVE FORWARD, RIGHT OR LEFT, THE PLAYER MANEUVERS ABOUT THE SCREEN USING THE FIRING BUTTON TO LAUNCH MISSILES.

POINTS ARE SCORED BY DESTROYING THE ENERGY RING SEGMENTS OR THE STAR CASTLE ITSELF. EXPLODING THE STAR CASTLE GIVES AN EXTRA SHIP AS WELL AS POINTS. NO POINTS ARE GIVEN FOR THE MINES THAT ATTACK THE PLAYER.

THE PLAYER'S SHIP CAN BE DESTROYED IN 2 WAYS: BY COLLISION WITH THE MINES OR BY A HIT FROM THE STAR CASTLE'S TORPEDO. THE MINES ARE LAUNCHED FROM THE RINGS AND ATTACK THE PLAYER FOR APPROXIMATELY TEN SECONDS OR UNTIL SHOT. THE STAR CASTLE'S TORPEDOES ARE LAUNCHED ONLY WHEN THERE IS A CLEAR SHOT AT THE PLAYER THROUGH ALL 3 RINGS. AT THIS TIME THE PLAYER ALSO HAS HIS SHOT AT THE STAR CASTLE. BOTH THE STAR CASTLE AND THE MINES GET SMARTER AND FASTER AS THE GAME PROGRESSES.

THE GAME OF STAR CASTLE IS NOT BASED ON TIME UNITS. THE BATTLE RAGES ON UNTIL ALL THE PLAYERS' SHIPS ARE DESTROYED. THE LENGTH OF THE GAME DEPENDS SOLELY ON THE SKILL OF THE PLAYER. IT'S THE AGE-OLD CHALLENGE OF MAN VERSUS MACHINE.</desc>

SPECIAL SYMBOLS APPEAR AT REGULAR INTERVALS THAT CAN BE SHOT OR COLLECTED FOR BONUSES AND POWER-UPS. THE FINAL STAR IS ONLY EQUIPPED WITH FORWARD-FIRING GUNS BUT THESE CAN BE UPGRADED OCCASIONALLY BY COLLECTING THE RELEVANT POWER-UP. THIS RESEMBLES A SMALL SPACE SHIP AND DOUBLES THE LENGTH OF THE FINAL STAR, WHILE ALSO INCREASING ITS FIRE-POWER. 

THE STAGES IN STAR FORCE ARE DESIGNATED BY LETTERS OF THE GREEK ALPHABET AND EACH HAS AN END-OF-LEVEL GUARDIAN IN THE FORM OF A GREEK LETTER THAT MUST BE DEFEATED TO PROGRESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL. THE GUARDIAN MOVES DOWN THE SCREEN AND IF THE PLAYER FAILS TO DESTROY IT BEFORE IT DISAPPEARS FROM VIEW, THEY WILL HAVE A PLAY A LITTLE MORE OF THE LEVEL IN ORDER TO REACH THE GUARDIAN AGAIN.</desc>

THIS GAME IS SPECIFICALLY BASED ON THE VERY FIRST STAR WARS MOVIE, 'EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE'. THE PLAYER TAKES ON THE ROLE OF LUKE SKYWALKER (RED FIVE) WHOSE GOAL IS TO BLOW UP THE INFAMOUS "DEATH STAR" BY FIRING A PROTON TORPEDO INTO AN EXPOSED EXHAUST PORT SITUATED ON THE DEATH STAR'S SURFACE. 

BEFORE REACHING THE EXHAUST PORT, PLAYERS MUST SURVIVE THREE ATTACK PHASES. 

PHASE 1: THE GAME BEGINS IN OUTER SPACE ABOVE THE DEATH STAR. PLAYERS MUST ENGAGE IN A DOG FIGHT WITH DARTH VADER AND NUMEROUS ENEMY TIE FIGHTERS. ALL BUT VADER'S FIGHTER CAN BE SHOT AND DESTROYED. INCOMING ENEMY FIRE MUST BE AVOIDED OR SHOT TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE PLAYER'S DEFLECTOR SHIELDS. 

PHASE 2: THE X-WING FLIES DOWN TO THE SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR AND IS CONFRONTED WITH A BARRAGE OF LASER TURRETS AND TOWERS AS THE X-WING FLIES ACROSS THE DEATH STAR'S SURFACE. ANY COLLISIONS WITH EITHER THE TOWERS OR INCOMING ENEMY SHOTS WILL CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE PLAYER'S DEFLECTOR SHIELDS. 

THE LASER TOWER TOPS HAVE A PROGRESSIVE SCORING INCENTIVE THAT IS DISPLAYED AT THE TOP CENTER OF THE SCREEN, ALONG WITH THE NUMBER OF REMAINING LASER TOWER TOPS THAT NEED TO BE DESTROYED BEFORE THE X-WING ENTERS THE EXHAUST PORT TRENCH. IF THE PLAYER MANAGES TO DESTROY ALL OF THE TOWERS, A SIZEABLE POINT BONUS IS AWARDED. 

PHASE 3: THE X-WING BEGINS ITS APPROACH DOWN THE TRENCH OF THE DEATH STAR, HEADING FOR THE EXHAUST PORT SITUATED AT THE END OF THE TRENCH. THE TRENCH WALLS ARE LINED WITH RED LASER-GUN TURRETS THAT FIRE AT THE PLAYER AS HE MAKES HIS APPROACH. INCOMING FIRE MUST EITHER BE AVOIDED OR SHOT. TRENCH CATWALKS OF VARYING SHAPES AND HEIGHTS ALSO APPEAR IN LATER TRENCH RUNS. THESE MUST BE AVOIDED AS ANY COLLISION RESULTS IN DAMAGE TO RED 5'S DEFLECTOR SHIELDS. 

IF THE PLAYER SURVIVES THE TRENCH RUN, THE VOICE OF 'HAN SOLO' WILL ADVISE THAT 'YOU'RE ALL CLEAR, KID' AND THE PLAYER MUST QUICKLY SHOOT THE EXHAUST PORT TO DESTROY THE DEATH STAR. IF A TRENCH RUN IS COMPLETED WITHOUT THE PLAYER HAVING FIRED ANY SHOTS OTHER THAN THE SHOT INTO THE EXHAUST PORT, A SIZEABLE POINT BONUS IS AWARDED FOR 'USING THE FORCE'. IF THE EXHAUST PORT IS MISSED, RED 5 WILL PLOUGH THROUGH THE WALL AT THE END OF THE TRENCH AND LOSE ONE DEFLECTOR SHIELD, AFTER WHICH THE TRENCH RUN WILL START OVER. 

IF THE PLAYER SUCCEEDS IN BLOWING UP THE DEATH STAR, RED 5 MAKES ITS ESCAPE BEFORE TURNING TO VIEW THE COLOURFUL EXPLOSION. BONUS POINTS FOR REMAINING SHIELD ENERGY IS NOW SCORED. 

THE PLAYER IS THEN RETURNED TO THE FRAY AND WHOLE PROCESS BEGINS AGAIN. EACH SUCCESSIVE DEATH STAR RUN GREATLY INCREASES IN DIFFICULTY; TIE FIGHTERS SHOOT MORE OFTEN, THERE ARE MORE LASER TOWERS AND BATTERIES IN SUCCESSIVE ROUNDS AND THERE ARE MANY MORE OBSTACLES AND LASER FIRE DURING THE TRENCH RUN.</desc>

		<desc>STARBLADE IS A 3-D SPACE SHOOT'EM UP FEATURING 2 SEPARATE MISSIONS; THE FIRST IS TO DESTROY THE PLANET 'RED EYE' WHILE THE SECOND IS TO WIPE OUT THE ENEMY FLEET AND THEIR LEADER. THE GAME'S SIT-DOWN CABINET FEATURED A SEAT THAT VIBRATED WHENEVER THE PLAYER WAS HIT, EITHER BY INCOMING FIRE OR BY ENEMY OBJECTS SUCH AS SHIPS, ASTEROIDS ETC. THE YOKE JOYSTICK - WHICH HAD A FIRE BUTTON SITUATED AT THE TOP OF THE STICK, UNDERNEATH WHERE THE PLAYER'S THUMB SITS - WAS VERY SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE AND FEEL TO THAT USED IN ATARI'S 1983 WIREFRAME CLASSIC, "STAR WARS (ATARI)".</desc>

		<desc>EVEN PATTON WOULD SPEND ALL HIS QUARTERS ATTEMPTING TO ADVANCE THROUGH THE FOUR ATTACK LEVELS OF STRATEGY X, KONAMI'S LATEST TANK ATTACK VIDEO GAME.

1ST LEVEL: DEFEND AGAINST ROTATING CANNONS.
2ND LEVEL: WATCH OUT FOR ATTACKING JEEPS
3RD LEVEL: CAREFUL! HERE COME ATTACKING AND SHOOTING TANKS
4TH LEVEL: ROTATING CANNONS AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME AGAINST A MOVING BACKGROUND.

AN AUDIBLE SIGNAL WARNS THAT IT'S REFUELING TIME. ENTER A FUEL DOCK AND RECEIVE 100-300 POINTS. THE TANK COMMANDER'S LIFE ISN'T AN EASY ONE.

ASIDE FROM AN ON-GOING BATTLE, HE HAS TO WATCH OUT FOR OBSTACLES AND ROUGH TERRAIN. BRICK WALLS DESTROY TANKS, ALTHOUGH THEY CAN BE SHOT AWAY. TNT, RATHER NASTY STUFF...EXPLODES WHEN SHOT, BUT DESTROYS ALL OBJECTS IN THE AREA. STAY OFF PINK BACKGROUNDS. THAT'S WHERE THE LAND MINES ARE BURIED. THEY EXPLODE ONLY ON CONTACT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT A BLUE BACKGROUND, THOUGH. IT'S A SLIP ZONE LIKE AN OIL SLICK AND CAN BE DRIVEN ACROSS. IF AN ALIEN BASE IS FOUND AND DESTROYED, ADVANCE TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY. YOU BET THERE'S A 'BUY-IN' FEATURE ON THIS ONE.

STRATEGY X. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A WAR GAME LIKE IT. IT BLOWS MINDS, AND QUARTERS.</desc>

		<desc>IT'S STREET FIGHTER AS YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER IT, WITH SOME NEW MOVES, CHARACTERS AND COMBO SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS A MORE POLISHED LOOK AND FEEL.

THE NEW MOVES AVAILABLE FOR EACH FIGHTER, CALLED SUPER MOVES, ALLOW THEM TO FIRE OFF VERY POWERFUL MOVES. A BAR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN REPRESENTS THE POWER THAT YOU HAVE TO USE FOR THE MOVES. YOU START THE FIRST ROUND ON 0, AND EACH ATTACK THAT YOU MAKE ADDS POWER TO THE BAR. ONCE YOU REACH LEVEL 3, YOU CAN UNLEASH THE SPECIAL ATTACKS, THAT CAN SOMETIMES KO THE OPPONANT.

THE OTHER MAJOR CHANGE OVER THE STREET FIGHTER 2 SERIES ARE THE ALPHA COUNTERS. THESE CAN BE USED TO COUNTER AN ON-COMING ATTACK AFTER BLOCKING.</desc>

PLAYERS FLY A SPACESHIP OVER THE SURFACE OF THE OF PLANETS, DESTROYING ENEMY WAVES AND RESCUING HUMANS FROM THE ALIEN INVADERS, WITH RESCUED HUMANS HANGING FROM THE UNDERSIDE OF THE PLAYER'S SHIP. ONCE THESE TASKS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED, THE MOTHERSHIP ARRIVES TO PICK UP THE PLAYER'S SHIP, TOGETHER WITH ANY HUMANS THEY HAVE RESCUED. PLAYERS CAN DECIDE WHICH PLANETS TO ATTACK, WHEN TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL FIREPOWER AND WHEN TO ATTACK THE APOCALYPSE.

STRIKE FORCE ADDS SEVERAL NEW FEATURES TO THE SERIES. TWO PLAYERS CAN NOW SHARE THE SCREEN AT ONE TIME AND THE SURFACE OF EACH PLANET IS LITTERED WITH VARIOUS SPECIAL WEAPONS THAT CAN BE PICKED UP AND DEPLOYED. HUMANS CAN BE 'MUTATED' INTO SMALL GREEN CREATURES THAT WILL FIGHT AGAINST THE PLAYER (ALTHOUGH PLAYERS CAN STILL PICK THEM UP FOR POINTS AS, WITH THE UNMUTATED HUMANS).

		<desc>SUNSET RIDERS IS A HORIZONTALLY-SCROLLING PLATFORM SHOOT-EM-UP FOR UP TO FOUR PLAYERS SET IN AMERICA'S WILD WEST. FOUR SHARPSHOOTER BOUNTY HUNTERS (STEVE, BILLY, BOB AND CORMANO) SET OUT TO CLAIM THE BOUNTIES FOR KILLING THE MOST WANTED OUTLAWS IN THE WEST, BEFORE A FINAL SHOWDOWN AGAINST THE INFAMOUS SIR RICHARD DE LA ROSE.

THE ACTION TAKES PLACE BOTH ON FOOT AND ON HORSEBACK, WITH PLAY SOMETIMES BROKEN UP WITH A WILD WEST PURSUIT; SUCH AS HAVING TO RUN ALONG THE BACKS OF A HERD OF FLEEING BUFFALO. EACH LEVEL ENDS WITH PLAYERS ENTERING A ONE-ON-ONE BATTLE AGAINST ONE OF THE WANTED MEN THEY HAVE BEEN PURSUING. 

POWER-UPS AND BONUS ITEMS CAN BE OBTAINED BY ENTERING SALOONS OR DEFEATING CERTAIN SACK-CARRYING BANDITS. THE POWER-UPS COMES IN THE FORM OF EITHER A GOLDEN SHERIFF BADGE (THAT GIVES THE PLAYER'S WEAPON AUTO-FIRE) OR A SILVER BADGE THAT GIVES THE PLAYER A SECOND GUN (MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO SHOOT IN TWO DIRECTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY). BOTH POWER-UPS CAN BE EQUIPPED AT THE SAME TIME. 

OTHER WEAPONS THAT CAN BE USED BY PLAYERS INCLUDE STICKS OF DYNAMITE CARRIED BY FEMALE BANDITS THAT CAN BE THROWN BACK AT THE ENEMY BEFORE THEY EXPLODE AND A MOUNTED GATLING GUN AVAILABLE ONLY IN THE LAST STAGE. 

A BONUS MINI-GAME APPEARS AT THE END OF STAGES 2 AND 5 IN WHICH PLAYERS MUST SHOOT AT ENEMIES FROM A FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE BEFORE THE TIMER RUNS OUT.

SUNSET RIDERS FEATURES EIGHT STAGES OF PLAY.</desc>

		<name>Super Breakout</name>
		<desc>SUPER BREAKOUT ALLOWS THE PLAYER(S) TO SELECT ANY ONE OF THREE DIFFERENT ACTION-PACKED SUPER BREAKOUT GAMES BY TURNING THE GAME SELECT KNOB ON THE CONTROL PANEL TO THE DESIRED GAME. THE THREE AVAILABLE SUPER BREAKOUT MODES ARE THE FOLLOWING: 

DOUBLE BREAKOUT: BEFORE SERVING THE BALL, THE DOUBLE BREAKOUT PLAYFIELD CONTAINS 52 ORANGE BRICKS (4X13) AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN AND 52 GREEN BRICKS (4X13) IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE ORANGE BRICK WALL. 
TWO PADDLES ARE DISPLAYED AT THE BOTTOM END OF THE SCREEN. WHEN THE SERVE PUSHBUTTON IS PRESSED, TWO BALLS ARE SERVED. IF THE FIRST BALL SERVED IS MISSED, IT COUNTS AS A MISSED SERVE AND GOES AGAINST THE PLAYER'S ALLOTTED SERVES PER GAME. OTHERWISE THE SECOND BALL IS SERVED. IF THE SECOND BALL SERVED IS MISSED AFTER STRIKING THE FIRST SERVED BALL, THE PLAYER MAY CONTINUE WITH THE FIRST BALL. 

CAVITY BREAKOUT: BEFORE SERVING THE BALL, THE CAVITY BREAKOUT PLAYFIELD CONTAINS 44 ORANGE BRICKS AND 52 (4X13) GREEN BRICKS LOCATED IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE ORANGE BRICK WALL. AT APPROXIMATELY 3 COLUMNS IN AND 2 ROWS DOWN INTO THE ORANGE BRICK WALL, FROM BOTH THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE WALL, TWO CAVITIES APPEAR. THESE TWO CAVITIES OCCUPY THE SPACE OF 4 BRICKS (A 2X2 BRICK AREA).
ONE PADDLE IS PROVIDED IN THIS GAME, AND ONLY ONE BALL IS SERVED, UNLIKE IN DOUBLE BREAKOUT. WHEN ENOUGH BRICKS ARE REMOVED TO RELEASE A CAPTIVE BALL FROM ITS CAVITY, THE SCORE DOUBLES FOR EACH BRICK REMOVED BY ANY OF THE TWO BALLS IN THE PLAYFIELD (AS LONG AS THE SERVED BALL AND THE FREED BALL BOTH REMAIN ACTIVE IN THE PLAYFIELD). IF THE THIRD BALL IS FREED AND ALL THREE BALLS ARE PLAYED IN THE PLAYFIELD, THE SCORE TRIPLES. IF ANY ONE OF THE BALLS IS MISSED AND LOST, THE SCORE RETURNS TO DOUBLE POINTS. IF THE SECOND BALL IS MISSED AND ONLY ONE BALL REMAINS IN THE PLAYFIELD, POINTS ARE THEN SCORED AS NORMAL. 

PROGRESSIVE BREAKOUT: BEFORE SERVING THE BALL, THE PROGRESSIVE BREAKOUT PLAYFIELD CONTAINS 4X13 BRICK WALLS (ONE BLUE AND THE OTHER GREEN). THE BLUE BRICK WALL, WHICH CONSISTS OF 52 BRICKS, IS AT THE TOP. THEN OCCURS A SPACE EQUIVALENT TO THIS WALL. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN IS A GREEN BRICK WALL CONSISTING OF 52 BRICKS. 
THE BRICK WALLS MOVE OR 'SCROLL' TOWARD THE PADDLE AT A RATE DETERMINED BY THE NUMBER OF HITS ON THE BALL. AS THE BRICKS ARE KNOCKED OUT AND THE WALLS PROGRESSIVELY CREEP UP ON THE PLAYER'S PADDLE, NEW BRICKS ENTER THE PLAYFIELD AT A PROGRESSIVELY FASTER RATE. FOUR ROWS OF BRICKS ARE ALWAYS SEPARATED BY FOUR ROWS OF BLANKS. 
AS THE BRICK WALLS SCROLL DOWN, THEIR COLORS CHANGE, INDICATING A NEW POINT SCORE FOR THAT BRICK AT THAT INSTANT OF TIME.</desc>

SUPER BUG! SUPER THRILLS!

THE PLAYER DRIVE A BRIGHT YELLOW "MODIFIED BUG" SPEEDS THROUGH TREE-LINED CITY STREETS IN A FAST MOVING RALLY RACE. THE CONSTANTLY MOVING STREETS PROVIDE NEW EXCITEMENT AND DRIVING CHALLENGE EVERY TIME THE GAME IS PLAYED, AS THE DRIVER RACES THE CLOCK TO COVER AS MUCH DISTANCE AS POSSIBLE FOR HIGHEST SCORE.

DIRECTIONAL ARROWS APPEAR ON THE ROAD TO WARN DRIVERS AS THEY APPROACH TURNS. QUICK REFLEXES ARE A MUST TO AVOID CRASHING INTO CURBS AND PARKED CARS. AND TO AVOID SLIDING INTO OIL SLICKS AND SAND TRAPS.

PLAYERS CAN SELECT "NOVICE" OR "EXPERT" TRACKS, SHIFT INTO FIRST, STEP ON THE ACCELERATOR AND TAKE OFF. THE ROAR OF ACCELERATION, CRASH AND SKID SOUNDS ADD TO THE EXCIMENT. SCORE, FUEL (TIME REMAINING) AND DRIVER RATINGS ARE DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN, AS WELL AS "CRUNCH" WHENEVER THE PLAYER CRASHES.</desc>

THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO INVADE TEN SUPER COBRA DEFENSE SYSTEMS OF INCREASING DIFFICULTY AND SAFELY PICK UP THE BOOTY.

USE THE JOYSTICK TO MOVE UP, DOWN, ACCELERATE AND DECELERATE. USE THE LASER AND BOMBS TO DESTROY DEFENDERS. HITTING TANKS SCORES MYSTERY VALUE WORTH 100, 200, OR 300 POINTS. ROCKETS, TANKS, MISSILES, AND UFO'S MAY ALL FIRE AT INVADER. HIT FUEL TANKS FOR EXTRA FUEL FOR CHOPPER. THE CHOPPER USES UP FUEL AS IT FLIES, EXCEPT IN BETWEEN DEFENSE LEVELS.

AT 10000 POINTS, THE PLAYER IS AWARDED A BONUS CHOPPER.

AT THE END OF THE GAME, THE PLAYER CAN CONTINUE AT THE DEFENSE LEVEL HE LEFT OFF ON BY DEPOSITING EXTRA COINS AND PRESSING THE DISCHARGE BUTTON ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE PANEL.

IF THE BOOTY IS DESTROYED ON THE BASE LEVEL, THE PLAYER MAY TRY AGAIN. WHEN THE BOOTY IS SAFELY RECOVERED, A BONUS CHOPPER IS AWARDED AND PLAY RESUMES AT DEFENSE LEVEL NUMBER 1 WHERE THE FUEL IS USED UP FASTER AND THE DEFENDERS FIRE MORE OFTEN.

SUPER COBRA DEFENSE LEVEL DESCRIPTIONS:
 FUEL TANKS APPEAR ON EVERY DEFENSE LEVEL.
 TANKS APPEAR AND FIRE ON ALL LEVELS EXCEPT LEVEL 8 WHERE THEY DO NOT FIRE.
LEVEL 1 - PLAYER MUST MANEUVER THE CHOPPER OVER MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN AGAINST FAST AND SLOW FIRING ROCKETS.
LEVEL 2 - CHOPPER FACES ARCING MISSILES OVER A MOUNTAIN TERRAIN.
LEVEL 3 - SMART BOMBS FLYING IN GROUPS OF FOUR OVER MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN. ROCKETS APPEAR, BUT DO NOT FIRE.
LEVEL 4 - SINGLE SMART BOMBS OVER MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN. AGAIN, ROCKETS APPEAR BUT DO NOT FIRE.
LEVEL 5 - CHOPPER FLIES THROUGH A CAVERN-LIKE TERRAIN AGAINST FALLING MINES.
LEVEL 6 - RAPIDLY FIRING, ROVING TANKS OVER MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN. ROCKETS APPEAR, BUT DO NOT FIRE.
LEVEL 7 - MANEUVER THROUGH A FIELD OF METEORS WHICH EXPLODE WHEN HIT WITH BOMBS OR THREE TIMES WITH LASER, PLUS A SINGLE, GREEN, SHADOW METEOR DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF CHOPPER WHICH EXPLODES WHEN HIT FIVE TIMES WITH LASER. ROCKETS APPEAR BUT DO NOT FIRE.
LEVEL 8 - CHOPPER FLIES OVER MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN AGAINST RAPIDLY FIRING UFO'S. TANKS AND ROCKETS APPEAR, BUT DO NOT FIRE.
LEVEL 9 - CHOPPER FACES ARCING MISSILES OVER TALL BUILDINGS.

		<name>Super Hang-On</name>
		<desc>SUPER HANG-ON IS A CHECKPOINT-BASED RACING GAME AND IS THE SEQUEL TO THE ACCLAIMED "HANG-ON", RELEASED TWO YEARS EARLIER. AS WITH THE PREQUEL, PLAYERS TAKE CONTROL OF A SUPERBIKE AND MUST RACE OVER TWISTING ROAD-BASED CIRCUITS, AVOIDING RIVAL BIKERS AND TRYING TO REACH THE END-OF-STAGE CHECKPOINT BEFORE THE TIME LIMIT EXPIRES.

FOR THE SEQUEL, SEGA INTRODUCED THE HILLY, UNDULATING ROADS THAT HAD BEEN EXECUTED SO SUPERBLY IN 1986'S "OUT RUN". THE GAMEPLAY WAS FURTHER ENHANCED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE 'TURBO' BUTTON. UPON REACHING THE BIKE'S MAXIMUM SPEED OF 280KPH, PLAYERS COULD PRESS AND HOLD THE TURBO AND PUSH THE BIKE UP TO 324KPH - SOMETHING THAT WAS NECESSARY TO BEAT THE GAME'S EXTREMELY TIGHT TIME LIMITS. THIS HAD TO BE USED CAREFULLY, HOWEVER, AS THE INCREASE IN SPEED MADE THE BIKE HARDER TO CONTROL AND ACCELERATING AT THE WRONG TIME WOULD INVARIABLY SEE A HEAD-ON COLLISION WITH EITHER RIVAL BIKERS OR THE ROAD-SIDE OBJECTS THAT LITTER THE STAGES.

PLAYERS COULD CHOSE TO RACE ON ANY ONE OF FOUR COURSES: AFRICA, ASIA, AMERICA AND EUROPE. AFRICA IS THE EASIEST AND SHORTEST OF THE FOUR, WITH EACH SUBSEQUENT COURSE BECOMING BOTH MORE DEMANDING - WITH TIGHTER BENDS AND MORE AGGRESSIVE RIVAL RACERS - AND HAVING A GREATER NUMBER OF STAGES TO HAVE TO BEAT. AFRICA, FOR EXAMPLE, IS MADE UP OF ONLY SIX STAGES, WHILE THE HARDEST COURSE, EUROPE, HAS EIGHTEEN STAGES.</desc>

		<name>Super Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>SUPER PAC-MAN IS A 1- OR 2-PLAYER GAME WHERE YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF THE LEGENDARY PAC-MAN. AS IN THE ORIGINAL "PAC-MAN" GAME, THE GOAL IS TO CLEAR EACH MAZE, BUT THIS TIME, INSTEAD OF DOTS, THE MAZE CONSISTS OF PRIZES WHICH ARE LOCKED AWAY BEHIND GATES. THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO ACCESS THE PRIZES. YOU CAN EAT THE KEYS WHICH OPEN A PARTICULAR GATE, AND NOT ALWAYS THE GATE WHICH IS CLOSEST TO THAT KEY. OR YOU CAN CRASH THROUGH THE GATE AFTER YOU EAT A SUPER PILL AND BECOME SUPER PAC-MAN. YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO EAT ALL OF THE KEYS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE STAGE. 

FOUR POWER PILLS ARE IN MAZE AND ALLOW PAC-MAN TO TURN THE TABLES ON THE GHOSTS AND EAT THEM FOR A SHORT TIME. WHEN THE GHOSTS BEGIN TO FLASH, TIME IS RUNNING OUT AND THEY WILL SWITCH BACK, SO BEWARE. 

NEW IN THIS GAME IS THE SUPER PILL. THERE ARE TWO SUPER PILLS IN THE MAZE WHICH ALLOW PAC-MAN TO BECOME SUPER PAC-MAN FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME. WHILE IN SUPER FORM, PAC-MAN CAN CRASH THROUGH THE MAZE GATES, FLY OVER THE GHOSTS AND AVOID BEING KILLED (OR EAT THEM WHEN THEY'RE BLUE), AND TRAVEL AT SUPER SPEED WHENEVER THE PLAYER PRESSES AND HOLDS THE SUPER SPEED BUTTON. WHEN THE SUPER POWER IS ABOUT TO RUN OUT, PAC-MAN FLASHES WHITE AND THEN RETURNS TO HIS NORMAL FORM. YOU CAN EXTEND THE DURATION OF SUPER TIME BY EATING A REGULAR POWER PILL. THE SUPER TIME WILL THEN BE EXTENDED BY THE DURATION OF THE GHOSTS' BLUE TIME. 

PAC-MAN LOSES ONE LIFE WHENEVER A GHOST CATCHES HIM WHEN THE GHOST IS NOT BLUE AND PAC-MAN IS NOT IN SUPER FORM. YOU START WITH A SET NUMBER OF LIVES ('LIVES' DIP SWITCH), AND BONUS LIVES CAN BE AWARDED TO YOU AS YOU REACH OR PASS CERTAIN PRESELECTED POINT VALUES ('EXTRA LIVES' DIP SWITCH). 

THE TUNNEL IS A GREAT WAY TO PUT SOME SPACE BETWEEN YOU AND ANY GHOSTS THAT ARE ON YOUR TAIL SINCE THEY CAN ONLY MOVE HALF AS FAST AS YOU WHEN THEY ARE IN IT. IN SUPER PAC-MAN, THE GHOSTS ARE ALSO SLOWED DOWN BY TRAVELLING THROUGH THE PASSAGE DIRECTLY BENEATH THE GHOST PEN.

OCCASIONALLY, A STAR WILL APPEAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN WITH A PICTURE ON THE LEFT, AND A ROTATING PICTURE ON THE RIGHT. YOU MAY EAT THE STAR AT ANY TIME FOR BONUS POINTS, BUT IF YOU MANAGE TO EAT THE STAR WHEN THE RIGHT PICTURE MATCHES THE LEFT ONE, YOU WILL RECEIVE A LARGER BONUS. 

AS THE STAGES INCREASES, THE GHOSTS SPEED UP THEIR PURSUIT OF PAC-MAN AND THEY STAY BLUE FOR SHORTER AND SHORTER PERIODS OF TIME AFTER HE EATS A POWER PILL UNTIL, IN THE HIGH STAGES, THEY DO NOT TURN BLUE AT ALL. 

SUPER PAC-MAN ALSO FEATURES BONUS STAGES IN STAGE 3, STAGE 7, AND EVERY FOURTH STAGE THEREAFTER, WHERE THERE ARE NO GHOSTS, A TIME LIMIT, AND PAC-MAN IS IN SUPER FORM THROUGHOUT THE STAGE. YOUR GOAL IS TO EAT ALL OF THE PRIZES IN THE GIVEN TIME LIMIT. AS WITH GAMEPLAY ON THE REGULAR LEVELS, YOU DON'T NEED TO EAT ALL (OR ANY) OF THE KEYS. YOU ARE AWARDED THE REMAINING TIME IN THE COUNTER AS POINTS FOR SUCCESSFULLY EATING EVERYTHING. WITH EACH BONUS STAGE, THE WALLS AND GATES CHANGE COLOR.</desc>

		<desc>SUPER BANG IS A SEQUEL TO THE 1989 ORIGINAL IN WHICH ONE OR TWO PLAYERS CONTROL CHARACTERS ARMED WITH HARPOON GUNS WHO MUST DESTROY THE NUMEROUS DIFFERENT-SIZED BALLOONS THAT BOUNCE AROUND EACH SINGLE-SCREEN STAGE. WHEN HIT BY A HARPOON, THE BALLOONS BREAK DOWN INTO SMALLER FRAGMENTS, IN A SIMILAR FASHION TO ATARI'S 1979 CLASSIC, "ASTEROIDS". 

PLAYERS CAN ONLY FIRE THE HARPOON GUNS VIRTUALLY UPWARDS BUT CAN MOVE LEFT AND RIGHT AND CLIMB THE LADDERS THAT APPEAR ON MANY OF THE STAGES. THE GAME HAS TWO DIFFERENT MODES OF PLAY:

PANIC MODE
IN THIS MODE, PLAYERS FACE AN ENDLESS RAIN OF BUBBLES AND MUST SIMPLY LAST AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. THE DEFAULT WEAPON IS THE BUBBLE SHOT AND CANNOT BE CHANGED AT ANY TIME. EACH TIME A BUBBLE IS POPPED, A RAINBOW BAR AT THE BOTTOM IS SLOWLY FILLED. FILLING THE BAR ALL THE WAY RAISES THE LEVEL NUMBER AND THE BAR DEPLETES BACK TO ZERO. AS MORE BUBBLES ARE POPPED, BOTH REMAINING AND INCOMING BUBBLES MOVE FASTER. A 'PANIC' MUSIC PLAYS WHEN THERE'S A VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF BUBBLES ON THE SCREEN, BUT THE NORMAL MUSIC RETURNS ONCE ENOUGH BUBBLES ARE POPPED.

THERE IS ALSO ONE SPECIAL TYPE OF BUBBLE THAT APPEARS RARELY. THE BUBBLE HAS A CLOCK IMAGE ENGRAVED. WHENEVER THE BUBBLE BOUNCES, THE ENGRAVING CHANGES TO A STAR, AND WHEN THE BUBBLE BOUNCES AGAIN, THE ENGRAVING CHANGES BACK TO A CLOCK. POPPING THE BUBBLE WHEN THE CLOCK ENGRAVING IS PRESENT CAUSES ALL BUBBLES TO STOP MOVEMENT COMPLETELY FOR 9 SECONDS, WHILE POPPING THE BUBBLE WHEN THE STAR ENGRAVING IS PRESENT CAUSES ALL BUBBLES TO BE POPPED AND THE GAME SCREEN GETS CLEARED.

TOUR MODE
IN THIS MODE PLAYERS MOVE FROM STAGE TO STAGE, TRAVELLING AROUND THE WORLD. THE INTRODUCTORY STAGE IS SET IN JAPAN AND IS THE ONLY STAGE SET IN THIS LOCATION. AFTER JAPAN, PLAYERS TRAVEL TO PARTS OF ASIA, EUROPE AND THE AMERICAS. EACH LOCATION HAS THREE STAGES, WITH EACH SET AT A DIFFERENT TIME OF DAY: DAYTIME, EVENING AND NIGHT. THE FEW EXCEPTIONS TO THE THREE-STAGE RULE ARE VENICE (EVENING AND NIGHT STAGES ONLY), THE MAYAN RUINS AND THE CARIBBEAN SEA (BOTH HAVING ONLY DAY AND EVENING STAGES).

EACH STAGE HAS A SET LAYOUT, CONSISTING OF WALLS, DESTRUCTIBLE GLASS WALLS, INVISIBLE WALLS, LADDERS AND ICE. THERE ARE FORTY DIFFERENT STAGES IN THE TOUR MODE.</desc>

		<desc>SUPER PUNCH-OUT!! IS AN UPDATE OF THE SUPERB BOXING GAME, "PUNCH-OUT!!", FEATURING FIVE NEW LARGER-THAN-LIFE OPPONENTS. THE PLAYER ONCE AGAIN ASSUMES THE ROLE OF A GREEN-HAIRED BOXER WHO MUST FIGHT HIS WAY UP THROUGH FIVE BOXERS TO EARN THE TITLE OF 'CHAMP'. 

AS WITH THE ORIGINAL GAME, THE PLAYER'S BOXER IS VIEWED FROM BEHIND WITH HIS TORSO RENDERED WITH WIRE-FRAME GRAPHICS (ALLOWING THE PLAYER'S OPPONENT TO BE EASILY SEEN). PUNCHES, DODGES AND BLOCKS MUST ALL BE WELL-TIMED IN ORDER TO DEFEAT THE OPPONENT. 

BOTH THE PLAYER AND THE OPPONENT HAVE STAMINA METERS DISPLAYED AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. THESE DECREASE WHEN EITHER BOXER TAKES A PUNCH AND BOXERS WILL GET KNOCKED DOWN IF THEIR STAMINA METER RUNS OUT COMPLETELY. FASTER KNOCKDOWNS WILL CAUSE THE FALLEN BOXER TO RECOVER LESS STAMINA UPON GETTING UP; THE SAME HAPPENS IF A BOXER IS KNOCKED DOWN BY A KNOCKOUT PUNCH. 

THANKS TO THE REFINED ROSTER OF NEW AND HUGELY DISTINCTIVE ENEMY FIGHTERS, SUPER PUNCH-OUT!! IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE FIRST GAME.</desc>

		<desc>EXPORT VERSIONOF "MAJESTIC TWELVE - THE SPACE INVADERS PART IV".
THE THIRD SEQUEL TO TAITO'S SEMINAL "SPACE INVADERS", MAJESTIC TWELVE LEAVES THE CLASSIC INVADERS GAME-PLAY INTACT, BUT ADDS A SLEW OF NEW ALIEN INVADERS AND POWER-UPS TO THE MIX. THIS, TOGETHER WITH THE VASTLY IMPROVED GRAPHICS THAT INTRODUCE COLORFUL NEW BACKDROPS - SOME OF WHICH SCROLL VERTICALLY IN A SIMILAR FASHION TO THE STAR-FIELD IN NAMCO'S "GALAXIAN" - ENSURE THAT MAJESTIC 12 IS A WORTHY SEQUEL TO THE LEGENDARY ORIGINAL.

THE ORIGINAL GAME'S FLYING SAUCER STILL MAKES AN APPEARANCE, BUT INSTEAD OF MERELY AWARDING BONUS POINTS WHEN SHOT - AS IN THE ORIGINAL GAME - IT NOW DROPS A POWER-UP POD FOR THE PLAYER TO RETRIEVE. POWER-UPS INCLUDE SHIELD, FASTER SHOTS, A LASER (ACTIVATED WITH THE SECOND BUTTON) AND A GIANT BUTTERFLY, WHICH FREEZES THE INVADERS FOR A LIMITED TIME.

ONE OF THE GAME'S MOST MEMORABLE FEATURES WAS THE 'CATTLE MUTILATION' BONUS SCREEN, IN WHICH THE PLAYER MUST PROTECT A HEARD OF CATTLE FROM A NUMBER OF FAST-MOVING SAUCERS, INTENT ON STEALING THE ANIMALS. IF A COW IS SNATCHED; THE PLAYER MUST SHOOT THE RELEVANT SAUCER TO FREE IT; BEING CAREFUL NOT TO ACTUALLY SHOOT THE COW ITSELF. THE '91 INCARNATION ALSO INTRODUCED 'BOSSES' TO THE SERIES FOR THE FIRST TIME; GIANT, SCREEN-FILLING ALIENS THAT REQUIRED SEVERAL SHOTS TO KILL.

ANOTHER MAJOR DIFFERENCE TO THE PREVIOUS GAMES IN THE SERIES IS THAT IF AN INVADER REACHES THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, THE PLAYER WILL SIMPLY LOSE A SHIP (IN THE ORIGINAL, THE GAME WOULD END ONCE AN ALIEN HAD LANDED). ALSO, THE PLAYER'S SHIP NOW COMES EQUIPPED WITH A SHIELD THAT CAN WITHSTAND SEVERAL HITS. THE SHIELD'S STRENGTH IS DEPLETED EVERY TIME IT TAKES A DIRECT HIT FROM ONE OF THE INVADERS, AND TOO MANY HITS WILL RESULT IN THE SHIELD DISAPPEARING ALTOGETHER. A DIRECT HIT ON AN UN-SHIELDED SHIP WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF A PLAYER LIFE.</desc>

		<desc>LIKE "CHAMPIONSHIP SPRINT", RELEASED THE SAME YEAR, SUPER SPRINT IS AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE OLD ATARI SPRINT SERIES; WITH ADDED THE ABILITY TO ALLOW PLAYERS TO UPGRADE THEIR VEHICLES AS THE GAME PROGRESSES. UPGRADES ARE WON BY COLLECTING WRENCHES THAT APPEAR ONCE PER TRACK. AFTER A PLAYER HAS COLLECTED FOUR WRENCHES, THEY WILL BE PRESENTED WITH AN UPGRADE SCREEN; GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE BETTER TRACTION, INCREASED TOP SPEED, FASTER ACCELERATION, OR A FASTER HELICOPTER. THE ONLY DISCERNIBLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND "CHAMPIONSHIP SPRINT" IS THE ADDITION OF BRAND NEW TRACKS.</desc>

THE PLAYER MUST USE AN 8-WAY JOYSTICK AND A SINGLE BUTTON TO TAKE CONTROL OF A BLUE CELL, WHOSE OBJECTIVE IS TO SHOOT MEDICINE INTO VIRUSES THROUGH EIGHT MAZES MADE UP FROM RECTANGULAR VEINS AND THIN CELL MEMBRANES. EVERY VEIN, MEMBRANE, AND VIRUS THAT IS SHOT WILL DISAPPEAR FROM THE CURRENT MAZE. THE COLOR OF THE FIRST VIRUS YOU SHOOT WILL DETERMINE THE COLOUR OF RESURRECTED ONES; AND ONCE EVERY VIRUS ON THE SCREEN IS THE SAME COLOUR, THEY CAN NO LONGER BE SHOT. 

WHEN THE LAST MEMBRANE IN THE CURRENT MAZE IS DESTROYED, FOUR AID STATIONS WILL APPEAR IN THE CORNERS FOR A WHILE - YOU WILL HAVE TO GAIN EXTRA SHOTS BY REACHING ONE OF THEM BEFORE THEY TURN BACK INTO VEINS. EVERY TIME YOU REACH AN AID STATION AND GAIN EXTRA SHOTS, YOU WILL ALSO GAIN A WHITE CELL - ONCE YOU GAIN FIVE OF THESE, YOU WILL RECEIVE AN EXTRA LIFE.</desc>

AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH STAGE, YOU CAN "DRAW" A BARRIER BY PLACING LITTLE DOTS AROUND THE PLAYING FIELD. AFTER SEVERAL SECONDS, ENEMIES ARE RELEASED FROM THEIR BASES AND BEGIN TO SWARM THE SCREEN. THEY'LL USUALLY MAKE QUICK WORK OF THE BARRIER, BUT IF YOU SHOOT THE RED BALL IT'LL EXPLODE AND DESTROY ANYTHING NEAR IT. QUITE A COOL CONCEPT FOR SOMETHING FROM 1981 - IT'S A SHAME THAT TACTICIAN IS SO UNKNOWN, AND THAT THE IDEA WAS NEVER EXPANDED ON IN ANY OTHER GAMES. SOME VERSIONS LIST THE GAME AS COPYRIGHTED BY SEGA, BUT THEY APPARENTLY ONLY DISTRIBUTED THE GAME IN CERTAIN TERRITORIES.</desc>

		<desc>TERRA CRESTA IS A VERTICALLY-SCROLLING SHOOT-EM-UP SET OVER A CONSTANTLY SCROLLING LANDSCAPE OF ISLANDS AND ENEMY INSTALLATIONS. THE PLAYER IS UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM ENEMY SPACESHIP WAVES, GROUND-BASED GUNS AND TURRETS, DINOSAURS AND THREE DIFFERENT MOTHERCRAFT SHIPS. 

THE LEVELS ARE LITTERED WITH GROUND-BASED SILOS BEARING NUMBERS BETWEEN 2 AND 5. THESE CAN BE SHOT TO RELEASE A PLAYER SHIP COMPONENT, WHICH THEN ATTACHES TO THE PLAYER'S CURRENT SHIP, INCREASING BOTH ITS SIZE AND FIREPOWER. POWER-UPS AVAILABLE ARE 2-WIDE SHOT, 3-REAR SHOT, 4-FRONT CANNON AND 5-REAR SHIELD. 

USING THE 'FORMATION' BUTTON SPLITS THE SHIP PARTS INTO A FORMATION FOR LIMITED TIME, GIVING INCREASED FIRE POWER. THE NUMBER OF PARTS ACQUIRED DETERMINES THE FORMATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE PLAYER HAS PICKED UP TWO SHIP PARTS THEN A TRIANGLE IS FORMED, WITH THE PLAYER'S MAIN SHIP AT THE REAR OF THE FORMATION, WITH ADDITIONAL TWO SHIP COMPONENTS POSITIONED AT THE FRONT EDGE OF THE TRIANGLE. 

WHEN ALL FOUR NUMBERED PARTS HAVE BEEN COLLECTED, THE PLAYER'S SHIP TRANSFORMS INTO A FLAMING PHOENIX, AND IS INDESTRUCTIBLE FOR A LIMITED TIME.</desc>

YOU DETERMINE THE STRATEGIES HE WILL USE TO DEFEAT THE EVIL MONSTER VOLTAR WHO HAS INVADED THE EARTH, STEALING ALL TYPES OF TREASURES AND BURYING THEM DEEP WITHIN THE EARTH. VOLTAR ALSO TAKES HOSTAGES AND SEALS THEM IN VAULTS DEEP WITHIN THE EARTH.

THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO SAVE THE HOSTAGES AND RECOVER THE STOLEN TREASURES. WE MUST SEND IN ROTO. HE WILL FOLLOW VOLTAR RIGHT INTO HIS OWN HOME TUNNELS TO RESCUE THE HOSTAGES AND RECOVER THE STOLEN TREASURES VOLTAR HAS SALTED AWAY.

TO SAY THE LEAST, THIS MAKES VOLTAR MORE THAN JUST A LITTLE BIT UPSET WITH ROTO. TO HELP PROTECT HIS STOLEN TREASURES AND KIDNAPPED HOSTAGES. VOLTAR HAS DEVELOPED A BREED OF GIANT SPIDER THAT CAN SENSE ROTO'S LOCATION AND THAT CAN ALSO TRAVEL THROUGH SOLID EARTH. THESE SPIDERS ATTEMPT TO CORNER AND CAPTURE ROTO. AND TO DIRECT THEIR HUNT FOR ROTO, VOLTAR TURNS HIMSELF INTO A TROLL THAT CAN TRAVEL THROUGH SOLID EARTH.</desc>

EMPIRE FEATURES FOUR STAGES OF PLAY, WITH THE FIRST TWO PUTTING THE PLAYER IN CONTROL "LUKE SKYWALKER'S" SNOWSPEEDER, AND THE SECOND TWO IN CONTROL OF "HAN SOLO'S" MILLENNIUM FALCON.

THE FIRST LEVEL, PROBOTS, TAKES PLACE ON THE ICE PLANET OF HOTH, WITH THE PLAYER FLYING THE SNOWSPEEDER OVER THE PLANET'S SURFACE TO FIND AND DESTROY THE EMPIRE'S SEARCH DROIDS THAT ARE SENDING SIGNALS TO THE EMPIRE WARNING THEM OF THE REBELS' PRESENCE.
THE SECOND SNOWSPEEDER STAGE SEES THE PLAYER TAKING ON THE EMPIRE'S "AT-AT" IMPERIAL WALKERS, AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF SMALLER, BI-PEDAL "AT-ST" WALKERS. ON THIS LEVEL, AS WELL AS THE STANDARD GUNS, THE SNOWSPEEDER IS ARMED WITH A LIMITED NUMBER OF HARPOONS; THESE CAN BE FIRED AT THE AT-AT'S LEGS TO SEND THEM CRASHING TO THE GROUND. AT-ATS CAN ALSO BE DESTROYED BY SHOOTING A SMALL, HIGHLIGHTED AREA ON THE AT-ATS' HEAD.
THE THIRD LEVEL HAS THE PLAYER PILOTING THE MILLENNIUM FALCON AND IS A REPEAT OF THE ORIGINAL GAME'S IN-SPACE TIE FIGHTER BATTLE.
FOR THE FOURTH AND FINAL LEVEL THE PLAYER MUST PILOT THE MILLENNIUM FALCON SAFELY THROUGH A DENSELY PACKED AND FAST-MOVING ASTEROID FIELD.

BONUS POINTS CAN BE EARNED BY DESTROYING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF TARGETS. A JEDI LETTER WILL ALSO BE AWARDED IN ADDITION TO THE BONUS POINTS.

		<desc>A SUPERBLY PLAYABLE, HUMOUROUS AND UTTERLY UNIQUE SHOOT-EM-UP FROM THE DATE EAST STABLE. THE PLAYER BEGINS EACH LIFE IN CONTROL OF A BI-PLANE WITH A HUGE METAL HOOK ATTACHED TO ITS REAR. THIS HOOK CAN BE USED TO PICK UP ENEMIES, OBJECTS, BOMBS AND VEHICLES WHICH CAN THEN BE THROWN BOTH AT OTHER ENEMIES, AND AT ANY WALLS AND DOORWAYS THAT MAY BE BARRING THE PLAYER'S ROUTE.

IF THE BI-PLANE TAKES TWO HITS FROM ENEMY FORCES, IT WILL EXPLODE AND THE PLAYER IS FORCED TO CONTINUE ON FOOT. THE ON-FOOT SECTIONS PLAY IN A VAGUELY SIMILAR FASHION TO SNK'S LEGENDARY "METAL SLUG" SERIES, BUT WHILE ON FOOT, THE PLAYER HAS NO PROTECTION FROM ENEMY HITS AND IS VERY VULNERABLE TO ATTACK. AS SUCH, A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE (WHICH APPEAR IN THE FORM OF TANKS, MOTORBIKES, GIANT ROBOTS, ELEPHANTS ETC.) MUST BE FOUND QUICKLY.

BOOGIE WINGS FEATURES HIGHLY DETAILED AND COMPLETELY DESTRUCTIBLE SCENERY, WITH A MULTITUDE OF BACKGROUND ANIMATIONS MAKING THE GAME FEEL 'ALIVE' AND GIVING IT MUCH OF ITS DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER. THE GAME'S SETTINGS ARE AS ORIGINAL AS ITS GAMEPLAY; WITH MUSEUMS, FAIRGROUNDS, THE INSIDE OF SKYSCRAPERS ETC. ALL MAKING AN APPEARANCE. BOOGIE WINGS SOUNDTRACK IS ALSO UNIQUE TO THE GENRE, WITH A MIXTURE OF WELL-KNOWN JAZZ AND BLUES TUNES ACCOMPANYING THE FRENETIC ON-SCREEN ACTION.</desc>

		<desc>KARATE TOURNAMENT IS A ONE-ON-ONE FIGHTING GAME FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS, BASED ON THE ANCIENT AND MOST WELL KNOWN OF MARTIAL ARTS, KARATE.

PLAYERS ENTER A KARATE TOURNAMENT - HAVING FIRST SELECTED THEIR PREFERRED SKILL LEVEL, FROM EITHER WHITE, BROWN OR BLACK BELT - AND FIGHT AGAINST A NUMBER OF PROGRESSIVELY TOUGHER OPPONENTS. EACH VICTORY AWARDS THE PLAYER WITH A HIGHER BELT GRADE WITHIN THEIR CURRENT BELT COLOUR - WHITE GRADE SIX TO WHITE GRADE FIVE, FOR EXAMPLE - AND IF THE PLAYER WINS THE TOURNAMENT, HE OR SHE IS AWARDED A HIGHER BELT COLOUR AND THE GAME ENDS. IF PLAYERS CHOOSES TO PLAY THE GAME ON THE 'BLACK BELT' SKILL LEVEL, DEFEATING OPPONENTS IS AWARDED WITH A HIGHER GRADE, OR 'DAN' OF BLACK BELT.

KARATE TOURNAMENT USES A DISTINCTIVE GRAPHICAL TECHNIQUE IN THAT IT 'MORPHS' SOME OF THE COMBATANTS' MOVEMENT GRAPHICS TO SIMULATE SPEED AND MOTION BLUR. THE GAME WAS ALSO UNIQUE UPON ITS RELEASE IN THAT, IN A WORLD OF "STREET FIGHTERS" AND "MORTAL KOMBATS" - REPLETE WITH FANTASTICAL SPECIAL MOVES - KARATE TOURNAMENT WAS A GENUINE SIMULATION OF A RECOGNIZED MARTIAL ART; SOMETHING NOT REALLY SEEN SINCE THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF DATA EAST'S LEGENDARY GENRE-DEFINING FIGHTER, "KARATE CHAMP", RELEASED EIGHT YEARS' EARLIER IN 1984.</desc>

		<name>The Last Starfighter</name>
		<desc>AN ALIEN ENTREPRENEUR HAS PLACED STARFIGHTER GAMES MACHINES ON EARTH AS A TEST FOR PROSPECTIVE STARFIGHTERS. ALTHOUGH STARFIGHTER APPEARS TO BE ANOTHER ARCADE GAME, IT CONTACTS THE ALIEN WHEN THE HIGH SCORE RECORD IS BROKEN.

ALEX, A 19-YEAR OLD WHO LIVES IN A TRAILER PARK, IS AN ACE AT STARFIGHTER AND GETS WHISKED OFF TO THE PLANET RYLOS AS A DRAFTEE TO COMBAT THE EVIL XUR AND THE KO-DAN ARMADA. HAVING BEEN FOOLED INTO COMING, ALEX REFUSES AND IS RETURNED TO EARTH. WHILE ALEX IS GONE FROM RYLOS, A KO-DAN ATTACK DESTROYS ALL THE GUNSTAR SHIPS (STARFIGHTERS) AND CREWS, EXCEPT FOR A PROTOTYPE EQUIPPED WITH A SPECIAL WEAPONS SYSTEM CALLED DEATH BLOSSOM.

ALEXIS, MEANWHILE, CHANGES HIS MIND AND, WITH THE HELP OF THE ALIEN, RETURNS TO RYLOS WHERE, WITH NAVIGATOR/PILOT GRIGG, HE TAKES OFF IN THE LAST GUNSTAR TO TAKE ON THE WHOLE ENEMY FLEET. FIGHTING THROUGH A SERIES OF SPACE BATTLES, ALEX AND GRIGG SUCCEES IN SAVING THE UNIVERSE AND THEN RETURN TO EARTH TO PICK UP ALEX'S GIRLFRIEND BEFORE ASSUMING THE ROLE OF COMMANDER OF RYLOS ARMED FORCES AND BEING GIVEN THE HERO TREATMENT ON RYLOS.

BASIC GAMEPLAY:
PLAYER CONTROLS WEAPONS ON GUNSTAR AND ORIENTATION OF GUNSTAR CHAIR; HE IS NOT PILOTING SHIP. PLAYER'S HEAD-UP DISPLAY SHOWS INFORMATION ON WEAPONS SYSTEM AND COOLANT (SHIELDS), AS WELL AS ON CURRENTLY TARGETED ENEMY, SURROUNDING ENEMY POSITIONS AND GUNSTAR CHAIR ORIENTATION. NOT ALL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN EACH ROUND.

EACH OF THE ENEMY SHIPS TAKES A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO DESTROY. ENEMY CONDITION IS SHOWN BY THE 'TARGET TEMPERATURE GAUGE'. WHEN THE ENEMY TEMPERATURE HITS MAX, IT WILL EXPLODE. THE RATE AT WHICH THE GAUGE RISES IS DETERMINED BY THE TYPE OF SHIP. TEMPERATURE RISES WHILE PLAYER'S LASERS ARE CONTACTING ENEMY SHIP AND MAY FALL IF THIS CEASES BEFORE DESTRUCTION.

THE CONDITION OF THE GUNSTAR IS SHOWN BY THE 'HULL TEMPERATURE GAUGE'. WHEN THE GUNSTAR IS BEING HIT BY THE ENEMY FIRE, THE HULL TEMPERATURE INCREASES. WHEN THE HULL TEMPERATURE GETS HIGH, COOLANT FLOWS IN (AROUND THE GAUGE ON SCREEN FROM THE ON-SCREEN RESERVOIR) TO COLL THE HULL. THIS DEPLETES THE RESERVOIR OF COOLANT. IF NO COOLANT REMAINS, THE HULL TEMPERATURE WILL REACH MAXIMUM AND THE GUNSTAR IS DESTROYED. A COOLANT RECHARGE IS GIVEN AT THE END OF A COMPLETE ROUND.</desc>

YOU DRIVE YOU CAR AROUND THE MAZE, PICKING UP THE MONEY THAT IS LAYING AROUND EVERYWHERE (JUST LIKE THE DOTS IN "PAC-MAN"). NOW TO AVOID BEING ANY MORE LIKE" PAC-MAN", THE DESIGNER DECIDED TO GIVE YOU FOUR ENEMIES, WHO EACH MOVE AROUND THE MAZE WITH A DISTINCT PERSONALITY (BUT THEY ARE CARS, NOT GHOSTS). IN A FINAL ATTEMPT TO MAKE THIS GAME DIFFERENT FROM "PAC-MAN", THE DESIGNER THEN ADDED DOLLAR SIGNS IN EACH CORNER OF THE SCREEN, RUNNING OVER THESE ALLOWS YOU TO CHASE AFTER YOUR FOES, AND RUN OVER THEM (NOT AT ALL LIKE "PAC-MAN"). IN LATER LEVELS THESE DOLLAR SIGNS MAY BE IN PLACES OTHER THAN THE CORNERS (FINALLY, SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY IS DIFFERENT THAN "PAC-MAN"). EACH LEVEL IS FINISHED BY CLEARING ALL THE DOLLARS BILLS FROM THE BOARD (THE GAME WILL ALSO RATE YOU WITH A NEW 'CRIME LEVEL' EVERY TIME YOU COMPLETE A SCREEN).</desc>

USING BASIC CONTROLS: ACCELERATE WITH AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION, BRAKE AND A COMBINATION OF BOTH TO POWER DRIFT, YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW A SET PATH OF COURSES. IN THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP, EACH LOCATION CONSISTS OF DIFFERENT STAGES THAT NEED TO BE FINISHED IN A SINGLE RUN. THERE IS A STRICT TIME LIMIT AND YOU RECEIVE A TIME BONUS UPON FINISHING A SECTION. THE DAKAR MODE IS ONE LONG TRACK WITHOUT STOPS. THE CHAMPIONSHIP USES REGULAR CARS, BUT IN THE DAKAR RACE YOU CAN ALSO CHOOSE A SAND BUGGY, OFF-ROAD BIKE OR A TRUCK.

A GLOBAL RANKING IS KEPT WHILE RACING, BUT IT IS BASED ON YOUR TIME, NOT ON THE NUMBER OF CARS YOU PASS DURING THE RACE. ASIDE FROM YOUR OPPONENTS, YOU'LL ALSO FIND WATER, ANIMALS, HILLS, BRIDGES, BUSHES AND DIFFERENT OBSTACLES IN YOUR PATH.</desc>

THUNDER BLADE CONSISTS OF FOUR STAGES, WHICH ARE AS FOLLOWS:
STAGE 1: THE GAME BEGINS IN A SKYSCRAPER-PACKED CITY. ENEMIES CONSIST OF RIVAL CHOPPERS, JETS, AND GROUND-BASED TANKS AND GUN EMPLACEMENTS. THE LEVEL ENDS OVER THE SEA, WITH THE PLAYER FACING A HUGE AND HEAVILY-ARMED BATTLESHIP. 
STAGE 2: THIS STAGE BEGINS WITH THE PLAYER NAVIGATING A DESERT CANYON, BEFORE SWITCHING TO THE INTO-THE-SCREEN VIEW AND TAKING THE PLAYER THROUGH A NUMBER OF STALACTITE-PACKED AND DENSELY POPULATED CAVES. A HUGE GROUND-BASED TANK AWAITS THE PLAYER AT THE END OF THE STAGE.
STAGE 3: THIS BEGINS IN A RIVER CANYON, BEFORE MOVING ON TO A RAIN-FOREST RIVER NETWORK. AS WELL THE THE USUAL LINE-UP OF ENEMIES, HEAVILY-ARMED BOATS ARE INTRODUCED. THE END-OF-LEVEL BATTLE TAKES PLACE IN THE SKIES AS THE PLAYER ATTEMPTS TO DESTROY A MASSIVE JET FIGHTER.
STAGE 4: THE 4TH AND FINAL STAGE BEGINS WITH A REPEAT OF THE FIRST STAGE'S CITY LEVEL, ONLY THIS TIME THE ACTION TAKES PLACE AT NIGHT. THE SECOND HALF OF THIS STAGE TAKES THE PLAYER DEEP INTO AN INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX, EVENTUALLY LEADING TO AN END-OF-GAME SHOWDOWN WITH A MASSIVE AND HEAVILY-ARMED GUN EMPLACEMENT.</desc>

DURING A ROUND PLAYERS MUST AVOID BEEHIVES THAT ARE THROWN AT THEM BY GRIZZLY BEARS. THE BEEHIVES, HOWEVER, CAN BE DESTROYED WITH THE PLAYER'S AXE FOR A 500-POINT REWARD. SOME TREES CONTAIN BIRDS THAT WILL RUN AROUND THE LEVEL AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CHOPPED DOWN, AWARDING 1,000 POINTS IF TOUCHED BY THE PLAYER.

EVERY COUPLE OF LEVELS PLAYERS ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO AMASS BONUS POINTS. THE BONUS ROUND BEGINS WITH THE LUMBERJACK STANDING ON A FLOATING LOG. AS THE LOG BEGINS TO ROTATE, PLAYERS MUST USE THEIR REFLEXES TO STAY ON TOP OF THE LOG. THE FIRST TWO TIMES THIS IS PLAYED, THE LOG IS RELATIVELY LARGE; ON FUTURE ATTEMPTS, THE SIZE OF THE LOG SHRINKS CONSIDERABLY. THE BONUS ROUND ENDS IF THE PLAYER FALLS OFF THE LOG OR BALANCES ATOP IT FOR THE DURATION OF THE ROUND, IN WHICH CASE 1,000 BONUS POINTS ARE EARNED.

THE TWO-PLAYER SIMULTANEOUS MODE CAN BE PLAYED EITHER COMPETITIVELY OR COOPERATIVELY. IN THIS MODE, CHOPPING OR PUSHING DOWN A TREE SUCH THAT IT FALLS ON THE OPPONENT AWARDS YOU WITH 1,000 POINTS.</desc>

		<desc>TIME PILOT '84 IS AN EIGHT-WAY SCROLLING SHOOT 'EM UP AND IS THE SEQUEL TO 1982'S 'TIME PILOT'. AS WITH THE PREQUEL, THE GAME'S STAGES ARE SET OVER DIFFERENT PERIODS IN TIME. PLAYERS MUST DESTROY A SET NUMBER OF ENEMY SHIPS, AFTER WHICH AN END-OF-LEVEL GUARDIAN APPEARS. ONCE THIS IS DESTROYED THE PLAYER'S SHIP WARPS TO THE NEXT STAGE. 

THE PLAYER'S SHIP IS ARMED WITH BOTH A FORWARD-FIRING GUN AND AN INFINITE NUMBER OF HOMING MISSILES. EACH STAGE CONSISTS OF BOTH GREEN AND METALLIC ENEMIES, THE GREEN ENEMIES CAN BE DESTROYED WITH THE STANDARD GUN, BUT BOTH METALLIC ENEMIES AND THE END-OF-STAGE GUARDIAN CAN ONLY BE KILLED WITH HOMING MISSILES. AS THE PLAYER'S SHIP GETS CLOSE TO A METALLIC ENEMY, A "LOCK-ON" SQUARE WILL APPEAR OVER IT, FIRED HOMING MISSILES WILL THEN FOLLOW AND HIT THE ENEMY. 

UNLIKE THE PREQUEL, WHICH DISPLAYED THE YEAR IN WHICH EACH LEVEL WAS SET, THE TIME PERIODS OF 'TIME PILOT '84' ARE INDICATED BY NEW ENEMIES AND DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS.</desc>

RELEASING THE BUTTON MAKES THEIR POWER BALLS COME BACK TO THEM; THE ENEMIES ARE KILLED BY HAVING THE POWER BALLS SLAM INTO THEM.

KILLING ALL ENEMIES IN A MAZE ADVANCES THE PLAYER TO THE NEXT STAGE; HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT OF ONE ENEMY REMAINING, HE WILL MAKE FOR THE NEAREST CORNER OF THE MAZE, SAY "BYE-BYE!", AND DISAPPEAR - WHICH WILL DETRACT FROM THE "PURSUIT BONUS" THAT THE PLAYERS WILL RECEIVE AFTER THEY DEFEAT MAO AT THE END OF THE GAME.</desc>

TO AID HIM IN HIS MISSION, JOE IS EQUIPPED WITH A BIONIC ARM; A TELESCOPIC GRAPPLING HOOK THAT IS USED TO TRAVERSE THE MANY PLATFORMS AND LEDGES THAT MAKE UP THE GAME'S LEVELS. THE ARM CAN ALSO BE USED TO TEMPORARILY STUN ENEMIES OR KNOCK THEM FROM PLATFORMS, AS WELL AS TO RETRIEVE THE BONUS ITEMS, WOODEN CRATES AND WEAPONS THAT ARE OCCASIONALLY DROPPED INTO THE WAR ZONE BY PARACHUTE. 

AS WELL AS THE BIONIC ARM, JOE IS ARMED WITH A SHOTGUN USED TO KILL ENEMIES AND DESTROY OBSTRUCTIONS. THE SHOTGUN CAN ONLY BE FIRED LEFT AND RIGHT, HOWEVER, AND CANNOT BE USED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE BIONIC ARM. MORE POWERFUL GUNS CAN BE PICKED UP THROUGHOUT THE GAME.</desc>

		<desc>TRACK &amp; FIELD © 1983 KONAMI.

TRACK &amp; FIELD IS AN ATHLETICS-THEMED ACTION GAME FOR UP TO FOUR PLAYERS, WHO COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER IN SIX TRACK AND FIELD-BASED DISCIPLINES. 

THE GAME CONTROLS CONSIST OF TWO RUN BUTTONS (ONE FOR EACH 'LEG' OF THE ATHLETE) AND ONE 'ACTION' BUTTON. PLAYERS MUST HIT THE TWO RUN BUTTONS ALTERNATELY TO BUILD UP SPEED AND USE ACTION BUTTON TO JUMP OR THROW.

IN EACH EVENT, THERE IS A QUALIFYING TIME OR MINIMUM SCORE THRESHOLD THAT THE PLAYER MUST ACHIEVE TO ADVANCE TO THE NEXT EVENT. FAILING TO QUALIFY (IN ONE HEAT FOR TRACK EVENTS OR IN THREE ATTEMPTS IN THE OTHER EVENTS) WILL REDUCE THE PLAYERS' NUMBER OF LIVES BY ONE, THE GAME IS OVER ONCE ALL LIVES ARE LOST.

TRACK &amp; FIELD CAN ACCOMMODATE UP TO FOUR PLAYERS, WHO COMPETE IN PAIRS IN THE RUNNING EVENTS AND INDIVIDUALLY IN THE OTHERS. IF THERE ARE FEWER THAN FOUR PLAYERS, THE REMAINING SLOTS ARE PLAYED BY THE COMPUTER (OR PLAYER "CPU"). IN ALL MULTIPLAYER HEATS, HOWEVER, THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE PLAYERS HAS NO EFFECT ON THE GAME AND ADVANCING IS BASED SOLELY ON REACHING QUALIFYING TIMES AND TARGETS.

THE SIX EVENTS ARE:

100M DASH - RUN AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.
LONG JUMP - RUN TO THE TAKE-OFF BOARD THEN CHOOSE ANGLE OF JUMP (42 IS THE OPTIMUM ANGLE).
JAVELIN - RUN TO THE LINE THEN CHOOSE ANGLE OF THROW (43 IS THE OPTIMUM ANGLE).
110M HURDLES - RUN AND TIME JUMPS OVER THE HURDLES.
HAMMER THROW - AS THE ATHLETE SPINS FASTER AND FASTER, TIME RELEASE OF HAMMER AND ANGLE OF THROW (45 IS THE OPTIMUM ANGLE).
HIGH JUMP - THE ATHLETE WILL RUN TO THE BAR; JUST AS HE REACHES IT, USE ACTION BUTTON TO START THE JUMP AND HOLD DOWN THE ACTION BUTTON TO REDUCE THE ANGLE OF CLIMB, I.E. YOU START GOING STRAIGHT UP AT 90 DEGREES IF YOU TAP THE BUTTON JUST ONCE. USE RUN BUTTONS WHILE IN THE AIR TO GAIN EXTRA HEIGHT.</desc>

ONCE YOU HAVE FIRED A SHOT AT AN ANIMAL TO KNOCK HIM OUT, THE NUMBER 30 WILL APPEAR BELOW HIM AND START COUNTING DOWN - AND THIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL HAVE THIRTY SECONDS TO BRING THE ANIMAL OUT OF ANY OF THE MAZE'S SIX EXITS AS HIS TRUCK DRIVES AROUND AND HE PUTS HIM INSIDE, CAUSING THE NUMBER BELOW THAT TYPE OF ANIMAL'S HEAD UPON THE SIDE TO GO UP BY ONE. SNAKES ARE WORTH 200 POINTS, GORILLAS 300, LIONS 400, AND ELEPHANTS 500; YOU WILL ALSO RECEIVE A 10% BONUS AT THE END OF A ROUND IF YOU DID NOT WASTE ANY OF YOUR SHOTS.</desc>

		<desc>1 TO 4 PLAYERS TAKE ON THE ROLE OF A CUTE DINOSAUR, SELECTED FROM THE FOUR ON OFFER: REX (RED), BLOOP (BLUE), SPIKE (YELLOW) AND GWEN (LAVENDER). THE GAME TAKES PLACE IN A PREHISTORIC LAND CALLED 'OG' AND IS MADE UP OF FORTY-NINE DIFFERENT ISLANDS; THE DINOS MUST COLLECT ALL OF THE DINOSAUR EGGS THAT LAY ON THE ISLANDS, WHILE AVOIDING THE UNWANTED ATTENTION OF A TRIBE OF ONE-EYED CAVEMEN, CALLED 'TROGS'. THE DINOS CAN PUNCH THE ATTACKING TROGS; ONE PUNCH WILL ONLY STUN A TROG BUT SEVERAL PUNCHES WILL KNOCK THE ENEMY OFF THE SCREEN. THERE ARE 4 DIFFERENT TROGS WHO PURSUE THE DINOS:
BROWN TROGS WHO USE ONLY THEIR FISTS.
RED TROGS WHO USE CLUBS AND CREATE FIRES OR HOLES IN THE GROUND.
BLUE TROGS WHO POP UP OUT OF THE GROUND AND ROLL STONE WHEELS.
GREEN TROGS WHO BOUNCE AROUND TRYING TO CRUSH YOU WITH THEIR SPRINGS.
ON EACH ISLAND, AFTER THE DINOS HAVE GATHERED UP ALL OF THEIR EGGS, THEY MUST MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE BASE LABELED 'HOME'; FROM HERE THEY WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ISLAND.

BETWEEN EACH STAGE, THERE IS AN INTERMISSION WHERE THE PLAYERS' DINOS WILL DANCE, WITH AN ON-SCREEN CAPTION PROUDLY DECLARING 'EXCELLENT!', 'CONGRATULATIONS!', 'NICE WORK!', 'GOOD JOB!' OR 'DINO-MITE!'. ON OCCASION, AN INTERMISSION SCREEN APPEARS THAT SHOWS A TROG PLANNING ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO EAT A DINO.</desc>

		<name>Tron</name>
		<desc>TRON IS A 1- OR 2-PLAYER GAME SET INSIDE THE 'TRON' COMPUTER, AND IS BASED ON THE GROUND-BREAKING DISNEY MOVIE OF THE SAME NAME.

TRON CONSISTS OF TWENTY-TWO STAGES - OR 'PHASES' - OF PLAY. EACH PHASE CONSISTS OF FOUR SEPARATE GAMES CALLED "DOMAINS", ALL OF WHICH MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PHASE. PLAYERS CAN DETERMINE THE ORDER IN WHICH EACH OF THE FOUR DOMAINS IS ATTEMPTED, BUT THE DOMAIN POSITION IS RANDOM AND IS ONLY REVEALED ONCE THAT DOMAIN HAS BEEN CHOSEN.

THE FOUR DOMAINS THAT MAKE UP A PHASE NEVER CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE GAME, ALTHOUGH BOTH THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL AND NUMBER OF ENEMIES INCREASES WITH EACH SUBSEQUENT PHASE. THE DOMAINS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

LIGHT CYCLES: THE PLAYER CONTROLS A LIGHT CYCLE THAT LEAVES A BLUE LIGHT TRAIL IN ITS WAKE. THE AIM IS TO 'BOX IN' THE YELLOW ENEMY LIGHT CYCLES, MAKING THEM CRASH INTO EITHER A CYCLE TRAIL (THEIRS OR THE PLAYER'S) OR A WALL. THE PLAYER MUST ALSO AVOID ANY COLLISION WITH EITHER WALLS OR LIGHT TRAILS. THE JOYSTICK CONTROLS THE DIRECTION OF THE BIKE AND THE TRIGGER CONTROLS ITS SPEED.
I/O TOWER: DESTROY THE GRID BUGS THAT EMERGE FROM THE GRID SURROUNDING THE TOWER. THE BUGS WILL MULTIPLY AND FILL THE ENTIRE SCREEN IF NOT STOPPED. PLAYERS MUST ATTEMPT TO CLEAR A PATH TO - AND ENTER - THE I/O TOWER BEFORE THE TIMER RUNS OUT. THE STICK CONTROLS THE MOVEMENT OF THE PLAYER'S CHARACTER AND THE SPINNER CONTROLS THE DIRECTION OF FIRE.
TANK MAZE: DESTROY ALL ENEMY TANKS THAT ARE PATROLLING THE MAZE. THE PLAYER'S TANK CAN FIRE IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND CAN BOUNCE SHOTS OFF WALLS, BUT CAN BE DESTROYED BY A SINGLE SHOT; WHILE ENEMY TANKS CAN ONLY FIRE IN THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL BUT NEED THREE SHOTS BEFORE THEY ARE DESTROYED. "RECOGNIZER" TANKS ALSO FEATURE IN LATER PHASES; THESE DO NOT SHOOT BUT MOVE QUICKLY AND WILL TRY TO RAM THE PLAYER'S TANK. THE JOYSTICK CONTROLS THE MOVEMENT OF THE PLAYER'S TANK AND THE SPINNER CONTROLS THE DIRECTION OF FIRE.
MCP CONE: DESTROY THE BLOCKS IN THE DESCENDING, ROTATING COLOURED COLUMN TO CLEAR A PATH AND MOVE THE CHARACTER UP INTO THE LIGHT CONE ABOVE THE BLOCKS. A BONUS IS AWARDED IF ALL OF THE BLOCKS ARE DESTROYED. THE STICK CONTROLS THE MOVEMENT OF THE CHARACTER AND THE SPINNER CONTROLS THE DIRECTION OF FIRE.

BONUS LIVES ARE AWARDED PERIODICALLY THROUGHOUT THE GAME AS SPECIFIC POINT SCORES ARE REACHED. EACH ENEMY AND ITEM HAS AN ASSIGNED POINT VALUE (SEE THE "SCORING" SECTION FOR DETAILS).</desc>

THE ACCELERATION BUTTON NEEDS TO BE HELD DOWN ALL THE TIME WHILE THE 'TRICK' BUTTON MAKES THE WATER-SKIING GIRL SPIN THROUGH ONE-EIGHTY DEGREES AND PROCEED TO SKI BACKWARDS. THE PLAYER CANNOT STEER WHILE TRAVELING BACKWARDS, BUT WILL EARN BONUS POINTS FOR THE DURATION OF THE TRICK. AS THE GAME PROGRESSES, SMALL RAMPS, BUOYS AND SHARKS COME INTO PLAY. THE SMALL RAMPS CAN BE JUMPED TO ADD TO THE PLAYER'S SCORE, ALTHOUGH THEY'RE ALWAYS IN DIFFICULT TO REACH LOCATIONS. THE BUOYS ARE USUALLY VERY CLOSE TOGETHER, BUT SKIING BETWEEN THEM EARNS BONUS POINTS. FINALLY, THE SHARK WILL APPEAR FROM TIME-TO-TIME, RUNNING INTO IT MEANS GAME OVER, REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH TIME THE PLAYER HAS LEFT.</desc>

		<desc>EACH LEVEL CONTAINS EXACTLY 28 BUOYS. LOGS ARE PLACED AT RANDOM AND WILL BE RE-ARRANGED UPON LOSING A SHIP ON THE SAME LEVEL. OF THE EIGHT STAGES, THE FIRST FOUR ARE WITH A NICE, WIDE RIVER CHANNEL. EACH OF THESE FOUR STAGES INCREASES IN SPEED AND THE NUMBER OF LOGS ON IT. STAGES FIVE TO EIGHT HAVE A MUCH NARROWER RIVER AND INCREASE IN SPEED ON EACH STAGE.

LEVEL EIGHT IS BELIEVED TO BE UNBEATABLE GIVEN THE COMPLEX ARRANGEMENT OF DENSELY CLUSTERED LOGS ON A NARROW RIVER. THE BEST STRATEGY IS TO PASS EACH OF THE 7 STAGES FIRST WITHOUT LOSING ANY SHIPS AND COLLECTING AS MANY BUOYS AS POSSIBLE. THEN, ON STAGE 8, COLLECT AS MANY BUOYS AS POSSIBLE UNTIL YOU CRASH. ONCE YOU CRASH, THE STAGE WILL RE-START AND REARRANGE THE LOGS (GIVING THE PLAYER A CHANCE TO RE-NEGOTIATE THE TIGHT RIVER).

HOLDING DOWN THE FIRE BUTTON SUCKS THE ENEMIES INTO THE CLEANER, RELEASING THE BUTTON CAUSES THEM TO BE EXPELLED BACK OUT.

THROUGHOUT THE GAME, LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET RANDOMLY APPEAR IN BUBBLES. THESE CAN BE COLLECTED TO EVENTUALLY SPELL THE WORD "TUMBLEPOP". ONCE THIS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED PLAYERS ARE TRANSPORTED TO A TIME-LIMITED BONUS LEVEL, GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN BONUS POINTS AND EXTRA LIVES.</desc>

TWINBEE IS SELECTABLE, ALONG WITH A CHARGE PUNCH, A CHARGE SPLIT (WHICH WILL CAUSE THE PLAYER'S SHIP TO SHOOT DUPLICATES OF ITSELF), AND A CHARGE EXPLOSION THAT FIRES AT EIGHT DIRECTIONS AT THE SAME TIME. THE PLAYER WILL THEN CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO CONTROL STYLES: ONE WHICH FIRES THE GUN WITH ONE BUTTON AND DROPS BOMBS WITH THE SECOND, WHILE THE OTHER STYLE SHOOTS AND DROPS BOMB AT THE SAME TIME WITH A SINGLE BUTTON (EITHER BUTTON CAN BE USED).

LIKE IN PREVIOUS TWIN BEE GAMES, THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF POWER-UPS: BELL POWER-UPS OBTAINED FROM THE SKY AND LAND POWER-UPS THAT CAN BE RETRIEVED FROM DESTROY GROUND ENEMIES. THE BELLS CAN BE CHANGED TO UP TO SIX COLORS THIS TIME (YELLOW, BLUE, WHITE, GREEN, RED, AND PINK), EACH WITH A UNIQUE ATTRIBUTE. GWINBEE RETURNS AS WELL AS A POWER-UP ITEM, ALONG WITH THE TWIN ATTACKS THAT CAN BE PERFORMED WITH GWINBEE OR ANOTHER PLAYER.</desc>

THE OBJECT OF THE GAME, WHICH IS NOT EXPLAINED FURTHER, IS TO AVENGE JOE'S BROTHER - WHICH IS PROBABLY NOT ASSUMED TO BE THE PLAYER, BUT PRESUMABLY A FRIEND OF THE PLAYER WHO LOST HIS BROTHER TO THE ENEMY. (IT USES BAD ENGLISH GRAMMAR ON THE SUBTITLE OF THE SCREEN, USING "REVENGE" AS A VERB, AS APPOSED TO "AVENGE".  THAT BEING SAID, IT'S A PRETTY TIGHT GAME OTHERWISE.)  TO DO SO, YOU MUST DESTROY THE FORTRESS ON THE VERY LAST LEVEL. WHEN YOU START THE GAME AND IT SCROLLS ONTO THE STARTING SCREEN, THE BACKGROUND CONTAINS THE DIFFERENT LEVELS THAT YOU MUST SURVIVE. THE STARTING POSITION OF THE VARIOUS ENEMIES DOES NOT VARY FROM GAME TO GAME.</desc>

		<desc>TWIN EAGLE II IS A VERTICAL SCROLLING SHOOTER WHERE ONE OR TWO PLAYERS PILOT HEAVILY ARMED HELICOPTERS THROUGH THREE STAGES WITH THREE AREAS EACH.

AT THE START OF EACH STAGE, THE PLAYERS SELECT THEIR PATH OF ATTACK THROUGH THE THREE AREAS.  AREAS WITH GROUND LEVEL ENEMIES AND TARGETS ARE PRESENTED IN A 3/4 ISOMETRIC VIEW, WHILE AREAS WITH NO GROUND TARGETS FEATURE SCROLLING LANDSCAPE IMAGES.  PLAYERS USE THEIR GUNS TO ATTACK FLYING ENEMY AIRCRAFT AND BOMBS TO ATTACK GROUND TARGETS SUCH AS TANKS, ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND HIGH-RISE SKYSCRAPERS.  IF THINGS GET TOO HAIRY, THE PLAYER CAN USE A MISSILE BARRAGE TO CLEAR THE SCREEN OF ENEMIES AND ENEMY FIREPOWER.  DESTROYING SOME BUILDINGS REVEAL PRIMARY COLORED TRUCKS WHICH DROP WEAPON POWER-UPS AND POINT ITEMS WHEN DESTROYED.  EACH AREA FEATURES A BOSS AT THE END, WHICH MUST BE DESTROYED TO ADVANCE PAST THE AREA.  THE FINAL STAGE FEATURES ONE ADDITIONAL BOSS BEFORE THE END OF THE GAME.</desc>

YOU THEN WILL GO TO THE NEXT SCREEN WHICH HAS YOUR FIGHTER/BOMBER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN. A GUNSIGHT WILL ALSO BE SOMEWHERE IN THE SKY (THE GUNSIGHT IS ACTUALLY THE SPOT WHERE ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE WILL BE HITTING AT). SOON THE SKY IS FILLED WITH ENEMY PLANES AND A SHIP ENTERS THE SCREEN FROM THE LEFT SIDE. YOU MISSION WILL BE TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO PUT THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF HOLES INTO THE ENEMY SHIP TO SINK IT. YOU HAVE AT YOUR DISPOSAL A SINGLE BOMB AND THE ENEMY PLANES THEMSELVES FOR ACHIEVING YOUR GOAL. ALONG THE WAY, OTHER THINGS MAY ASSIST (IF YOU SHOOT THEM) SUCH AS MINES AND FUEL DRUMS. THE GAME WILL GO UNTIL YOU FAIL TO SINK 2 SHIPS. IF YOU ARE IN 2-PLAYER COOPERATIVE MODE, THEN THE NUMBER OF HOLES TO SINK A SHIP WILL BE INCREASED. THE SAME RULES APPLY, THOUGH, FOR SENDING IT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.</desc>

IN SINGLE-PLAYER MODE, ONE PERSON CONTROLS BOTH CHARACTERS ON A TEAM. IN TWO-PLAYER MODE, THE PLAYERS EITHER COOPERATE BY PLAYING ON THE SAME TEAM OR COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER BY CONTROLLING OPPOSING TEAMS. THE AMERICAN VERSION ALLOWS THE GAME TO BE PLAYED BY UP TO FOUR PLAYERS (IF THE CABINET ALLOWS IT). THE SINGLE-PLAYER MODE CONSISTS OF TWO CYCLES WITH FOUR STAGES: THE MINOR CIRCUIT AND THE MAJOR CIRCUIT. THE STAGES IN THE GAME ARE DAYTONA BEACH, NEW YORK, LOS ANGELES AND HAWAII. AFTER COMPLETING THE MAJOR CIRCUIT, THE PLAYER FACES AGAINST THE U.S. NAVY TEAM, SET IN A NAVAL BASE.

THE CONTROLS CONSIST OF AN EIGHT DIRECTIONAL JOYSTICK AND TWO BUTTONS FOR JUMPING AND RECEIVING. THE CHARACTERS PERFORM SEVERAL MOVES INCLUDING POWER SPIKING, BACK SPIKING, JUMP-SERVING, BLOCKING AND DIVING.

THERE ARE A FEW MINOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE JAPANESE AND AMERICAN RELEASES. THE JAPANESE RELEASE FEATURES AN OPENING CUT-SCENE EXPLAINING THE PLOT. BETWEEN MATCHES, INTERMISSION SEQUENCES DEPICT THE MAIN CHARACTERS VISITING A CAR DEALERSHIP TO PURCHASE A VEHICLE. AS THE PLAYER PROGRESSES, THE CARS INCREASE IN QUALITY, SHIFTING FROM USED CARS TO NEW CARS DURING THE MAJOR CIRCUIT. THE AMERICAN RELEASE REMOVES THESE CUT-SCENES, BUT EXTENDS THE MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT TO UP TO FOUR PLAYERS WITH MULTIPLE GAME MODES: 1 OR 2 PLAYERS AGAINST THE COMPUTER, 1-ON-1, 2-ON-1, OR 2-ON-2.</desc>

NO ENTANTO, EM 1997, USANDO NOVAS ARMAS PROJETADAS EM SEGREDO, UM PAÍS DO ORIENTE MÉDIO CHAMADO RABU AMEAÇOU DESTRUIR ESTA FRÁGIL PAZ. O OBJETIVO DE RABU, JUNTO COM SEUS ALIADOS, É EXPURGAR O MUNDO DO PECADO E FORÇAR UMA NOVA MORALIDADE. RABU RAPIDAMENTE REIVINDICOU O ORIENTE MÉDIO, ENTÃO ESPALHOU-SE TANTO NO SUL DA ÁSIA E PARTES DA EUROPA. SEU ARMAMENTO É TERRIVELMENTE EFICIENTE NA MANUFATURA DA MORTE. ELES PARECIAM IMPARÁVEIS. QUANDO ELES INTOXICARAM TÓQUIO COM GÁS EM 1999, A INTERVENÇÃO DOS EUA TORNOU-SE INEVITÁVEL. SE RABU CONSEGUIR UTILIZAR AS FÁBRICAS DO JAPÃO, NÃO HAVERÁ FIM PARA O PESADELO.

		<desc>VENTURE IS A 1- OR 2-PLAYER "GAUNTLET" STYLE GAME (ALTHOUGH VENTURE PRE-DATES THE ATARI LEGEND BY 4 YEARS) SET IN A MULTI-LEVEL DUNGEON. THE PLAYER, ARMED WITH A BOW AND ARROW FIGHTS THROUGH ENEMY INFESTED LEVELS IN THE QUEST TO COLLECT TREASURE.

EACH DUNGEON IS REPRESENTED AS A FLOOR PLAN, POPULATED WITH A NUMBER OF "SPACE INVADER" LIKE MONSTERS. NUMEROUS ROOMS AND THEIR CORRESPONDING DOORS ARE CLEARLY MARKED; THESE ROOMS ARE THE TREASURE ROOMS AND EACH ONE MUST BE CLEARED. WHEN THE PLAYER ENTERS A ROOM, THE VIEWPOINT ZOOMS IN ON THE ACTION AND THE ROOM TAKES UP THE WHOLE SCREEN. EACH ROOM HAS A TREASURE OR WEAPON GUARDED BY ONE OR MORE CREATURES. PLAYERS MUST TRY TO RETRIEVE THE TREASURE WHILE AVOIDING (OR KILLING) CREATURES AND OBSTACLES. ONLY IN THE ROOMS THEMSELVES CAN PLAYERS USE THEIR BOW AND ARROW.

WHEN THE TREASURE IS SUCCESSFULLY TAKEN OUT OF THE CHAMBER, BONUS POINTS ARE AWARDED. THE SCREEN IMAGE THEN RETURNS TO THE ORIGINAL, ZOOMED-OUT FLOOR PLAN AND THE PLAYER MOVES ON TO THE NEXT ROOM OF THEIR CHOICE. ONCE A ROOM HAS BEEN CLEARED OF ITS ITEM, THE PLAYER NO LONGER HAS ACCESS TO THAT ROOM. THE PLAYER MUST COLLECT ALL OF THE TREASURES ON THE CURRENT LEVEL BEFORE DESCENDING TO ANOTHER DUNGEON.</desc>

AS TEAM COMMANDER OF THE SR-88 STRATEGIC BATTLE TANKS, YOU MUST FACE THE EVIL INVADING FORCES OF THE TANGENT EMPIRE. THEY'RE INVADING THE GALAXY WITH 14 SPACE STATIONS DESIGNED TO DEFEAT YOUR TEAM. TURRETS AND HIGHLY MOBILE ARMOURED TANKS ARE CONSTANTLY ON PATROL TO PROTECT THE FORTIFICATIONS THAT TANGENTS HAVE BUILT.

WITH LIMITED SUPPLIES AND WEAPONS, YOU MUST MAKE A LAST STAND AND ATTEMPT TO DEFEAT THE INVADERS. THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON IN YOUR ARSENAL IS THE SR-88 BATTLE TANK, BUT THEIR FUEL SUPPLY IS VERY VOLATILE. YOU MUST CONSTANTLY REPLENISH ITS FUEL BY PICKING UP FUEL CANISTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATIONS' MANY LEVELS.

BATTLE STARS CAN BE FOUND ALONG THE WAY. THESE ARE VITAL TO ENHANCING YOUR TANK AND ADDING WEAPONS. PROCESS GENERATORS CAN CONVERT THE BATTLE STARS INTO POWERS AND WEAPONS WHILE IN TRANSIT BETWEEN LEVELS AND STATIONS. ONLY WITH THESE CUSTOMIZED TANKS CAN THE EVIL TANGENT EMPIRE BE CONQUERED.

AS YOU DEFEAT EACH STATION, DEMOLISH ITS CONTROL ROOM AND TAKE THE SUPPLIES THE FLEEING TANGENTS HAVE LEFT BEHIND. PROCEED IN THEIR MOTHERSHIP TO THE NEXT STATION FOR ANOTHER BATTLE.</desc>

		<desc>VIOLENT STORM IS A SIDEWAYS-SCROLLING BEAT-EM-UP FOR UP TO THREE PLAYERS SET IN THE AFTERMATH OF WORLD WAR III. THE SURVIVORS OF THE WAR ARE ATTEMPTING TO REBUILD THEIR WORLD BUT ARE BEING TERRORISED BY VIOLENT GANGS . THREE VIGILANTE HEROES CALLED 'BORIS', 'WADE' AND 'KYLE' ARE TRYING TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS BUT ARE HAMPERED IN THEIR EFFORTS BY THE EVIL AND CORRUPT 'GELD' GANG. AS THE HEROES ARE PATROLLING THE STREETS, THEY SEE THEIR FRIEND, SHEENA, KIDNAPPED BY THE GANG. THE VIGILANTES MUST FIGHT THROUGH SEVEN ENEMY-PACKED STAGES TO RESCUE THEIR FRIEND AND DESTROY THE GANG.

AS WELL AS THE STANDARD PUNCH AND KICK MOVES, EACH CHARACTER ALSO HAS A SPECIAL ATTACK. THIS MOVE IS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO FELL SEVERAL ENEMIES AT ONCE, BUT WITH THE TRADE-OFF THAT EACH TIME A SPECIAL ATTACK IS EXECUTED, SOME OF THE PLAYER'S HEALTH IS LOST. HEALTH LEVELS CAN BE REPLENISHED BY FINDING THE FOOD THAT LIES HIDDEN IN BREAKABLE CRATES AND BARRELS. 

SOME OF THE GANG MEMBERS WILL DROP A WEAPON WHEN THEY ARE FELLED. THESE WEAPONS CAN THEN BE PICKED UP AND USED BY THE PLAYERS. DESTRUCTIBLE CRATES AND BARRELS ALSO CONTAIN WEAPONS AND RANDOM BONUS ITEMS. STUNNED ENEMIES FALL TO THE GROUND AND CAN STILL BE ATTACKED WHILE PRONE.</desc>

		<desc>A PLATFORM GAME BASED ON THE 1985 STEVEN SPIELBERG MOVIE OF THE SAME NAME. THE PLAYER TAKES CONTROL OF MIKEY AND MUST EXPLORE A VARIETY OF CAVERNS AND ROOMS, SEARCHING FOR THE THREE KEYS NEEDED TO UNLOCK THE HUGE, METAL DOOR THAT BARS PROGRESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL. THE KEYS ARE HIDDEN BEHIND A NUMBER OF DOORS WHICH CAN ONLY BE REMOVED BY PLACING A BOMB IN FRONT OF THEM AND BLOWING THEM OPEN. MIKEY'S PROGRESS IS HAMPERED BY THE MANY ENEMIES THAT ROAM THE LEVELS. THE BOMBS NEEDED TO BLOW THE DOORS APPEAR WHEN CERTAIN ENEMIES ARE KILLED.

A FELLOW 'GOONIE' IS TRAPPED BEHIND ONE OF THE DOORS ON EACH LEVEL, AND CAN BE RESCUED, ALTHOUGH THIS ISN'T NECESSARY TO PROGRESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL. A CATAPULT, OR 'SLINGSHOT', CAN ALSO BE FOUND, ALLOWING MIKEY TO ATTACK ENEMIES FROM A SAFE DISTANCE.</desc>

YOU ONLY HAVE TWO WEAPONS, YOUR BLASTER, AND A LIMITED SUPPLY OF BOMBS. THIS TITLE USES THE TIME HONORED TOP-DOWN VERTICALLY SCROLLING FORMAT. THE BACKGROUND MOVES ETERNALLY FORWARD, BUT YOU CAN MOVE ALL AROUND THE SCREEN, AND CAN MAKE THE SCREEN SCROLL BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT. YOUR ENEMIES CONSIST OF AN ASSORTMENT OF FAIRLY REALISTIC LOOKING SPACECRAFT, SOME OF WHICH HAVE A DISTINCTIVE 'INSECTOID' LOOK TO THEM. THIS GAME IS ENDLESS AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE A LEVEL FORMAT. YOU JUST MOVE FORWARD AND SHOOT. THE BACKGROUNDS WILL CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME FROM PLANETARY SURFACES TO SPACE SCENES AND EVENTUALLY THEY WILL START REPEATING ONCE YOU BLAST THIS PARTICULARLY LARGE ALIEN FORMATION.</desc>

		<desc>ATARI'S WARLORDS DEPICTS A THIRD-PERSON VIEW OF FOUR CASTLES. THE PLAYER-CONTROLLED WARLORDS AND COMPUTER-CONTROLLED BLACK KNIGHTS USE SHIELDS TO DEFEND THEIR CASTLE WALLS FROM THE FIREBALLS THAT RICOCHET AROUND THE PLAYFIELD. 

PLAYERS CAN CAPTURE AND CATAPULT THE FIREBALLS AT OPPOSING CASTLES, USING THEIR SHIELD CONTROL AND 'POWER STONE' PUSHBUTTON. WHEN A FIREBALL HITS A CASTLE WALL, IT DESTROYS ONE OR MORE BRICKS, DEPENDING ON ITS SPEED. 

A CASTLE NOT PAID FOR IS CONTROLLED BY THE COMPUTER, WITH A BLACK KNIGHT DISPLAYED IN THE APPROPRIATE CASTLE. THE BLACK KNIGHTS CATAPULT FIREBALLS AT THE PLAYERS WITH INCREASING ACCURACY, TO PROVIDE CHALLENGE. 

GAME PLAY BEGINS WHEN ANY START BUTTON IS PRESSED AND THE COUNTDOWN HAS ENDED. THE GAME ENDS WHEN THE LAST WARLORD'S CASTLE (CONTAINING A CROWN) HAS BEEN PENETRATED BY A FIREBALL. AT THIS POINT A WHITE CLOUD ENVELOPES THE CROWN, AND THE LATTER DISAPPEARS. 

DURING THE COUNTDOWN, A DRAGON FLIES BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE SCREEN WITH A FIREBALL IN ITS MOUTH. AT THE END OF THE COUNTDOWN, A POSITION ACTIVATED BY A START BUTTON HAS ITS BLACK KNIGHT CHANGED TO A WARLORD'S CROWN. A POSITION NOT ACTIVATED REMAINS AS A BLACK KNIGHT AND IS CONTROLLED BY THE COMPUTER. THE DRAGON THEN SPITS THE FIREBALL FROM ITS MOUTH TOWARD A WARLORD'S CASTLE. 

THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DESTROY THE THREE OTHER CASTLES, WHILE PROTECTING ONE'S OWN CASTLE WITH THE MOVING SHIELD. THE LED PUSHBUTTONS HAVE DUAL FUNCTIONS: IN THE READY-TO-PLAY MODE THEY WORK AS START SWITCHES, AND DURING GAME PLAY THEY BECOME 'POWER STONES' TO ALLOW PLAYERS TO CAPTURE AND CATAPULT FIREBALLS AT OPPONENTS.</desc>

THE PLAYER MAY CHOOSE WHEN TO WARP TO A DIFFERENT WORLD, SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONTINUE PLAYING IN THE SAME WORLD THROUGHOUT THE GAME. IN SPACE WORLD, THE CHARACTER USES A GUN TO SHOOT UP ENEMY ALIENS, AND IN MAZE WORLD, ALIENS ARE KILLED USING A TIME-DELAY BOMB. THE DELAY IS CONTROLLED BY THE LENGTH OF TIME THE BUTTON IS HELD DOWN, AND THE PLAYER LOSES IF THE CHARACTER IS CAUGHT IN THE RESULTING EXPLOSION.

POWER-UPS MAY APPEAR ON SOME LEVELS, AND ALLOW THE PLAYER TO SHOOT EXPLODING BULLETS OR ATTACH BOMBS DIRECTLY ONTO ENEMY ALIENS. HOWEVER, THE EXPLODING BULLETS USABLE IN SPACE WORLD CAN ONLY OBTAINED IN MAZE WORLD, AND THE POWER-UP TO ATTACH BOMBS ONTO ENEMIES IN MAZE WORLD ONLY APPEARS IN SPACE WORLD. PLAYERS MUST ALTERNATE TURNS ON THE SCREEN IN THE MULTIPLAYER MODE.</desc>

THE PLAYER'S SHIP HAS A DETACHABLE ORB ATTACHMENT CALLED THE FLINT, WHICH BEHAVES IN A SIMILAR FASHION TO THE 'FORCE DEVICE' FROM IREM'S "R-TYPE" SERIES. POWER-UPS CAN BE OBTAINED TO INCREASE THE FLINT'S POWER, MOVEMENT SPEED, CHANGE THE MAIN WEAPON, OR EVEN GIVE THE PLAYER AN EXTRA LIFE.

THE PLAYER STARTS THE GAME ARMED WITH THE PROTON LASER, WHICH EMITS THIN STREAM OF WEAK BULLETS. DEFEATING CERTAIN ENEMIES WILL DROP OTHER WEAPONS:
HOMING LASER: A 3-WAY LASER WITH WEAK "BENDING" HOMING FOR TOP AND BOTTOM LASERS.
SHADOW LASER: A LASER BEAM THAT CREATES A DAMAGE-INFLICTING SHADOW AS THE SHIP MOVES UP AND DOWN. 
ROUND LASER: AN UNUSUAL SPREAD SHOT (DIFFERENT FROM THE OVERSEAS VERSION'S MAIN WEAPON)
SPIRAL LASER: A SPIRAL LASER OF CONSIDERABLE WIDTH.
SEARCH LASER: A LASER WITH STRONG HOMING THAT TRAVELS IN SQUARE TRAJECTORIES.
GROUND LASER: FIRES AN UPGRADED PROTON LASER ALONG WITH A LASER BEAM THAT TRAVELS ALONG THE GROUND.

THE NAME OF THE CURRENT WEAPON IS DISPLAYED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. IN THE NON-JAPANESE OVERSEAS VERSIONS, THE ONLY AVAILABLE WEAPON IS THE PROTON LASER AND PICKING UP POWER-UPS SIMPLY INCREASES THE SPREAD OF THE WEAPON. MISSILES ARE A SECONDARY WEAPON.</desc>

EACH X-MAN CHARACTER HAS AN 'ATTACK', 'JUMP' AND 'MUTANT POWER' BUTTON. THE MUTANT POWER ATTACK IS A POWERFUL SPECIAL MOVE UNIQUE TO EACH X-MAN. WHILE IT INFLICTS A LOT OF DAMAGE ON THE ENEMIES, THE TRADE-OFF IS THAT EACH USAGE REMOVES 3 BARS FROM THE PLAYERS HEALTH METER (A FULL METER HAS 10 BARS). EACH LEVEL ENDS WITH A FACE-OFF AGAINST A POWERFUL MUTANT BOSS CHARACTER.

THE GAME HAS SIX STAGES, WITH THE FINAL ONE SET ON 'ASTEROID M', MAGNETO'S BASE. THE DEFEATED MUTANT BOSSES FROM THE PREVIOUS LEVELS EACH MAKE AN APPEARANCE (ALBEIT IN A LESS POWERFUL FORM) BEFORE THE FINAL ENCOUNTER WITH MAGNETO HIMSELF.

		<desc>XYBOTS IS A 3-DIMENSIONAL, 3RD-PERSON PERSPECTIVE SHOOT-EM-UP FOR 1 OR 2 PLAYERS. TAKING ON THE ROLE OF EITHER 'MAJOR ROCK HARDY' OR 'CAPTAIN ACE GUNN' (IN THE 2-PLAYER GAME), PLAYERS MUST SHOOT THEIR WAY THROUGH A HUGE, MULTI-LEVEL UNDERGROUND CITY - MADE UP OF A SERIES OF MAZES - AND DESTROY THE EVIL 'XYBOT' ROBOT WARRIORS THAT HAVE INVADED THE PLANET AND ESTABLISHED THEIR UNDERGROUND FORTRESS. THE PLAYERS' ON-SCREEN COUNTERPARTS WALK 'INTO' THE SCREEN AND PLAYERS MUST MANUALLY ROTATE THE MAZE'S VIEWPOINT LEFT AND RIGHT WHEN CHANGING DIRECTION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO LOOK IN THE DIRECTION THEY ARE MOVING. 

EACH LEVEL HAS AT LEAST ONE EXIT THAT MUST BE REACHED IN ORDER TO PROGRESS TO THE NEXT (SOME LEVELS HAVE EXTRA HIDDEN EXITS THAT 'WARP' PLAYERS TO LATER LEVELS). PLAYERS CAN FIND ENERGY PODS TO RESTORE ENERGY LEVELS, KEYS TO OPEN DOORS, AND GOLDEN COINS. SOME OF THE LEVELS ALSO FEATURE TRANSPORTERS THAT CONNECT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SAME LEVEL.

AT THE END OF EACH LEVEL, PLAYERS CAN ENTER A SHOP WHERE SUPPLIES AND POWER-UPS CAN BE PURCHASED WITH ANY COINS THEY HAVE COLLECTED. SOME SUPPLIES, SUCH AS 'SHIELD' OR 'SPEED' ARE PERMANENT, WHEREAS OTHERS ARE ONLY TEMPORARY AND MUST BE REPLENISHED.

A MAP OF EACH LEVEL IS DISPLAYED AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. FOR SOME LEVELS, ALL ENEMIES, OBJECTS AND WALLS ARE SHOWN. ON LATER LEVELS, HOWEVER, THE MAP MAY ONLY DISPLAY THE ENEMY ROBOTS AND/OR OBJECTS; WITH THE MAZE WALLS AND LAYOUT ONLY BECOMING VISIBLE ONCE A PLAYER HAS 'LOOKED' AT A WALL SECTION. XYBOTS' GAMEPLAY FEELS HIGHLY REMINISCENT OF A 3-DIMENSIONAL "GAUNTLET" (WITH GOOD REASON, SEE TRIVIA FOR MORE DETAILS). THE GAME ALSO USES A SPLIT-SCREEN DISPLAY TO ALLOW FOR TWO-PLAYER SIMULTANEOUS PLAY; SOMETHING OF AN INNOVATION FOR 1987.

LIKE THE "GAUNTLET" GAMES ON WHICH XYBOTS IS BASED; THE GAME IS ENDLESS AND PLAY WILL CONTINUE UNTIL ALL LIVES ARE LOST AND PLAYERS NO LONGER WISH TO USE THE 'CONTINUE' OPTION.</desc>

		<desc>YIE AR KUNG-FU IS A SINGLE-PLAYER ONE-ON-ONE FIGHTING GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYER TAKES ON THE ROLE OF 'OOLONG' WHO MUST FIGHT AND DEFEAT ELEVEN MARTIAL ARTS MASTERS. HIS ULIMATE GOAL IS TO WIN THE TITLE OF "GRAND MASTER" AND HONOUR THE MEMORY OF HIS FATHER, WHO WAS KILLED WHILE FIGHTING THE CURRENT GRAND MASTER.

THE PLAYER FACES A VARIETY OF OPPONENTS, EACH WITH A UNIQUE APPEARANCE AND FIGHTING STYLE. SOME OPPONENTS ARE ALSO ARMED, WITH WEAPONS INCLUDING NUNCHAKU, THROWING STARS AND A CLUB. THE PLAYER CAN PERFORM UP TO 16 DIFFERENT MOVES USING A COMBINATION OF BUTTONS AND JOYSTICK MOVEMENTS WHILE STANDING, CROUCHING OR JUMPING. MOVES ARE THROWN AT HIGH, MIDDLE, AND LOW LEVELS. 

YIE AR KUNG-FU PLAYS INCREDIBLY QUICKLY, WITH THE PLAYER HAVING TO BE CONSTANTLY ON THE MOVE TO AVOID GETTING 'PEGGED IN' BY SOME OF THE GAME'S TOUGHER OPPONENTS. THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT IN WHICH THE OPPONENT MUST BE DEFEATED BUT OOLONG POSSESSES A FINITE AMOUNT OF HEALTH, REPRESENTED BY A HEALTH BAR AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. ONCE OOLONG'S HEALTH IS FULLY DEPLETED, THE MATCH IS OVER.</desc>

		<desc>IN YOSAKU TO DONBEI YOU PLAY A LITTLE FARMER GUY, WHO IS ATTEMPTING TO SHOOT DOWN THE CROWS OUT OF HIS TREE. GAMEPLAY IS IDENTICAL TO THAT OF "SPACE INVADERS". A LARGE BIRD REPLACES THE UFO THAT GOES OVER THE TOP OF THE SCREEN FROM TIME TO TIME. WHILE A LUMBERJACK WILL CHOP OUT A SECTION OF THE TREE EVERY TIME THE BIRDS REACH THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN (LOWERING THEM CLOSER TO THE BOTTOM). THE ONLY REAL GAMEPLAY DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE BIRDS COME IN A PYRAMID PATTERN, AS OPPOSED TO THE RECTANGLE PATTERN OF "SPACE INVADERS". THIS SERVES TO MAKE THE GAME MUCH EASIER.</desc>

		<desc>ZEKTOR IS A ONE- OR TWO-PLAYER GAME THAT TASKS YOU WITH THE LIBERATION OF EIGHT CITIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEIZED BY THE EVIL CADRE OF ALIEN ROBOTS. IN ORDER TO LIBERATE A CITY, YOU MUST DEFEAT THREE ATTACK WAVES OF FIGHTERS AND ROBO-PROBES. FIGHTERS AND ROBO-PROBES ARE OFTEN SHIELDED (IN RED), AND EACH CONSECUTIVE HIT REDUCES THE ENEMIES SHIELD STRENGTH, UNTIL, WHEN THE SHIELD DROPS, A HIT WILL DESTROY IT. IN ADDITION, YOU WILL ENCOUNTER THREE TYPES OF MOBOIDS:
GREEN MOBOIDS SPIN THE PLAYERS SHIP ON CONTACT, AND BOUNCE ENEMY SHIPS.
BLUE MOBOIDS BOUNCE ALL SHIPS.
RED MOBOIDS DESTROY ALL UN-SHIELDED SHIPS (INCLUDING THE PLAYERS SHIP).

AFTER DEFEATING THREE ATTACK WAVES, THE ALIEN ROBOT HOLDING THAT CITY WILL REAPPEAR WITHIN ROTATING PROTECTIVE RINGS, THROUGH WHICH A 'SLOT SHOT' NEUTRALIZES THAT ROBOT, AWARDING THE PLAYER A BONUS SHIP AND ADVANCEMENT TO THE NEXT ROUND.</desc>

		<desc>THE TITLE OF THE GAME IS MOSTLY SELF-EXPLANATORY, AS IT IS WRESTLING GAME WITH AN ALL-JAPANESE CAST OF FIGHTERS. THE GAME IS LICENSED TITLE, BASED ON THE REAL "ALL JAPAN PRO WRESTLING" (ZEN NIHON PURORESU) WRESTLING PROMOTION. THE "FEATURING VIRTUA"-PART OF THE TITLE IS RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WOLF AND JEFFREY FROM THE GAME VIRTUA FIGHTER AS PLAYABLE CHARACTERS.

LIKE VIRTUA FIGHTER, THE GRAPHICS OF THE GAME ARE FULLY IN 3D. THE ACTION IS SHOWN FROM CHANGING PERSPECTIVES. THERE IS A LARGE VARIETY OF MOVES AVAILABLE; APART FROM BASIC LIKE ATTACK OR HOLD (WHICH CAN ALSO BE MODIFIED WITH THE D-PAD) THERE ARE ALSO TAUNTS AND COUNTER MOVES AVAILABLE, FOR EXAMPLE. FURTHERMORE, THE GAME FEATURES A INJURY SYSTEM: WHEN A HIGH AMOUNT OF DAMAGE IS INFLICTED, THE GAME PAUSES SHORTLY TO SHOW AN X-RAY PICTURE AND THE INCREASED DAMAGE OF THE CORRESPONDING SECTION OF THE BODY.

APART FROM SINGLE PLAYER MODE, THE GAME ALSO FEATURES A MULTIPLAYER AND A TRAINING MODE.</desc>

LOLA -- WHOSE AFFECTION IS NOT EASILY CAPTURED. ZZYZZYXX'S VULNERABILITY INCREASES (AS HE COLLECTS GIFTS, AS WELL AS POINTS) NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF LOLA'S UNTOUCHABLE ATTITUDE, BUT BECAUSE OF OBSTACLES SUCH AS RATTIFERS TRYING TO PUT AN END TO ZZYZZYXX'S QUEST FOR LOLA'S LOVE AND AFFECTION.

INTELLIGENT AS THE RATTIFERS MAY BE, THERE ARE 2 DEFENSES ZZYZZYXX CAN USE TO OUTSMART THE DESTRUCTIVE CREATURES. ZZYZZYXX CAN BRICK HIMSELF WITHIN A BRICK WHEN HE SEES AN APPROACHING RATTIFER OR ZZYZZYXX CAN MOVE INTO THE SPACE WHERE THERE IS A GOLD HELMET. THE GOLD HELMET INTENSIFIES ZZYZZYXX'S GOAL TO REACH LOLA BY ALLOWING ZZYZZYXX TO USE THE HELMET TO ENCLOSE A RATTIFER OR BREAK THROUGH ONE BRICK WHICH IS OBSTRUCTING ZZYZZYXX'S COURSE TOWARDS LOLA.

AS IRREPROACHABLE AS LOLA APPEARS. LOLA IS OVERJOYED BY ZZYZZYXX'S SUCCESS TO RETRIEVE ENOUGH PRESENTS AND SHE WHISTLES RESOUNDINGLY TO LET ZZYZZYXX KNOW. AFTER ZZYZZYXX'S TRIUMPHANT DEED FOR LOVE. ZZYZZYXX BECOMES INVINCIBLE, ENABLING HIM TO ELUDE THE RATTIFERS BY IMPRISONING THEM WITHIN THEIR SPACES.

OTHER DANGERS TESTING ZZYZZYXX'S SKILLFUL MANEUVERING ARE FALLING BOMBS, RISING MISSILES AND CRACKED BRICKS, EACH CAPABLE OF DISINTEGRATING ZZYZZYXX.

AS AN ADDED ATTRACTION, WHEN A GAME PLAYER COMPLETES EACH LEVEL, THERE ARE ANIMATED CARTOONS DEPICTING ZZYZZYXX'S PASSIONATE DESIRE TO IMPRESS HIS LOVE FOR LOLA. ALSO DELIGHTFUL MUSIC THROUGHOUT THE GAME LEAVES THE PLAYERS HUMMING AND THEIR FOOT TAPPING.</desc>
