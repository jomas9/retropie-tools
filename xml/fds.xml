		<desc>THE HEIR TO THE THRONE IS SHARED BY FOUR BRAVE PEOPLE: DARIUS, SIMON, THALES, AND SONIA. THE 19 GODS OF OLYMPUS LEFT BEHIND AN OMNIPOTENT STONE TO THE GREAT EMPEROR ACHILLES, WHO HAS ORDERED A SEARCH TO BE CONDUCTED FOR THE STONE. YOU TAKE THE ROLE OF ONE OF THESE FOUR IN AN EFFORT TO FIND THE STONE ON THE ISLAND BEFORE THE REST, WAGING WAR WITH OPPONENT ARMIES TO PREVENT THEM FROM FINDING IT FIRST.NN19 IS SOMEWHAT UNIQUE AMONG TURN BASED STRATEGY GAMES, IN THAT TURNS ARE TAKEN IN REAL TIME, FOLLOWING RULES THAT ARE REMINISCENT OF THE JAPANESE CHESS-LIKE GAME KNOWN AS SHOGI. THE GAME TAKES PLACE ON AN OVERWORLD MAP, ON WHICH PLAYERS TAKE TURNS MOVING TROOPS. WHEN OPPOSING TROOPS VI FOR THE SAME LOCATION, THE GAME SWITCHES TO A ZOOMED-IN COMBAT SCREEN, SHOWING EACH INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THE OPPOSING FORCES. WHILE THE STORY OF THE GAME REVOLVES AROUND FINDING A STONE, THERE IS NO ACTUAL STONE TO DISCOVER. YOUR ONLY GOAL IS TO WIPE OUT THE ARMIES OF THE OTHER THREE OPPONENTS.</desc>

		<name>Akumajou Dracula II: Noroi no Fuuin</name>
		<desc>THE GAME'S SETTING TAKES PLACE SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE ORIGINAL CASTLEVANIA. THE PROLOGUE BEGINS WHEN SIMON VISITS HIS FAMILY'S RESTING GROUND. HIS BACK IS CRITICALLY INJURED FROM HIS LAST ENCOUNTER WITH DRACULA IN THE PREVIOUS GAME. HE SUDDENLY FEELS SOMEONE'S PRESENCE, AND TURNS TO SEE A YOUNG WOMAN STANDING WITHIN THE MIST. SHE TELLS HIM THAT A CURSE WAS PLACED UPON HIM BY DRACULA DURING THEIR LAST BATTLE, AND THAT HE DOES NOT HAVE LONG TO LIVE. THE WOMAN CONTINUES TO SAY THAT THE CURSE CAN BE UNDONE IF HE RESURRECTS DRACULA HIMSELF. SHE FURTHER EXPLAINS THAT DRACULA'S BODY WAS SPLIT INTO FIVE DIFFERENT PARTS AFTER HIS DEFEAT SEVEN YEARS AGO, AND SIMON MUST RECOVER THESE AND BRING THEM TO THE RUINS OF DRACULA'S CASTLE. THERE, HE MUST SEAL DRACULA AND DEFEAT HIM. BEFORE DISAPPEARING, THE UNKNOWN WOMAN SAYS SHE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THIS WILL DESTROY DRACULA PERMANENTLY.

DRACULA II - NOROI NO FUUIN (LIT. "DRACULA II: THE SEAL OF THE CURSE") IS AN ACTION-ADVENTURE GAME PRODUCED BY KONAMI. IT WAS ORIGINALLY RELEASED FOR THE FAMILY COMPUTER DISK SYSTEM IN JAPAN IN 1987, AND FOR THE NES IN NORTH AMERICA IN 1988. IT IS THE SECOND CASTLEVANIA TITLE RELEASED FOR THE NES, FOLLOWING THE ORIGINAL CASTLEVANIA. SET IN 1698, SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE EVENTS OF THE FIRST INSTALLMENT, THE PLAYER ONCE AGAIN ASSUMES THE ROLE OF VAMPIRE HUNTER SIMON BELMONT, WHO IS ON A JOURNEY TO UNDO A CURSE PLACED ON HIM BY DRACULA AT THE END OF THEIR PREVIOUS ENCOUNTER. SMALL DIFFERENCES EXIST BETWEEN THE JAPANESE VERSION AND THE AMERICAN VERSION. SPECIFICALLY THE JAPANESE VERSION TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE EXPANDED FM PROCESSING CAPABILITIES OF THE FDS HARDWARE TO PRODUCE BETTER SOUND, BUT IT CONTAINS LOAD SCENES WHEN ENTERING OR EXITING ANY TOWN OR MANSION. THE FDS VERSION ALSO HAS THREE SAVE SLOTS INSTEAD OF THE NES PASSWORD SYSTEM.</desc>

UNLIKE PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF LITTLE COMPUTER PEOPLE, THE PLAYABLE CHARACTER IS A GIRL WEARING A PINK DRESS AND BOW IN HER HAIR. THE ROOMS OF THE HOUSE ARE ALSO IN A DIFFERENT CONFIGURATION, FEATURING AN OUTDOOR BALCONY ON THE TOP FLOOR. WHEN THE GAME IS FIRST PLAYED, A NAME FOR THE CHARACTER IS CHOSEN AT RANDOM FROM A PREPROGRAMMED LIST. THERE ARE NO WINNING CONDITIONS ON THIS GAME YOU BASICALLY WATCH AND INTERACT WITH THE GIRL IN VARIOUS WAYS. HOWEVER, APPLE TOWN STORY LACKS MANY OF THE FEATURES FOUND IN OTHER VERSIONS OF LITTLE COMPUTER PEOPLE.</desc>

ALL THAT FLIES IS NOT AN ENEMY, THOUGH; YOU CAN ALSO SHOOT AT BLOCKS THAT, WHEN SHOT, MAKE UP A PICTURE OF A PRETTY GIRL ON THE RIGHT OF THE SCREEN. PICKING UP BONUSES IN THE SHAPE OF THE SIGNS FOR "PRETTY GIRL" POWERS UP YOUR WEAPON. WHEN ALL PIECES OF THE PICTURE ARE PICKED UP, YOU ARE GIVEN A CHANCE TO ENJOY THE PICTURE AT YOUR OWN PACE BEFORE PROGRESSING TO THE NEXT LEVEL (AND THE NEXT GIRL). 

THE GAMEPLAY CAN BE SPICED UP BY UPGRADING YOUR SPACESHIP INTO A MUCH MORE "PHALLIC" CONFIGURATION, WITH BULLETS LOOKING LIKE BIG SPERM, WHILE THE ENEMIES COME IN THE SHAPE OF SCISSORS, MOUTHS, PANTS AND SYRINGES. YOUR SHIP CAN ALSO GAIN A CONDOM SHIELD. WHEREAS THE MSX VERSION STARTS OFF LIKE A MORE NORMAL SHOOTER, PROGRESSIVELY BECOMING MORE VULGAR, THIS IS THE DEFAULT MODE IN THE FAMICOM VERSION.</desc>

		<desc>THE SECOND GAME IN THE FAMICOM GRAND PRIX SERIES. IN A DEPARTURE FROM ITS PREDECESSOR, FAMICOM GRAND PRIX II FEATURES A BEHIND-THE-CAR VIEW SIMILAR TO OUTRUN AND RAD RACER. RATHER THAN CONSISTING OF A HANDFUL OF SHORT TRACKS, 3D HOT RALLY PROVIDES THREE LONG TRACKS CONSISTING OF A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TERRAIN TYPES GIVING THE FEEL OF AN ACTUAL RALLY RACE. EACH TRACK HAS MULTIPLE ROUTES TO THE FINISH LINE, REQUIRING YOU TO FIND THE BEST PATH TO VICTORY. THE GAME FEATURES THREE CARS TO CHOOSE FROM: THE SPEEDY KATTOBI COUPE, THE BALANCED YONQUE TRUCK, OR THE RUGGED MONSTER BUGGY.



IN ORDER TO COMPLETE A RACE, PLAYERS MUST REACH EACH CHECKPOINT WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME LIMIT. IF THE LIMIT IS CROSSED TOO LATE, TIME IS SUBTRACTED FROM THEIR BANK. IF THE TIME BANK IS DEPLETED, THE RACE IS OVER. SUCCESSFULLY REACHING A CHECKPOINT BEFORE THE TIME LIMIT IS REACHED BANKS EXTRA TIME. PLAYERS CAN ALSO COLLECT EXCLAMATION MARKS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE TRACKS. COLLECTING ENOUGH EXCLAMATION MARKS TO FILL THE DASH METER ALLOWS TEMPORARY ACCESS TO THE HOT DASH, A FIFTH GEAR THAT GREATLY INCREASES SPEED. BEFORE EACH RACE, YOU'RE ASKED TO PLACE A REPAIR POINT SOMEWHERE ON THE TRACK, ALLOWING YOU TO REPAIR ANY DAMAGE DONE TO YOUR CAR, SO LONG AS YOU PICK A ROUTE THAT LEADS YOU PAST THAT CHECKPOINT. TAKING TOO MUCH DAMAGE PUTS YOU OUT OF THE RACE.



AS THE NAME IMPLIES, 3D HOT RALLY ALLOWS YOU TO USE THE FAMICOM 3D SYSTEM GLASSES TO GIVE THE RACE A REAL FEELING OF DEPTH. IT ALSO CHALLENGED PLAYERS TO SUBMIT THEIR BEST TIMES VIA FAMICOM DISK FAX KIOSKS LOCATED IN VARIOUS STORES FOR A CHANCE TO WIN A DISK-KUN STATIONARY SET.</desc>

THE GAME IS COMMONLY SITED AS HAVING VERY POOR CONTROLS, OFTEN REQUIRING THE PLAYER TO GRAB HOLD OF A WALL, AND VERY SLOWLY CLIMB IT BY HOLDING UP AND TAPPING JUMP REPEATEDLY. OTHER ISSUES INCLUDE A VERY LOW JUMP THAT PLACES MORE PLATFORMS AND ITEMS OUT OF REACH, AND A DIFFICULT TIME BRINGING THE CHARACTER BACK UNDER CONTROL IF HE STARTS TO SLIP.

AS THE PILOT OF A SHIP, YOU COULD DOCK WITH CERTAIN DUNGEON ENTRANCES, AND TAKE A SHUTTLE DOWN TO THE GROUND TO EXPLORE AND SEARCH FOR ITEMS. SEARCHING AROUND ISN'T EASY AT FIRST, SINCE YOU RUN OUT OF OXYGEN FAIRLY QUICKLY, AND THAT STARTS TO DRAIN YOUR LIFE, OF WHICH YOU START OUT WITH THREE BARS.TO WIN THE GAME, YOU MUST FIND THE MEDICINE NEEDED TO RESCUE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM A DISEASE IN YOUR HOME AREA.

		<desc>AN UPDATE OF SORTS TO GOLF. PLAYERS GET TO TAKE CONTROL OF NINTENDO'S MASCOTS MARIO AND LUIGI (IN THE 2 PLAYER GAME) AND PLAY OVER 18 HOLES OF GOLF ON COURSES MODELED AFTER REAL COURSES IN JAPAN.

PLAYERS CAN CHOOSE TO EITHER TRY THEIR SKILLS IN MATCH PLAY OR STROKE PLAY. MATCH PLAY INVOLVES TWO GOLFERS TRYING TO WIN THE MOST HOLES. THEY WIN HOLES BY GETTING THE BETTER SCORE THAN THEIR COMPETITOR. STROKE PLAY DIFFERS AS IT JUST INVOLVES THE GOLFER TRYING TO GET THE BEST SCORE POSSIBLE BY COMPLETING EACH HOLE IN AS FEW STROKES AS POSSIBLE.

WHEN ON THE GOLF COURSE, PLAYERS CAN CHOOSE THE CLUB THEY WANT TO USE, ADJUST THE SPEED AND STRENGTH (FROM A 1 TO 3 SCALE) OF THEIR SWING, AND AIM IN THE DIRECTION THEY WANT TO HIT THE BALL. HITTING THE BALL INVOLVES THE USE OF A METER WITH AN ICON THAT GOES BACK AND FORTH, WHICH GAUGES THE DISTANCE THE BALL IS HIT. PLAYERS CAN TAKE A STEP BACK FROM THE TEE AND TAKE PRACTICE SWINGS SO THEY CAN GET INTO A RHYTHM USING THIS METER.

THIS GAME ALSO CONTAINED A NOW DEFUNCT FEATURE WHERE PLAYERS COULD RECORD THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND THEIR BEST SCORES AND THEN BRING THE GAME DISK TO A DISK FAX MACHINE. INSERTING THE DISK INTO THIS MACHINE WOULD FAX OVER THE PLAYER'S INFORMATION TO NINTENDO'S HEADQUARTERS. THIS INFORMATION WAS USED FOR A CONTEST. BEING SELECTED A CONTEST WINNER WOULD AWARD THE PLAYER WITH A GOLDEN COLORED DISK VERSION OF THIS GAME. THIS GOLDEN DISK VERSION OF THE GAME CONTAINED AN EXCLUSIVE COURSE THAT WAS NOT PRESENT ON THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS GAME.</desc>

		<name>Golf: U.S. Course</name>
		<desc>A SLIGHTLY UPDATED COMPANION TITLE TO GOLF - JAPAN COURSE RELEASED JUST A FEW MONTHS EARLIER. THE GRAPHICS ARE MORE UPDATED AND THE GAMEPLAY IS A LITTLE MORE ADVANCED AS WELL. PLAYERS GET TO TAKE CONTROL OF NINTENDO'S MASCOTS MARIO AND LUIGI (IN THE 2 PLAYER GAME) AND PLAY OVER 18 HOLES OF GOLF ON COURSES MODELED AFTER REAL COURSES IN THE USA.

PLAYERS CAN CHOOSE TO EITHER TRY THEIR SKILLS IN MATCH PLAY OR STROKE PLAY. MATCH PLAY INVOLVES TWO GOLFERS TRYING TO WIN THE MOST HOLES. THEY WIN HOLES BY GETTING THE BETTER SCORE THAN THEIR COMPETITOR. STROKE PLAY DIFFERS AS IT JUST INVOLVES THE GOLFER TRYING TO GET THE BEST SCORE POSSIBLE BY COMPLETING EACH HOLE IN AS FEW STROKES AS POSSIBLE.

WHEN ON THE GOLF COURSE, PLAYERS CAN CHOOSE THE CLUB THEY WANT TO USE, ADJUST THE SPEED AND STRENGTH (FROM A 1 TO 3 SCALE) OF THEIR SWING, AND AIM IN THE DIRECTION THEY WANT TO HIT THE BALL. HITTING THE BALL INVOLVES THE USE OF A METER WITH AN ICON THAT GOES BACK AND FORTH, WHICH GAUGES THE DISTANCE THE BALL IS HIT. PLAYERS CAN TAKE A STEP BACK FROM THE TEE AND TAKE PRACTICE SWINGS SO THEY CAN GET INTO A RHYTHM USING THIS METER.

THIS GAME ALSO CONTAINED A NOW DEFUNCT FEATURE WHERE PLAYERS COULD RECORD THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND THEIR BEST SCORES AND THEN BRING THE GAME DISK TO A DISK FAX MACHINE. INSERTING THE DISK INTO THIS MACHINE WOULD FAX OVER THE PLAYER'S INFORMATION TO NINTENDO'S HEADQUARTERS. THIS INFORMATION WAS USED FOR A CONTEST. BEING SELECTED A CONTEST WINNER WOULD AWARD THE PLAYER WITH A GOLDEN COLORED DISK VERSION OF THIS GAME. THIS GOLDEN DISK VERSION OF THE GAME CONTAINED AN EXCLUSIVE COURSE THAT WAS NOT PRESENT ON THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS GAME.</desc>

		<name>Hikari Shinwa : Palthena no Kagami</name>
		<desc>IN A TIME WHERE HUMANS AND GODS COEXISTED IN HARMONY, THE KINGDOM OF ANGEL LAND WAS RULED BY TWO GODDESSES, PALUTENA THE GODDESS OF LIGHT AND MEDUSA THE GODDESS OF DARKNESS. WHILE PALUTENA ADMINISTERED THE LIGHT AND HELPED THE MORTALS CULTIVATE THEIR CROPS, MEDUSA DESPISED THE MORTALS AND USED THE DARKNESS TO DESTROY THEIR CROPS AND TURN THE MORTALS INTO STONE. ENRAGED, PALUTENA TRANSFORMED MEDUSA INTO A HIDEOUS MONSTER AND BANISHED HER INTO THE DARK UNDERWORLD.

BUT MEDUSA WOULD NOT GO QUIETLY. SHE ASSEMBLED AN ARMY OF MONSTERS AND EVIL SPIRITS OF THE UNDERWORLD TO CONQUER PALUTENA'S HOME, THE PALACE IN THE SKY. WAR ERUPTED AND MEDUSA'S MINIONS OVERWHELMED PALUTENA'S ARMY, EVENTUALLY IMPRISONING THE GODDESS OF LIGHT. MEDUSA THEN SEIZED THE THREE SACRED TREASURESÂTHE MIRROR SHIELD, THE ARROW OF LIGHT, AND THE WINGS OF PEGASUSÂAND GAVE THEM TO HER MOST POWERFUL MINIONS.

DEFEATED AND IMPRISONED, PALUTENA'S ONLY HOPE WAS TO SEEK THE HELP OF PIT, A YOUNG ANGEL TRAPPED IN THE UNDERWORLD. USING THE LAST OF HER STRENGTH, SHE SENT PIT A MAGICAL BOW. THUS, PIT SET OUT ON A QUEST TO ESCAPE THE UNDERWORLD, RETRIEVE THE SACRED TREASURES THAT WOULD HELP HIM DEFEAT MEDUSA, AND RESCUE PALUTENA AND RESTORE PEACE TO ANGEL LAND.

THE ORIGINAL FAMICOM DISK SYSTEM VERSIONS FEATURE SAVE SLOTS, UNLIKE THE NORTH AMERICAN VERSION WHICH USES A PASSWORD SYSTEM (KNOWN IN-GAME AS "SACRED WORDS"). AS WITH METROID, THE FDS VERSION OF KID ICARUS ALSO FEATURES HIGHER-QUALITY MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM'S ADDITIONAL SOUND CHANNELS.</desc>

		<name>Ice Hockey</name>
		<desc>THE PLAY AND MECHANICS OF ICE HOCKEY ARE MOSTLY SIMILAR TO THAT OF ICE HOCKEY IN REAL LIFE. THE OBJECTIVE FOR BOTH TEAM IS TO HIT A BLACK PUCK WITH A HOCKEY STICK THAT EACH PLAYER CARRIES INTO THE OPPONENT'S GOAL. TEAMS ARE MADE UP OF FIVE PLAYERS INCLUDING THE GOALTENDER, AS OPPOSED TO SIX IN REAL LIFE. PLAYERS WEAR ICE SKATES, WHICH ARE USED TO SKATE ACROSS THE ICY ARENA. EACH GAME IS MADE UP OF THREE PERIODS, WITH THE VICTORY GOING TO THE TEAM WHO HAS THE MOST POINTS AT THE END OF THE GAME. AT THE BEGINNING, TWO OPPOSING PLAYERS FROM EACH TEAM FACE OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RINK. THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF PLAYERS - THE FIRST IS FAST, WEAK, AND FEEBLE, BUT IS GOOD AT THE FACE-OFF; THE SECOND IS AVERAGE IN ALL QUALITIES, AND THE THIRD IS SLOW AND POOR AT THE FACE-OFF, BUT VERY POWERFUL, BOTH IN BODY CHECKING AND SHOOTING STRENGTH. THE ARENA IS SIMILARLY DESIGNED TO A REAL-WORLD ICE HOCKEY ARENA. THE ARENA IS COATED IN ICE, WITH A GOAL ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ARENA. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF MARKED AREAS, INCLUDING THE GOAL LINE THAT THE PUCK MUST CROSS TO SCORE, THE ATTACKING/DEFENDING ZONE WHICH IS SITUATED CLOSELY TO EACH GOAL, THE FACE-OFF SPOT, THE NEUTRAL SPOT, AND OTHERS. EACH SIDE OF THE ARENA HAS EXACTLY THE SAME DESIGN. IF TWO OPPOSING PLAYERS FIGHT FOR THE PUCK FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME, OTHER PLAYERS JOIN INTO THE FIGHT, RESULTING IN THE PLAYER FROM THE LOSING TEAM IN THE FIGHT TO BE PUT IN THE PENALTY BOX FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.</desc>

		<desc>THE PLAYER ASSUMES THE ROLE OF A KARATE COMPETITOR AND FIGHTS AGAINST ANOTHER PLAYER OR THE COMPUTER. USING TWO JOYSTICKS, PLAYERS CAN EXECUTE A NUMBER OF MOVES.

GAMEPLAY CONSISTS OF A TWO DIMENSIONAL FIGHT BETWEEN KARATE CHARACTERS WEARING WHITE AND RED GI, FOLLOWED BY VARIOUS BONUS ROUNDS FOR THE SUCCESSFUL PLAYER. THIS PATTERN REPEATS ITSELF IN THE NEXT, MORE CHALLENGING ROUND SET AGAINST A NEW BACKGROUND. UNLIKE MOST LATER FIGHTER-TYPE GAMES, THERE ARE NO HEALTH BAR OR HIT POINTS. A HIT SUCCESSFULLY LANDED ENDS THE ROUND AND EARNS THE PLAYER OR HIS OPPONENT EITHER ONE POINT OR HALF POINT (ALONG WITH A NUMERIC SCORE FOR THE TOP TEN BUT THIS HAS NO EFFECT ON WINNING A MATCH PER SE). THE FIRST TO SCORE TWO POINTS IS THE WINNER. IF THE PLAYER LOSES A BATTLE, THE GAME ENDS. THE GAME ALSO FEATURED SOME EARLY SPEECH SYNTHESIS, IN WHICH THE JUDGE WOULD CALL OUT SUCH PHRASES AS "FIGHT!" OR "WINNER!" IT'S ALSO SPOKEN IN JAPANESE IN THE JAPANESE VERSION.</desc>

		<name>Kieta Princess</name>
		<desc>THE KINGDOM OF RABIA'S PRINCESS GOES MISSING DURING A VISIT TO JAPAN, SURROUNDING THE INVESTIGATION OF THE MEDICINE TO AN "EPIDEMIC DEMENTIA," KNOWN AS "ONINOFUGURI", AND THE PREVENTION OF ITS IMPORTING. THE PLAYER TAKES THE ROLE OF A DETECTIVE DETERMINED TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY OF THE MISSING PRINCESS KILALA, IN THIS RPG STYLE ADVENTURE GAME. YASUKO TOMITA SERVED AS THE MODEL OF ONE OF THE CHARACTERS. CERTAIN TELEPHONE NUMBERS WOULD APPEAR, WHICH, IF CALLED, WOULD PROVIDE THE PLAYER WITH A HINT, SPOKEN BY YASUKO TOMITA.

IN ORDER TO TRACK DOWN KOBAYASHI, THE CRIMINAL PROTAGONIST, YOU MUST VISIT FIVE DIFFERENT TOWNS AND COLLECT INFORMATION. NEARY EVERY HOUSE AND BUILDING CAN BE ENTERED, WHICH WAS UNIQUE FOR ITS TIME. THE GAME ALSO FEATURES A HIGH DEGREE OF FREEDOM, ALLOWING YOU TO VISIT RESTAURANTS FOR A BITE, OR A DOJO TO TRAIN, OR TO HUNT FOR VEGETATION TO SELL FOR MONEY, WHILE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE PRINCESS.

ANOTHER INTRODUCED CONCEPT THAT WAS NOVEL FOR ITS TIME WAS THE NOTION OF DAY AND NIGHT CHANGING THE APPEARANCE OF THE CITY. DURING THE EVENING, YOU MAY ENCOUNTER A STREET GANG, AND THEY MAY OPEN FIRE ON YOU, ALTHOUGH YOU CAN DEFEND YOURSELF WITH A REVOLVER. HOWEVER, IF OVER 20 INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE GUNNED DOWN, YOU WILL BE ARRESTED AND SENT TO THE POLICE STATION WHERE YOU MUST PAY A FINE AND RETURN TO THE STARTING POINT.

THE DEGREE OF DIFFICULT THROUGHOUT THE GAME IS CONSIDERED QUITE HIGH, WITH VERY FEW HINTS TO HELP YOU OUT, WHILE OTHER HINTS ARE MISLEADING. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE HINT SUGGESTS THAT YOU IF YOU SLEEP OVER NIGHT AT A PARTICULAR CROSSROAD IN A CITY, YOU WILL GET A KEY ITEM, BUT THIS HINT IS FALSE. ALTHOUGH YOU ARE SUPPOSEDLY A DETECTIVE, YOU NEVER ACTUALLY GET TO ACCUSE ANYONE OF A CRIME.</desc>

LIKE IT'S PREQUEL THE GAME CHALLENGES PLAYER TO PIECE TOGETHER TEN IMAGES IN A JIGSAW PUZZLE LIKE FASHION. HOWEVER, EVERY PIECE IS EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE, AND THE IMAGES ON THE PIECES MOVE. RATHER THAN USING THE SHAPE OF THE EDGES TO DETERMINE WHAT PIECES FIT NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER, YOU MUST USE THE ANIMATION ON THE PIECES TO DETERMINE THEIR ARRANGEMENT. WHEN EACH PUZZLE BEGINS, THE PIECES ARE ALSO ORIENTED RANDOMLY, SO YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO FLIP THEM VERTICALLY OR HORIZONTALLY IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE PUZZLE. THERE ARE 10 DIFFERENT ANIMATIONS, AND YOU CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN DIVIDING THE IMAGES INTO 16, 24, OR 48 DISTINCT PIECES BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE. OBVIOUSLY, THE FEWER PIECES, THE EASIER IT IS TO SOLVE.</desc>

THE ADVENTURE OF LINK IS A DIRECT SEQUEL TO THE ORIGINAL THE LEGEND OF ZELDA, AND AGAIN INVOLVES THE PROTAGONIST LINK ON A QUEST TO SAVE PRINCESS ZELDA -- WHO IS NOT THE SAME PRINCESS FROM THE FIRST GAME, BUT ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE ROYAL FAMILY BY THE SAME NAME, WHO WAS PLACED UNDER A SLEEPING SPELL A LONG TIME AGO. THE ADVENTURE OF LINK'S EMPHASIS ON SIDE-SCROLLING AND RPG-STYLE ELEMENTS, HOWEVER, WAS A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM ITS PREDECESSOR AND HAS GIVEN IT A REPUTATION AS THE "BLACK SHEEP" OF THE ZELDA SERIES. IT IS ARGUABLY THE HARDEST ZELDA GAME. DESPITE THIS REPUTATION, THE GAME WAS HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL AND INTRODUCED MANY ELEMENTS THAT WOULD BECOME COMMONPLACE IN FUTURE ZELDA GAMES.</desc>

		<desc>THE GAME TAKES PLACE IN INDIA, WHERE A YOUNG MAN'S SIGNIFICANT-OTHER IS KIDNAPPED BY AN EVIL WIZARD. HE MUST THEN TACKLE THE FOUR AREAS OF THE LABYRINTH TEMPLE OF DABABA TO RESCUE HER.

IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK, THE PLAYER CANNOT SIMPLE MOVE ACROSS THE FLOOR. RATHER, THE PLAYER AND ALL OF THE ENEMIES HOP FROM ONE SQUARE TILE TO ANOTHER, THROUGHOUT THE GAME. IN A MAJORITY OF STAGES, THE PLAYER MUST UNCOVER THE SEALS WHICH WILL UNLOCK THE DOOR TO THE NEXT STAGE BY LEAPING ON TO THE PARTICULAR TILES WHICH KEEP THE SEALS CONCEALED. NOT EVERY DOOR WILL TAKE THE PLAYER FORWARD, HOWEVER, AS SOME DOORS ARE TRICK DOORS THAT MAY TAKE THE PLAYER TO A PREVIOUS STAGE. IN SOME STAGES, THE PLAYER MUST SIMPLY SURVIVE THE ONSLAUGHT OF ENEMIES, WHILE IN OTHERS, THE PLAYER IS RACING AGAINST THE CLOCK.</desc>

MICHAEL HAS TO CATCH FLOATING LETTERS IN ORDER TO SPELL OUT ENGLISH WORDS, WHILE AVOIDING THE INCORRECT LETTERS. THE GAME HAS VARIOUS DIFFERENT BACKDROPS, INCLUDING SPACE.

THE CHARACTER OF MICHAEL COMES FROM THE JAPANESE SERIAL MANGA STRIP "WHAT'S MICHAEL", CREATED BY MAKOTO KOBAYASHI WHICH MIGHT BE CONSIDERED ANALOGOUS TO GARFIELD, DUE TO THEM BOTH BEING ORANGE CATS. IT VARIES BETWEEN OBSERVING GOOFY PET BEHAVIOR TO MORE ABSTRACT TALES OF FANTASY WITH ANTHROPOMORPHIZED VERSIONS OF THE ANIMAL CHARACTERS.</desc>

		<desc>MONTY NO DOKI DOKI DAI DASSOU  (MONTY'S HEART POUNDING GREAT ESCAPE), ALSO KNOWN AS MONTY ON THE RUN, IS AN ACTION GAME DEVELOPED FOR THE FAMICOM DISK SYSTEM BY JALECO IN 1987. THIS GAME WAS THE PRODUCT OF JALECO ACQUIRING THE RIGHTS TO LICENSE AND PUBLISH A HIT GAME FROM THE EUROPEAN COMPUTER MARKET TITLED MONTY ON THE RUN. HOWEVER, UNLIKE A SIMILAR PREVIOUS EFFORT WITH KNIGHT LORE WHICH STAYS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, JALECO CHANGED THE GAME ENTIRELY FOR UNKNOWN REASONS.NNIN MONTY NO DOKI DOKI DAI DASSOU , MONTY IS A HUMAN BEING WHO HAS ESCAPED FROM A PENITENTIARY. STILL DRESSED IN STRIPED CONVICT CLOTHING, MONTY IS ON A MISSION TO CLEAR HIS NAME. HE MUST PROCEED THROUGH FOUR LEVELS, EACH OF WHICH CONTAINS SEVERAL HIDDEN TILES. THESE TILES CONTAIN PORTIONS OF THE IMAGE OF A FACE. AT THE END OF EACH LEVEL, MONTY MUST JUMP ON TO A PLATFORM JUST BEFORE THE EXIT. THIS PLATFORM IS A DIRECT CLUE TO THE PROPER CONSTRUCTION OF THE COLLECTED TILES. THERE ARE MORE TILES THAN NECESSARY TO CONSTRUCT A FACE, MAKING SOME TILES EXTRANEOUS. ONLY BY PAYING PROPER ATTENTION TO THIS FINAL PLATFORM CAN THE PLAYER KNOW WHICH FACE TO CONSTRUCT. AT THE END OF THE GAME, THE PLAYER MUST PROPERLY RECONSTRUCT THE FACE OF THE TRUE CRIMINAL BEFORE A JUDGE. IF THE PLAYER SUCCEEDS, HE WILL EARN HIS FREEDOM AND WIN THE GAME.</desc>

		<desc>THE GAME'S PROTAGONIST ENTERS TOKIMEKI HIGH SCHOOL AND RUNS INTO A GIRL WEARING GLASSES WHO LOOKS IDENTICAL TO MIHO NAKAYAMA. THOUGH THE GAME IS A STANDARD TEXT COMMAND-STYLE ADVENTURE GAME SIMILAR TO THE FAMICOM TANTEI CLUB SERIES, IN IMPORTANT SCENES, THE PLAYER IS REQUIRED TO SELECT A FACIAL EXPRESSION IN ADDITION TO A VERBAL RESPONSE. THE FOUR EXPRESSIONS (STRAIGHT FACE, LAUGHTER, SADNESS, ANGER) MUST MATCH THE CONTENT OF THE RESPONSE BEING GIVEN, AND ANY INCORRECT RESPONSES IMMEDIATELY LEAD TO THE "GAME OVER" SCREEN. THIS INCREASED THE GAME'S DIFFICULTY CONSIDERABLY IN COMPARISON TO OTHER TEXT ADVENTURE GAMES WHERE THERE WERE FEWER INCORRECT CHOICES. SOME SCENES SPECIFICALLY REQUIRE THAT THE DIALOGUE NOT MATCH WITH THE EXPRESSION. FOR INSTANCE, CHOOSING A DIALOGUE EXPRESSING JOY WITH A STRAIGHT FACE MAY BE THE CORRECT CHOICE IN A CERTAIN SITUATION BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS A DEEPER LEVEL OF EMOTION AND THOUGHT ON THE PART OF THE PROTAGONIST. THIS SYSTEM ALLOWED THE GAME TO SIMULATE A LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY RESEMBLING ACTUAL LOVE RELATIONSHIPS, LEADING TO ITS CLASSIFICATION AS A DATING SIMULATION RATHER THAN AN ADVENTURE GAME. THE GAME HAS TWO DIFFERENT ENDINGS, DEPENDING ON THE CHOICES MADE DURING THE GAME, AND THE PRIZES RECEIVABLE VIA THE DISK FAX NETWORK DIFFERED FOR EACH ENDING.</desc>

		<name>Nazo no Kabe : Block Kuzushi</name>
		<desc>IN THE YEAR 30XX, THE MANKIND HAS EXHAUSTED ALL THE METAL RESOURCES ON THE EARTH, SO THEY HAD TO TRAVEL INTO SPACE IN ORDER TO FIND MORE. THEY FIND A PLANET HIGH IN MINERALS, AND THEY NAME IT SELIM.

BUT SOON THEY DISCOVER THAT THERE IS SOMEONE WATCHING, SPYING ON THEM; IT'S SOME KIND OF ALIEN RACE. THESE ALIENS FIND A HOLE IN THE HUMANS' MAIN COMPUTER AND GET INSIDE IT. THE COMPUTER, PROGRAMMED TO SELF-DESTRUCT IN CASE OF A FAILURE, STARTS ITS COUNTDOWN.

THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO AVOID SELF-DESTRUCTION, WHICH IS ENTERING A 14 DIGIT CODE INTO THE MACHINE; BUT THESE DIGITS ARE HIDDEN IN THE WALLS OF THE CORRIDORS IN THE COMPLEX. YOUR MISSION IS TO FIND THESE LETTERS AND AVOID SELF-DESTRUCTION, ABOARD THE "RED WARRIOR", AND USING YOUR ONLY WEAPON, AN ENERGY BALL.

NAZO NO KABE - BLOCK KUZUSHI  IS AN ARKANOID CLONE FOR THE NES, BUT IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST SINGULAR CLONES. YOU'LL HAVE TO DESTROY ALL BLOCKS BUT ALSO THE WALLS SURROUNDING THEM, AS THE 14 LETTERS ARE SPREAD INSIDE THEM, APART FROM KILLING THE ALIEN BOSSES HERE AND THERE. IN YOUR WAY, YOU WILL FIND A BIZARRE MIXTURE OF ENEMIES, FROM ALIEN FORMS TO PARTS OF THE BODY (EYES, LIPS, SKULLS...), WHO WILL MAKE YOUR GAME TOUGHER BY CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF YOUR BALL; BUT ALSO HAPPIER BY DROPPING A SWEET VARIETY OF POWER-UPS SUCH AS THE CHERRIES (EXTRA LIFE), THE CLOCK (THE ENEMIES FREEZE), A ROCKET (TO THROW INTO THE BLOCKS), A FIRE DEVICE (THE BALL FIRES MISSILES), A PARACHUTE (SLOWS THE BALL) AN EXTRA BALL, OR THE WEIRDEST OF THEM ALL, THE SO-CALLED KONAMI MAN, WHO WILL TAKE YOU TO A SECRET PARALLEL COMPLEX WITH DIFFERENT (AND HARDER) LEVELS.</desc>

NAZO NO MURASAMEJOU IS A FAST-PACED ACTION GAME THAT HAS SOME SIMILARITIES WITH THE LEGEND OF ZELDA, ALTHOUGH IT IS FASTER AND HAS NONE OF THE RPG/ADVENTURE ELEMENTS. IT IS ALSO MUCH MORE LINEAR: YOU FIGHT THROUGH THE CASTLES ONE AFTER THE OTHER, WITH EACH STAGE CONSISTING OF THE PATH TO THE CASTLE AND THE CASTLE ITSELF, WHERE THE BOSS IS WAITING.

YOUR HAVE TWO WEAPONS: (UNLIMITED) SHURIKENS FOR RANGED ATTACKS AND A SWORD FOR MELEE COMBAT. THE SWORD IS AUTOMATICALLY USED WHEN YOU ARE CLOSE ENOUGH TO AN ENEMY, AND IT CAN ALSO BE USED TO DEFLECT ENEMY SHURIKENS. BUT SINCE YOU ARE CONSTANTLY UNDER ATTACK BY NINJAS FROM ALL DIRECTIONS AND ALSO HAVE ONLY A LIMITED TIME TO FINISH EACH STAGE, THE GAME IS STILL QUITE HARD.</desc>

		<desc>NAZOLER LAND SOUKAN GOU IS THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF MINIGAME COLLECTIONS FROM SUNSOFT DEVELOPED ESPECIALLY FOR NINTENDO'S FAMICOM DISK SYSTEM PERIPHERAL. IT WAS FOLLOWED BY TWO DIRECT SEQUELS AND A QUIZ-BASED SPIN-OFF.

NAZOLER LAND SOUKAN GOU (OR NAZOLER LAND VOL. 1) HAS EIGHT MINIGAMES THAT THE PLAYER CAN SELECT FROM A MENU AFTER LOADING THE GAME UP AND SWITCHING THE DISK AROUND. THESE ARE:
ROTATION MAZE

A MAZE-LIKE PUZZLE GAME WHERE A SMALL CIRCULAR BEING HAS TO PASS THROUGH A MAZE FILLED WITH DIVIDERS. THE PLAYER CAN ONLY PASS THROUGH THESE DIVIDERS IF THERE IS ROOM FOR IT TO TURN AROUND, OTHERWISE IT BLOCKS THE PLAYER'S PROGRESS. THE GOAL IS TO FIND THE CORRECT PATH THROUGH THE MAZE.
NAZOLER FORTUNE-TELLING

DESPITE USING SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC AND SUGGESTING A FORTUNE-TELLING ASPECT, THE GAME IS ACTUALLY A VARIANT ON THE CLASSIC STRATEGY BOARD GAME MASTERMIND: THE GOAL IS TO FIND THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF ZODIAC SYMBOLS, AND THE GAME WILL PROVIDE HINTS BY REPORTING WHENEVER THE PLAYER INCLUDES THE RIGHT SYMBOL, EITHER IN THE CORRECT PLACE (REPRESENTED BY A SOLID STAR) OR THE WRONG PLACE (REPRESENTED AS A HOLLOWED STAR).
SUPER JIGSAW

IN THIS GAME THE PLAYER SIMPLY HAS TO RECONSTRUCT AN IMAGE AFTER PIECES OF IT HAVE BEEN JUMBLED UP. ALL THE PLAYER MUST DO IS USE TWO CURSORS TO POINT TO THE TWO PIECES THEY WISH TO SWITCH AROUND. RESTORING THE IMAGE TO ITS INITIAL STATE COMPLETES THE CHALLENGE.
SAVE PRINCESS MOMOKO!

PROMOTED AS THE "MAJOR FEATURE", OR THE MOST FULLY-DEVELOPED OF THE MINIGAMES. THE GOAL IS TO EXPLORE A DUNGEON IN A FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE, SIMILAR TO CLASSIC DUNGEON CRAWLERS SUCH AS WIZARDRY, DUNGEON MASTER OR SHINING IN THE DARKNESS, WHILE FINDING ITEMS AND USING THE CORRECT ITEMS ON THE RIGHT MONSTERS TO PROCEED PAST THEM. ENCOUNTERING THESE MONSTERS BEFORE FINDING THE RIGHT ITEM TO DEFEAT THEM CAUSES THE PLAYER TO LOSE, SO THERE'S A DEGREE OF TRIAL AND ERROR.
JAPAN'S BEST SURROUNDINGS: ULTRA TRAVEL QUIZ

A QUIZ BASED ON TRAVELING AROUND JAPAN AND GENERAL GEOGRAPHICAL FACTS. THE PLAYER SELECTS WHICH TYPE OF TRANSPORTATION (TRAIN, PLANE, ETC.) THEY WISH TO TAKE AND ANSWERS QUESTIONS RELATING TO IT.
FAMICOM REACTION TEST

IN THIS SIMPLE "GAME", TWO PLAYERS COMPETE TO HIT THE BUTTON ON THEIR CONTROLLER AS MANY TIMES AS THEY CAN IN THE SHORT TIME LIMIT. THIS TEST IS PRESENTED LIKE A WILD WEST DUEL.
EXTRUSION PUZZLE

SIMILAR TO SUPER JIGSAW, ONLY THE PLAYER IS SLIDING BLOCKS AROUND TO MAKE A PUZZLE APPEAR. PUSHING ONE BLOCK THAT'S AGAINST ANOTHER CAUSES ALL TOUCHING BLOCKS TO MOVE AT ONCE.
3D MAZE

THE PLAYER MUST VISIT VARIOUS LOCATIONS AROUND JAPAN IN AN EFFORT TO "BATTLE" VARIOUS TRIVIA MASTERS, AND BEAT ALL EIGHT OF THEM IN ORDER TO CLAIM THE TITLE AS THE QUIZ KING. THE GAME WAS ONLY RELEASED IN JAPAN, AND HAS NEVER BEEN TRANSLATED FROM JAPANESE. AS A RESULT, A HIGH LEVEL OF JAPANESE KNOWLEDGE IS REQUIRED TO PLAY THIS GAME.</desc>

THE PLAYER CAN SELECT FROM A SET OF COMMANDS FOR THE HERO TO FOLLOW SUCH AS LOOKING AROUND, TALKING TO NPCS, PICKING UP ITEMS AND SO ON. WHILE THERE ARE BATTLES, THEY CAN ONLY BE RESOLVED BY FINDING THE RIGHT COMMAND (OFTEN THE RIGHT SPELL) RATHER THAN THE STANDARD RPG METHOD OF EXCHANGING BLOWS GOVERNED BY VARIOUS STATISTICS.</desc>

		<desc>SMASH PING PONG SIMULATES THE GAME OF PING-PONG OR TABLE TENNIS IN A REMARKABLY DIFFERENT MANNER THAN PRIOR SIMULATIONS OF ANY VARIETY OF TENNIS. RATHER THAN PUTTING THE EMPHASIS ON PRECISE CONTROL AND PLACEMENT OF THE PADDLE IN ORDER TO RETURN THE BALL, THE EMPHASIS IS ON TIMING AND STRATEGIC CONTROL OF THE BALL'S SPEED AND TRAJECTORY. THE PLAYER SEES NO OTHER ON-SCREEN REPRESENTATION OF THEMSELVES BEYOND A HAND HOLDING A PADDLE. THE HAND AND THE PADDLE AUTOMATICALLY MOVE LEFT AND RIGHT TO MATCH THE HORIZONTAL POSITION OF THE BALL. PLAYERS NEED ONLY CONCERN THEMSELVES WITH THE TIMING OF THEIR PADDLE SWING, AND THE STYLE OF SWING TO USE. PLAYERS CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN THREE DIFFERENT SWINGS, ALONG WITH THE CHOICE OF FOREHAND OR BACKHAND. 

THE FAMICOM DISK SYSTEM CONVERSION WAS DEVELOPED BY KONAMI, AND PUBLISHED DIRECTLY BY NINTENDO AS SMASH PING PONG. AS A RESULT,KONAMI'S PENGUIN MASCOT PENTAROU WAS REPLACED BY DISKUN, THE FAMICOM DISK SYSTEM MASCOT, ON THE TITLE SCREEN, AND DONKEY KONG JR. APPEARS IN THE STANDS ON THE RIGHT SIDE. THE CONVERSION OFFERS SEVERAL VARIATIONS OF PLAY, INCLUDING ONE OR TWO PLAYER GAMES, PLAYS TO 11 OR 21 POINTS, AND FIVE LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY. ADDITIONALLY, DEUCE WIN CONDITIONS DO NOT END AT 15 POINTS, BUT CAN CLIMB AS HIGH AS 99 POINTS.</desc>

HUDSON SOFT LICENSED THE RIGHTS TO BRING THE GAME TO NINTENDO'S FAMICOM, AND IT WAS RELEASED IN 1984 AS ONE OF THE FIRST 3RD PARTY GAMES EVER MADE FOR THE SYSTEM AND IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE HIT. AROUND THE SAME TIME, IREM LICENSED THE RIGHTS TO PRODUCE AN ARCADE VERSION OF LODE RUNNER WHICH THEY ALSO RELEASED IN 1984, ALONG WITH THREE OTHER SEQUELS THROUGH 1986. THESE ARCADE VERSIONS MADE A FEW TWEAKS TO THE ORIGINAL GAME PLAY, AND THE FINAL ARCADE GAME INTRODUCED A TWO PLAYER COOPERATIVE MODE.

IN 1987, IREM DECIDED TO PACKAGE A NUMBER OF SELECT STAGES FROM ALL FOUR OF THE ARCADE GAMES INTO ONE TITLE, AND RELEASED IT IN DISK FORMAT FOR THE FAMICOM DISK SYSTEM, ENTITLED SUPER LODE RUNNER. THOUGH THE GRAPHICS WERE NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS THE ARCADE GAMES, THEY WERE CLOSE, AND IREM BROUGHT MANY OF THE GAME PLAY CHANGES TO FAMICOM PLAYERS, INCLUDING THE NEW TWO PLAYER MODE. IREM RELEASED A SEQUEL LATER ON THAT SAME YEAR. A DIFFERENT VERSION OF THE GAME WAS RELEASED FOR THE MSX WITH THE SAME TITLE.</desc>

THE PLAYER TAKES CONTROL OF A CARTOON-LIKE ANTHROPOMORPHIC SPACECRAFT, WITH PLAYER 1 TAKING CONTROL OF TWINBEE, THE TITULAR SHIP, WHILE PLAYER 2 CONTROLS WINBEE. THE GAME CONTROLS CONSISTS OF A JOYSTICK AND TWO BUTTONS: ONE FOR SHOOTING ENEMIES IN THE AIR AND THE OTHER FOR DROPPING BOMBS TO GROUND ENEMIES (SIMILARLY TO XEVIOUS).

THE PLAYER'S PRIMARY POWER-UPS ARE BELLS THAT CAN BE UNCOVERED BY SHOOTING AT THE FLOATING CLOUDS WHERE THEY'RE HIDDEN. IF THE PLAYER CONTINUES SHOOTING THE BELL AFTER IT APPEARS, IT WILL CHANGE INTO ONE OF FOUR OTHER COLORS: THE REGULAR YELLOW BELLS ONLY GRANT BONUS POINTS, THE WHITE BELL WILL UPGRADE THE PLAYER'S GUN INTO A TWIN CANNON, THE BLUE BELL INCREASES THE PLAYER'S SPEED (FOR UP TO FIVE SPEED LEVELS), THE GREEN BELL WILL ALLOW THE PLAYER TO CREATE IMAGE COPIES OF ITS SHIP FOR ADDITIONAL FIREPOWER, AND THE RED BELL WILL PROVIDE THE PLAYER'S SHIP A BARRIER THAT ALLOWS IT TO SUSTAIN MORE DAMAGE. THE GREEN AND RED BELLS CANNOT BE COMBINED TOGETHER. OTHER POWER-UPS CAN ALSO BE RETRIEVED FROM GROUND ENEMIES SUCH AS AN ALTERNATE BELL THAT GIVES THE PLAYER'S SHIP A THREE-WAY GUN, A STAR WHICH ELIMINATES ALL ON-SCREEN ENEMIES.

AS WITH OTHER GAMES OF THE SAME GENRE, GETTING SHOT BY A SINGLE ENEMY BULLET WILL CAUSE THE PLAYER TO LOSE A LIFE. HOWEVER, IF THE BULLET ONLY STRIKES EITHER SIDE OF THE SHIP INSTEAD, THE PLAYER'S SHIP WILL ONLY LOSE ONE OF ITS ARMS. IF THE PLAYER'S SHIP LOSES BOTH ARMS, IT WILL LOSE THE ABILITY TO THROW BOMBS AND THE PLAYER MUST WAIT FOR AN AMBULANCE TO ARRIVE. THE PLAYER MUST NAVIGATE THEIR SHIP TO THE AMBULANCE TO REPAIR THEIR ARMS. HOWEVER, IF THE PLAYER'S SHIP LOSES BOTH ARMS FOR THE SECOND TIME, NO AMBULANCE WILL ARRIVE.

IF TWO PLAYERS ARE PLAYING AT THE SAME TIME, THEY CAN ALIGN THEIR SHIPS VERTICALLY OR HORIZONTALLY TOGETHER TO PERFORM MORE POWERFUL ATTACKS</desc>

IT WAS LATER RELEASED OUTSIDE OF JAPAN IN AN ALTERED FORMAT UNDER THE NAME SUPER MARIO BROS. 2, SINCE THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE SUPER MARIO BROS. SEQUEL, SUPER MARIO BROS.: THE LOST LEVELS, WAS DEEMED TOO SIMILAR TO THE ORIGINAL AND TOO DIFFICULT FOR OVERSEAS PLAYERS.

THE EVIL MAMU SUDDENLY APPEARS, AND HIS HUGE THREE-FINGERED HAND PULLS THEM INTO A QUIRKY DREAM WORLD. 

THE GOAL OF DOKI DOKI PANIC IS TO HELP THE WHOLE FAMILY (NAMELY IMAJIN, LINA AND THEIR PARENTS MAMA AND PAPA) RESCUE THEIR POOR CHILDREN KIDNAPED BY THE EVIL KING LIZARD. EACH MEMBER HAS ITS OWN STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES - IMAJI IS A BALANCED CHARACTER WHEREAS LINA IS FAIRLY LIGHT WEIGHT AND CAN EFFORTLESSLY HOVER AND FLY OVER SHORT DISTANCES, BUT SHE IS REALLY SLOW AT PICKING UP ITEMS. PAPA IS THE STRONGEST OF THE GROUP AND CAN THROW ENEMIES AND ITEMS REALLY FAR, WHEREAS MAMA CAN JUMP HIGHER THAN ANYONE. AS AFOREMENTIONED, EACH CHARACTER CAN CARRY ENEMIES, ITEMS, AND ESPECIALLY RADISHES AND OTHER VEGETABLES THAT CAN BE PULLED OUT OF THE GROUND AND USED AS LETHAL WEAPONS. THE GAME FEATURES A MYRIAD OF OTHER ITEMS, SUCH AS BOMBS (SELF EXPLANATORY), POWER BLOCKS (SIMILAR TO MARIO BROS'S POW BLOCKS THAT KILL ALL ENEMIES ON SCREEN), STARS (TEMPORARY INVINCIBILITY), KEYS (TO UNLOCK DOORS), HEARTS (EXTRA HEALTH) OR THE MYSTERIOUS MAGIC LAMPS THAT OPEN DOORS TO THE DARK WORLD - MIRROR AREAS WHERE OUR HEROES CAN FIND SPECIAL ITEMS OR HEART CONTAINERS. 

DOKI DOKI PANIC FOLLOWS A STORY BOOK STRUCTURE, AND IS MADE OUT OF SEVEN CHAPTERS (AREAS) AND TWENTY PAGES (LEVELS). INTERESTINGLY, ALTHOUGH THE PLAYER CAN PLAY THE DOKI DOKI PANIC WITH ANY CHARACTER, IT HAS TO EVENTUALLY DEFEAT THE EVIL MAMU WITH ALL FOUR TO FINALLY BEAT THE GAME (THE PLAYER CAN SEPARATELY SAVE EACH CHARACTER'S PROGRESS).</desc>

		<desc>YUU MAZE ("MAZE PLAY") IS A SINGLE-SCREEN MAZE GAME AKIN TO NAMCO'S CLASSIC PAC-MAN AND ITS MANY OTHER IMITATORS IN THAT THE GOAL OF THE GAME IS TO DRIVE THE FUTURISTIC VEHICLE AROUND A MAZE COLLECTING DOTS WHILE AVOIDING (OR TEMPORARILY ELIMINATING) THE ENEMIES. TAITO, ONE OF THE LARGEST MANUFACTURERS OF ARCADE GAMES AT THE TIME (NOT TO MENTION THE CREATORS OF SPACE INVADERS), WOULD PRODUCE SIMILARLY ARCADE-REMINISCENT GAMES FOR THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO TAP INTO THE PORTION OF THE MARKET NOSTALGIC FOR CLASSIC ARCADE EXPERIENCES.YUU MAZE ADDS A FEW INNOVATIONS TO THE FORMAT: EACH MAZE HAS A DIFFERENT STRUCTURE, DIFFERENT ENEMIES AND DIFFERENT LAY-OUTS FOR THE PELLETS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE LEVEL; THE PLAYER CAN FIND POWER-UPS WHICH GRANT WEAPONS, SHIELDS AND SPEED-UPS TO THEIR VEHICLE. THE PLAYER'S VEHICLE ALSO HAS SOME DEGREE OF INERTIA: THERE'S A SLIGHT DELAY WHEN ATTEMPTING TO ACCELERATE AFTER STOPPING OR PERFORMING A U-TURN, BUT IF THE PLAYER KEEPS MOVING AND CHANGES DIRECTION ONLY AT 90 DEGREE INTERVALS, THEY CAN KEEP MOVING AT THEIR MAXIMUM SPEED. THIS IS OFTEN NECESSARY TO KEEP AHEAD OF THE FAST MOVING ENEMIES.</desc>

		<name>Zelda no Densetsu : The Hyrule Fantasy</name>
		<desc>A SMALL KINGDOM IN THE LAND OF HYRULE, THE SETTING OF THE GAME, IS ENGULFED IN CHAOS AFTER AN ARMY LED BY GANON, THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS, INVADED IT AND STOLE THE TRIFORCE OF POWER, A PART OF A MAGICAL ARTIFACT BESTOWING GREAT STRENGTH. IN AN ATTEMPT TO PREVENT GANON FROM ACQUIRING THE TRIFORCE OF WISDOM, ANOTHER OF THE PIECES, PRINCESS ZELDA SPLITS IT AND HIDES THE EIGHT FRAGMENTS IN SECRET DUNGEONS THROUGHOUT THE LAND. BEFORE THE PRINCESS IS EVENTUALLY KIDNAPPED BY GANON, SHE COMMANDS HER NURSEMAID IMPA TO FIND SOMEONE COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO SAVE THE KINGDOM. WHILE WANDERING THE LAND, THE OLD WOMAN IS SURROUNDED BY GANON'S HENCHMEN, THOUGH A YOUNG BOY NAMED LINK APPEARS AND RESCUES HER.  AFTER HEARING IMPA'S PLEA, HE RESOLVES TO SAVE ZELDA AND SETS OUT TO REASSEMBLE THE SCATTERED FRAGMENTS OF THE TRIFORCE OF WISDOM, TO BECOME POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DEFEAT GANON.

THE LEGEND OF ZELDA INCORPORATES ELEMENTS OF ACTION, ADVENTURE, AND ROLE-PLAYING GAMES. THE PLAYER CONTROLS LINK FROM A FLIP-SCREEN OVERHEAD PERSPECTIVE AS HE TRAVELS IN THE OVERWORLD, A LARGE OUTDOOR MAP WITH VARIED ENVIRONMENTS. LINK BEGINS THE GAME ARMED ONLY WITH A SMALL SHIELD, BUT A SWORD BECOMES AVAILABLE TO LINK AFTER HE VENTURES INTO A CAVE THAT IS ACCESSIBLE FROM THE GAME'S FIRST MAP SCREEN. THROUGHOUT THE GAME, VARIOUS CHARACTERS AID LINK BY GIVING OR SELLING EQUIPMENT AND CLUES. THESE PEOPLE CAN BE FOUND IN CAVES SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE OVERWORLD; SOME ARE READILY ACCESSIBLE, WHILE OTHERS ARE HIDDEN BEHIND OBSTACLES SUCH AS ROCKS, TREES, AND WATERFALLS

NINTENDO ORIGINALLY RELEASED THE GAME AS THE LAUNCH TITLE FOR THE FAMILY COMPUTER'S NEW DISK SYSTEM PERIPHERAL. THE LEGEND OF ZELDA WAS JOINED BY A RE-RELEASE OF SUPER MARIO BROS., TENNIS, BASEBALL, GOLF, SOCCER, AND MAHJONG IN ITS INTRODUCTION OF THE DISK SYSTEM. IT MADE FULL USE OF THE DISK CARD MEDIA'S ADVANTAGES OVER TRADITIONAL ROM CARTRIDGES WITH A DISK SIZE OF 128 KILOBYTES, WHICH WAS EXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE ON CARTRIDGE FORMAT. DUE TO THE STILL-LIMITED AMOUNT OF SPACE ON THE DISK, HOWEVER, IT WAS ONLY IN KATAKANA. RATHER THAN PASSWORDS, IT USED REWRITABLE DISKS TO SAVE THE GAME. IT USED THE EXTRA SOUND CHANNEL PROVIDED BY THE DISK SYSTEM FOR CERTAIN SOUND EFFECTS; MOST NOTABLE ARE THE SOUNDS OF LINK'S SWORD WHEN HIS HEALTH IS FULL, THE ROARS AND GROWLS OF DUNGEON BOSSES, AND ENEMY DEATH SOUNDS. THE SOUND EFFECTS USED THE FAMICOM'S PCM CHANNEL IN THE CARTRIDGE VERSION. IT ALSO USED THE MICROPHONE BUILT INTO THE FAMICOM'S CONTROLLER THAT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE NES. THIS LED TO CONFUSION IN THE U.S. AS THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL READS THAT POLS VOICE, A RABBIT-LIKE ENEMY IN THE GAME, "HATES LOUD NOISE". BLOWING OR SHOUTING INTO THE FAMICOM'S MICROPHONE KILLS THESE CREATURES. HOWEVER, THEY CANNOT BE KILLED THROUGH USE OF THE RECORDER, AND ON THE NES MUST BE KILLED WITH WEAPONS.</desc>
