		<name>3x3 Eyes : Juuma Houkan</name>
		<desc>THE GAME IS BASED ON THE MANGA SERIES 3X3 EYES. LONG TIME AGO, IN ANCIENT CHINA, A GROUP OF PEOPLE DISCOVERED THE SECRET OF IMMORTALITY. THEY BECAME SAN ZHI YAN (SANJIYAN IN JAPANESE PRONUNCIATION), OR "THREE-EYED ONES", AND POSSESSED SUPERNATURAL POWERS THAT WERE MANIFESTED IN A THIRD EYE EACH ONE OF THEM HAD. ONE OF THE SAN ZHI YAN, A GIRL NAMED PAI, LONGED TO BECOME A NORMAL HUMAN AGAIN. SHE WAS AIDED BY THE JAPANESE SCIENTIST AND EXPLORER FUJII, WHO MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED IN TIBET SOME TIME. FUJII'S SON, YAKUMO, BECAME CONNECTED TO PAI BY MERGING HIS SOUL WITH HER AND BECOMING A WU, AN IMMORTAL BEING. NOW THEY BOTH TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD, TRYING TO REGAIN THEIR HUMAN ESSENCE, AND HAVING THEIR BASE IN HONG-KONG, WORKING FOR LI LINGLING, THE HEAD OF THE MONSTER FIGHTING AGENCY.

THIS GAME FOLLOWS THE STORY OF VOLUMES 8 TO 11 OF THE MANGA. LINGLING DISCOVERS A LETTER LEFT BY FUJII, WHERE HE REPORTS ABOUT A STRANGE TRIBE THAT CAN CONTROL BEASTS. YAKUMO IS ORDERED TO TRAVEL TO NEPAL, BUT FIRST HE HAS TO FIND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE MYSTERIOUS TRIBE BY CONTACTING PEOPLE IN HONG-KONG.

THE GAME IS A MIXTURE OF PUZZLE-SOLVING ADVENTURE AND PLATFORM ACTION, WITH THE EMPHASIS ON THE FIRST. YAKUMO MOVES AROUND THE GAMEWORLD, PICKING OBJECTS AND MANIPULATING THEM IN ORDER TO SOLVE PUZZLES, AND TALKING TO CHARACTERS. BUT HE CAN ALSO JUMP, CLIMB ON LADDERS, RUN, AND SOMETIMES FIGHT ENEMIES IN PLATFORM-STYLE.</desc>

IT SUPERFICIALLY RESEMBLES HUDSON'S BOMBERMAN SERIES, WITH ITS TOP-DOWN GRID STAGES AND CHAOTIC GAMEPLAY, BUT RATHER THAN LEAVING BOMBS AND WAITING FOR THEM TO EXPLODE, THE PLAYER CAN SHOOT ENERGY AT BLOCKS AND EACH OTHER.

THE GOAL IS TO SNEAK UP BEHIND THE OPPONENT AND SHOOT THEM BEFORE THEY CAN RECIPROCATE. VARIOUS POWER-UPS MAY APPEAR AFTER DESTRUCTIBLE BLOCKS ARE REMOVED, WHICH CAN GIVE THE PLAYER AN EDGE OR, IN THE CASE OF THE ? ICON, A POSSIBLE RANDOM NEGATIVE EFFECT LIKE REVERSED CONTROLS.

TO FIGHT WHOEVER FLIES THAR YONDER IN THE DISTANCE, YOU SEND OUT PROJECTILES, IN OUR CASE FIREBALLS. THESE BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON WHICH OF THE FOUR MAIN BUTTONS YOU PRESS: IF YOU PRESS THE A BUTTON, THEY FLY IN A CURVE TOWARDS THE UPPER RIGHT PART OF THE SCREEN, IF YOU PUSH THE Y BUTTON, THEY GO LEFT AND DOWN AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. SADLY, THEY MOVE SO SLOWLY YOUR OPPONENT HAS A GOOD THREE SECONDS TO GET OUT OF THE WAY, AND IN SO WEIRD CURVES THAT AIMING IS IMPOSSIBLE. ALSO, THE SCREEN CONSTANTLY TWISTS IN ALL DIRECTIONS.</desc>

FALLING BEHIND OR RUNNING INTO A HEDGE OR JUMP WILL CAUSE THE HORSE TO LOSE STAMINA, AND LOSING ALL STAMINA CAUSES IT TO COLLAPSE BRIEFLY. THE PLAYER NEEDS TO KEEP A STEADY PACE, STEER CAREFULLY AROUND CORNERS, JUMP AT THE RIGHT TIMES AND USE THE BOOST SPARINGLY IN ORDER TO WIN. IN THE BATTLE MODE STAMINA IS LESS OF A CONCERN AND THE GAME MORE RESEMBLES RC PRO-AM: THE PLAYERS HAVE TO SIMPLY FOLLOW THE COURSE AND AVOID THE DANGERS AS THEY SHOW UP.</desc>

		<desc>THE GAME IS BASED ON THE JAPANESE MANGA AND ANIMÉ SERIES BISHOUJO SENSHI: SAILOR MOON - "BISHOUJO SENSHI" ROUGHLY MEANING "PRETTY YOUNG GIRL WARRIOR". IT IS SET IN THE 30TH CENTURY, IN A FUTURISTIC CITY CRYSTAL TOKYO. IN THIS CITY LIVES A TOTALLY ORDINARY (AT FIRST) FOURTEEN-YEAR OLD GIRL USAGI. WHEN SHE MEETS A MAGICAL CAT NAMED LUNA, SHE FINDS OUT THAT SHE IS IN FACT A PRINCESS SENT TO THE FUTURE IN ORDER TO FIGHT THE MINIONS OF DARKNESS. SHE DISCOVERS WITHIN HERSELF THE POWER TO TRANSFORM INTO THE HERO OF DARKNESS, SAILOR MOON, MEETS OTHER WARRIORS WHO HELP HER ON HER QUEST, AND FIGHTS THE EVIL QUEEN BERYL, HOSTILE ALIENS, AND OTHER FOES.

THE EVENTS OF THIS GAME TAKE PLACE SHORTLY AFTER BISHOUJO SENSHI SAILOR MOON S, THE FOURTH VOLUME OF THE LONG-RUNNING SERIES. A GLOBAL PEACE IS ESTABLISHED IN THE UNIVERSE, BUT LATELY SUSPICIOUS THINGS ARE HAPPENING. A STRANGE METEORITE IS SEEN APPROACHING THE EARTH. STREET GANGS AND SPIES WHO WORK FOR A MYSTERIOUS PERSON CALLED APSU ARE SEEN IN CRYSTAL TOKYO. AND THE MYSTIC SILVER CRYSTAL, THE GINZUISHOU, WHICH PROTECTS THE CITY, IS SHAKING! USAGI AND HER FRIENDS MUST NOW INVESTIGATE THE STRANGE EVENTS AND FACE THE FORCES OF DARKNESS ONCE AGAIN.

THE GAME IS A CONSOLE-STYLE RPG IN  FINAL FANTASY STYLE (BATTLES WITH YOUR PARTY TO THE RIGHT AND THE ENEMIES TO THE LEFT), WITH A BATTLE SYSTEM SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THAT OF  CHRONO TRIGGER: YOU MUST FORM A PARTY OUT OF SEVERAL AVAILABLE CHARACTERS, MAKE THEM PARTICIPATE IN BATTLES TOGETHER, AND LEARN POWERFUL COMBO ATTACKS.</desc>

		<name>Captain Tsubasa J : The Way to World Youth</name>
		<desc>A 1995 JAPAN-EXCLUSIVE CAPTAIN TSUBASA VIDEO GAME DEVELOPED AND PUBLISHED BY BANDAI AND WAS THE FINAL CAPTAIN TSUBASA GAME FOR THE SUPER FAMICOM.
THIS GAME SUFFERED LOTS OF CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS GAMES MADE BY TECMO, THIS TIME YOU WILL BE PLAYING IN A REAL SOCCER FIELD AND IN REAL TIME, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU NEED TO PRESS CERTAIN KEYS EVEN WITHOUT HAVING THE CHANCE OF STOPPING THE TIME (LIKE IN PREVIOUS GAMES), WHEN A CERTAIN PLAYER IS CONFRONTED WITH A ONE THAT HE CONSIDERS HIS RIVAL (LIKE MISUGI AND SCHNEIDER OR TSUBASA AND *ANY OTHER PLAYER*, FOR EXAMPLE) THEY WILL HAVE A FIGHT, WHICH IS MAINLY A BUTTON SMASHING SEQUENCE. THE SAME GOES FOR THE SEQUENCE IN WHICH A GOALKEEPER TRIES TO STOP ANY OF THE SPECIAL SHOTS.
THIS GAME HAS ALMOST THE SAME STORY AS THE CAPTAIN TSUBASA J ANIME, EXCEPT THAT THIS ONE WILL FINISH WITH A SPECIAL MATCH AGAINST AN EXTRA TEAM. SO, YOU'LL PLAY ACROSS VARIOUS CHAPTERS, PLAYING WITH AOI SHINGO IN ITALY OR CONTROLLING THE MYTHIC OZORA TSUBASA IN HIS MATCH AGAINST THE BRAZILLIAN PRODIGY, CARLOS SANTANA (NOPE, HE ISN'T THE SINGER). YOU'LL ALSO PLAY WITH JAPAN NATIONAL TEAM AGAINST THE SAME OPPONENTS AS THEY DID IN THE ANIME VERSION..</desc>

		<desc>CHINHAI IS A PUZZLE GAME FOR THE SUPER FAMICOM AND A VARIANT ON MAHJONG SOLITAIRE, OR SHANGHAI. INSTEAD OF PAIRING AND REMOVING ANY TWO TILES THAT MATCH AS LONG AS ONE OF THEIR SIDES IS CLEAR, AS IS THE CASE IN SHANGHAI, THE RULES OF CHINHAI REQUIRE THAT THE TWO TILES CAN ONLY BE REMOVED IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO DRAW A LINE BETWEEN THE TWO THAT DOESN'T MAKE A 90 DEGREE TURN MORE THAN TWICE. TWO TILES ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE BOARD, FOR INSTANCE, CAN'T BE PAIRED BECAUSE IT WOULD TAKE THREE 90 DEGREE TURNS TO DRAW A LINE BETWEEN THEM. TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS ADDED DIFFICULTY, THE GAME LACKS THE "STACKS" OF TILES THAT FREQUENTLY APPEAR IN SHANGHAI, INSTEAD PRESENTING A FLAT BOARD OF TILES.CHINHAI IS NAMED FOR THE MUNICIPALITY OF CHINHAI IN CHINA, MAINTAINING THE THEME OF NAMING MAHJONG SOLITAIRE VARIANTS AFTER TERRITORIES IN CHINA. CHINHAI HAS LONG SINCE BEEN RENAMED ZHENHAI, WHICH IS SITUATED IN THE NINGPO PREFECTURE AND NOW PART OF A MUCH LARGER CITY. THIS MAHJONG SOLITAIRE VARIANT IS PERHAPS BEST KNOWN AS SICHUAN OR SHISENSHOU, ALSO NAMED FOR A PROVINCE IN CHINA.</desc>

INSTEAD OF BEING ANOTHER SIDE-SCROLLING SHOOTER, BAKURETSU RANTOUDEN IS ACTUALLY A ONE-ON-ONE 2D FIGHTER A LA STREET FIGHTER IN WHICH THE MOST RECOGNIZABLE CHARACTERS FROM THE CHO ANIKI SERIES (YES THE SPEEDO WEARING BODYBUILDERS INCLUDED) FIGHT EACH OTHER FOR ULTIMATE SUPREMACY USING SPECIAL ATTACKS AND MOVES.

AN INTERESTING FEATURE IS THAT THE GAME HONORS IT'S SHOOTER ROOTS, THEREFORE INSTEAD OF BEING RESTRICTED TO WALKING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN THE 2D PLANE AND JUMPING AROUND AS IN OTHER FIGHTING GAMES, IN THIS GAME ALL THE CHARACTERS CAN FLY MEANING THE FIGHTS ACTUALLY OCCUR IN MID-AIR ALLOWING THE PLAYERS TO DASH ALL OVER THE SCREEN.

THE CHIEF WIZARD REALIZES THAT THE DEMON BALAAM IS TRYING TO LINK THE WORLD OF WOZZ WITH THE WORLD OF HUMANS. ONLY A HUMAN HERO CAN STOP BALAAM, AND THE WIZARD'S TELEPORTING MAGIC BRINGS... THREE YOUNG HUMANS: THE JAPANESE GIRL REONA KITAZATO, AND TWO BOYS: THE AMERICAN SHOT PHOENIX AND THE CHINESE CHUN CHINGTAO. WILL THOSE YOUNGSTERS BE ABLE TO STOP BALAAM?

THE GAME IS A TRADITIONAL CONSOLE-STYLE RPG SIMILAR TO BREATH OF FIRE: TURN-BASED BATTLES ARE VIEWED FROM AN ISOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE. YOU CONTROL ALL THREE CHARACTERS AS A PARTY, BUT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME YOU CHOOSE ONE OF THEM AS THE MAIN CHARACTER, AND THEREFORE WILL SEE THE GAME FROM HIS/HER PERSPECTIVE. IN CASE THE CHARACTERS SPLIT UP, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO CONTROL ONLY THE ONE YOU CHOSE.</desc>

WHEN STARTING A GAME OR CONTINUING THE PLAYER PICKS FROM EITHER HIKARU, MAX, OR MILLIA. EACH FLIES A CUSTOM VALKYRIE WITH ITS OWN SET WEAPON LOAD-OUT. A VALKYRIE CHANGES ITS WEAPON AND MOVEMENT SPEED BY SWITCHING BETWEEN ITS THREE FORMS: FIGHTER, GERWALK, AND BATTROID. TYPICALLY THE VALKYRIE WEAPON SHOOTS STRAIGHT AND QUICKLY, THE GERWALK WEAPON SHOOTS AROUND OR THROUGH OBSTACLES, AND THE BATTROID WEAPON DOES HIGHER DAMAGE IN EXCHANGE FOR REDUCED FIRING RATE. EACH WEAPON CAN BE UPGRADED UP TO TWICE BY PICKING UP POWER UP ITEMS DROPPED BY SPECIAL ENEMY SHIPS, BUT ONE LEVEL OF POWER UP WILL BE LOST ANY TIME THE VALKYRIE IS SHOT. IF A VALKYRIE'S ENTIRE LIFE BAR IS DEPLETED THEN THE FULL STAGE MUST BE REPEATED, PROVIDED THE PLAYER STILL HAS ENOUGH CONTINUES.

IN A NOD TO GALAGA THE PLAYER IS ABLE TO CAPTURE SOME ENEMY CRAFT TO INCREASE THEIR FIREPOWER. IF THE PLAYER DOES NOT SHOOT ANY WEAPONS FOR A FEW SECONDS A FIELD OF ELECTRICITY WILL COVER THE VALKYRIE. TOUCHING SOME ENEMY SHIPS WILL THEN CAUSE THEIR TARGETING TO BE SHORTED OUT AND MAKE THEM FRIENDLY TO THE PLAYER, FOLLOWING ALONG AND SHOOTING OR RAMMING ONSCREEN ENEMIES.</desc>

		<desc>COLUMNS IS LOOSELY DERIVED FROM TETRIS, AS IT INVOLVES ARRANGING FALLING BLOCKS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CLEAR THEM. HOWEVER, IN COLUMNS THEY ARE GROUPS OF 3 SAME-SIZE BUT VARYING COLOR BLOCKS, WHICH MUST BE ARRANGED INTO SEQUENCES OF 3 OR MORE, EITHER HORIZONTALLY, VERTICALLY OR DIAGONALLY. SEQUENCES OF 4 OR 5 COUNT FOR DOUBLE OR TRIPLE POINTS, AND DIAGONAL SEQUENCES SCORE THE MOST. THE REAL TRICK IS TO SET UP 'COMBOS' - WHERE ONE LINE CAUSES OTHER BLOCKS TO DROP SO AS TO CREATE OTHER LINES.

AS WELL AS THE NORMAL GAME MODE, THERE IS ALSO A 'FLASH' MODE, IN WHICH THE AIM IS SIMPLY TO REMOVE A PARTICULAR BLOCK FROM THE BASE OF THE PRE-FORMED PILE OF BRICKS. THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS CAN BE DETERMINED BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF COMPLETE ROWS WHICH ARE ALREADY IN PLACE.</desc>

BECAUSE THE STATUE IS NEEDED FOR SPRING TO COME, THE HEROES HYOU AND KIYU GO ON AN EXPEDITION TO RETURN THE STATUE TO ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE AND RESTORE ORDER ONCE MORE.
CORON LAND CONSISTS OF SHOOTING ENEMIES WITH THE RAY GUN, THROWING ENEMIES, AND THROWING PURPLE BALLS CALLED CORONS AT ENEMIES. CORONS CAN EITHER BE GENERATED FROM DOWNED ENEMIES (QUEST MODE) OR FROM RANDOM APPEARANCE (BATTLE MODE). ENEMIES ARE TURNED INTO CORONS AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HITS, BUT WILL RETURN TO THEIR FORMER FORMS IF NOT DEALT WITH AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME. ONCE AN ENEMY BECOMES A CORON, PLAYERS MAY EITHER CHOOSE TO IMMEDIATELY THROW THEM AS WEAPONS OR ROLL THEM TO MAKE THEM BECOME BIGGER AND CAUSE MORE HARM TO ENEMIES WHEN THROWN. THIS SNOWBALL EFFECT ALSO WORKS FOR CORONS THAT ARE RANDOMLY DROPPED.</desc>

		<name>Cu-On-Pa SFC</name>
		<desc>CU-ON-PA SFC IS THE SUPER FAMICOM VERSION OF CU-ON-PA.CU-ON-PA IS AN ORIGINAL PUZZLE GAME THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY A LITTLE-KNOWN GROUP CALLED ONESONG PARTNERS. THIS GROUP ORIGINALLY RELEASED AN OBSCURE GAME SIMILAR TO THIS BUT WITH A WIDER AUDIENCE IN MIND, VARIOUS ENHANCEMENTS AND ALTERNATE MODES FOR PCS CALLED "ENDORFUN" IN 1995 IN THE U.S AND EUROPE.JAPANESE DEVELOPERS SEEMED TO LIKE THE CONCEPT AND GOT PERMISSION TO MAKE SOMETHING LIKE IT BASED ON THE ORIGINAL PRINCIPALS OF ENDORFUN FOR THE OBSCURE SATELLAVIEW (OR BS-X) AND THEN LATER AS A STANDALONE RELEASE FOR THE SUPER FAMICOM, WHERE THE GAME WAS CALLED BS CU-ON-PA AND CU-ON-PA, RESPECTIVELY. IT WOULD ALSO GET RELEASED LATER FOR PLAYSTATION.PUBLISHED BY T&amp;E SOFT FOR THE SFC LATE IN 1996, CU-ON-PA WAS ALSO FAN-TRANSLATED SOMETIME LATER FOR THE EMULATION COMMUNITY, THOUGH THE GAME COMES WITH A RATHER STRAIGHTFORWARD TUTORIAL AND THE GAME IS VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND, BUT DIFFICULT TO MASTER. THIS GAME IS DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE AND IN A LEAGUE OF ITS OWN.YOU PLAY AS A THREE-DIMENSIONAL CUBE THAT MUST DESTROY ALL THE "LIFE PANELS" ON A LEVEL. TO DO SO, YOU HAVE TO ROTATE YOUR CUBE AND ROLL OVER THE COLORED SQUARES ON THE TRANSPARENT FIELD. PANELS COME IN A VARIETY OF COLORS AND THE MAIN WAY TO ELIMATE THEM IS BY HAVING THE COLOR ON THE TOP OF THE CUBE MATCH THE COLOR OF THE TILE BENEATH YOU.THE OTHER WAY IS FOR MORE SKILLED PLAYERS AND COMES IN THE FORM OF "LIGHTNING PANELS", WHICH ARE GENERATED WHEN YOU DESTROY PANELS OTHER THAN LIFE PANELS. DESTROY ENOUGH OF THEM AND YOU'LL HAVE LOTS OF THEM. THEN GO AND DESTROY A LIFE PANEL! WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS, ALL LIGHTNING PANELS WILL EXPLODE THAT MATCH THE COLOR OF THE LIFE PANEL YOU ROLLED OVER. MOREOVER, THE EXPLOSION SPREADS AND DETONATES OTHER TILES IN THE VICINITY, WHICH CAN SPREAD AND CREATE A CHAIN REACTION. IT'S UP TO YOU HOW YOU WISH TO RACK UP POINTS, EITHER BY TIME, CHAINS, OR BOTH.KEN KOJIMA WAS THE MUSIC COMPOSER.</desc>

		<name>Cyber Knight II : Chikyuu Teikoku no Yabou</name>
		<desc>FOLLOWING THE EVENTS OF THE FIRST CYBER KNIGHT IN THE 24TH CENTURY, THE CREW OF THE SWORDFISH HAVE RETURNED TO EARTH AFTER DEFEATING THE MECHANICAL "BERZERKERS" FAR ACROSS SPACE. HOWEVER DURING THEIR TIME AWAY, THE EARTH FEDERATION HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER BY THE AMBITIOUS GENERAL FORREST, WHO SEEKS TO WAGE WAR ON THE INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS AND CONQUER THEM. RECOGNIZING THE POTENTIAL WEAPONS THAT COULD BE MADE FROM THE BERZERKER SCIENCE DATA, FORREST IMPOUNDS THE SWORDFISH AND JAILS IT'S CREW. THE BERZERKER DATA IS USED TO CREATE "OVERTECH" AND BRING TO LIFE "METALLIFORMS", SELF-REPLICATING WAR MACHINES. THE SWORDFISH CREW MANAGES TO ESCAPE, THANKS TO A MYSTERIOUS AGENT "CJ", AND ARE RECRUITED INTO THE RESISTANCE AGAINST THE EARTH FEDERATION. GIVEN A NEW SPACESHIP, THE GALVODIRGE, THEY MUST TRAVEL THE GALAXY TO DIFFERENT HUMAN CIVILIZATIONS AND DEVISE A PLAN TO STOP EARTH'S ATTACK.

CYBER KNIGHT II IS AN RPG WITH SCIENCE-FICTION THEMES. AS IN THE FIRST GAME, MUCH OF THE GAME TAKES PLACE IN A TOP-DOWN VIEW FOR MOVEMENT ON PLANETS AND AREAS, A SIDE-VIEW FOR COMBAT SEQUENCES AND A FIRST PERSON MENU SYSTEM WHEN ABOARD THE GALVODIRGE STARSHIP. THE GALVODIRGE CAN TRAVEL BETWEEN STARS, SCANNING WORLDS FOR INFORMATION. IF THE SHIP IS ABLE TO LAND ON A PLANET, THE CREW CAN DEBARK EITHER ON FOOT OR USING COMBAT MODULES (MECHS). SOME AREAS ARE ONLY ACCESSIBLE USING MODULES AND OTHERS (SUCH AS TOWNS) DO NOT ALLOW THE USE OF THESE WAR MACHINES. MANY PLANETS WILL HAVE TOWNS OR PEOPLE LIVING ON THEM WHICH CAN BE TALKED TO IN ORDER TO UNCOVER INFORMATION. DIFFERENT QUESTS ARE ASSIGNED IN ORDER TO FIND THE ITEMS NECESSARY TO PROGRESS. THERE IS NO SYSTEM OF CURRENCY OR BUYING ITEMS. INSTEAD, MANY DEFEATED ENEMIES LEAVE BEHIND "NEOPARTS", WHICH CAN BE BROUGHT BACK TO THE SWORDFISH'S LAB. ANALYSIS OF THESE NEO PARTS UNLOCKS ENHANCES STATISTICS (ENDURANCE, AGILITY, ACCURACY, ETC) FOR THE MODULES AND NEW WEAPONS FOR THEM TO CARRY. 

THE CREW ARE DIVIDED INTO A THREE PERSON "COMBAT TEAM" AND A THREE PERSON "SUPPORT TEAM". IF MODULES ARE USED, THEY CAN BE ASSIGNED FROM THE SHIP'S HANGER. UNLIKE THE FIRST GAME, MODULES ONLY PERFORM A COMBAT OR A SUPPORT ROLE, AND EACH IS UNIQUE IN STATISTICS AND THE TYPE OF WEAPONRY IT CAN CARRY. WHEN COMBAT OCCURS ON THE MAIN MAP, THE SUPPORT TEAM WILL OFTEN DELIVER THE FIRST STRIKE BY FIRING MISSILES INTO THE ENEMIES. WHEN SEARCHING FACILITIES, CAVES OR OTHER LOCATIONS, THE SUPPORT TEAM IS NOT AVAILABLE. FOLLOWING EITHER CASE, THE COMBAT TEAM ENGAGES THE ENEMY IN TURN-BASED COMBAT ON A 6X6 SQUARES FIELD. SEEN FROM THE SIDE VIEW, THE THREE MODULES CAN BE POSITIONED IN RELATION TO ENEMIES IN ORDER TO ATTACK, USING A VARIETY OF MELEE AND LONG-RANGED WEAPONRY. AMMUNITION IS UNLIMITED, BUT EACH MODULE ALSO CARRIES A NUMBER OF "OPTIONS" THAT ARE CONSUMABLE ATTACKS. EACH MODULE HAS TWO SETS OF HITPOINTS: ONE FOR THE PILOT AND ONE FOR THE MODULE ITSELF. IF EITHER ONE OF THESE REACHES ZERO, THE MODULE IS DESTROYED. IN ORDER TO HEAL, THE PARTY CARRIES 10 EACH OF REPAIR KITS AND FIRST AID KITS, WHICH MUST WHEN NOT IN COMBAT. THESE KITS, AS WELL AS OPTIONS AND DEFEATED PILOTS OR MODULES CAN BE RESTORED BY RETURNING TO THE GALVODIRGE.</desc>

IN DESPERATION, THE CREW ACTIVATE THEIR JUMP DRIVE WITHOUT A DESTINATION... AND END UP FLUNG ACROSS THE GALAXY TO THE GALACTIC CORE. THE SWORDFISH HOWEVER IS BADLY DAMAGED WITH MANY CASUALTIES INCLUDING THE CAPTAIN. ONLY 26 OF THE CREW SURVIVE, AND OF THEM ONLY 6 ARE QUALIFIED FOR COMBAT: THE COMMANDER, TWO SOLDIERS, A MECHANIC AND A DOCTOR AND SIX GIANT "MODULE" MECHANIZED SUITS AVAILABLE FOR THEM. THESE SURVIVORS LOCATE PLANET FARWORLD, APPARENTLY COLONIZED BY HUMANS. THERE THEY DISCOVER THE COLONY IS UNDER ATTACK BY A RELENTLESS MECHANICAL ALIENS DUBBED "BERSERKERS". THE CREW OF THE SWORDFISH MUST FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE BERSERKERS AND EXPLORE THE GALAXY FOR SOME MEANS TO RETURN HOME.

CYBER KNIGHT IS AN RPG WITH A SCIENCE-FICTION THEME OF BEING LOST IN AN ALIEN GALAXY.

		<desc>NINE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE TURNED INTO CYBORGS BY A COMPANY TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD. THEY HAVE DEFEATED THIS COMPANY AND ARE NOW USING THEIR SUPER POWERS TO PROTECT THE WORLD.

BASED ON THE MANGA/ANIME BY THE SAME NAME, CYBORG 009 IS A SIDE-SCROLLING PLATFORMER IN WHICH THE PLAYER TAKES CONTROL OF 8 DIFFERENT CYBORGS, USING THEIR SPECIAL ABILITIES TO COMPLETE SEVERAL MISSIONS. 

THEIR SPECIAL ABILITIES ARE AS FOLLOWS:
002 CAN FLY AND HOVER IN THE AIR; 003 CAN SEE IN THE DARK; 004 CAN FIRE BULLETS FROM HIS FINGERS AND ROCKETS FROM HIS KNEES; 005 CAN BREAK ROCKS WITH HIS FISTS; 006 CAN BLOW FIRE THAT ALSO MELTS ROCKS; 007 CAN TAKE ON DIFFERENT SHAPES INCLUDING THOSE OF ENEMIES; 008 CAN SWIM UNDERWATER FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME; 009 CAN MOVE AT VERY HIGH SPEEDS. (001 IS A BABY AND CAN'T BE TAKEN ON MISSIONS). USING THESE SPECIAL ABILITIES CONSUMES SP THAT SLOWLY REGENERATE. 

IN ADDITION TO THEIR SPECIAL ABILITIES, THE CYBORGS ALSO HAVE FOUR ATTRIBUTES THAT GOVERN THEIR ATTACK AND DEFENSIVE POWERS, THEIR AMOUNT OF SP AND SP REGENERATION SPEED. 

BEFORE EVERY MISSION, ONE CYBORG IS ASSIGNED LEADER AND TWO MORE CAN BE SELECTED BY THE PLAYER. ONLY ONE CYBORG CAN BE CONTROLLED AT A TIME, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO SWITCH BETWEEN CYBORGS AT ANY TIME.

		<desc>THROUGH THE LIGHT CAME THE DARKNESS, AND THROUGH THE DARKNESS CAME THE LIGHT. THEY WERE INSEPARABLE IN THE BEGINNING, AND GAVE BIRTH TO EACH OTHER. RUKYU APPEARED BEFORE ALL THE OTHER CREATURES, THE GREAT DEMON OF DARKNESS, LATER TO BE KNOWN AS THE SATAN. THE DIVINE HERO-GOD RODA WENT UP TO HIS DARK REALM TO DEFEAT HIM, BUT WAS STRUCK DOWN, AND PRESUMED DEAD. BUT THE HERO COULDN'T DIE SO EASILY: HE SWORE TO DEFEAT RUKYU ONCE AND FOR ALL. MEANWHILE, RUKYU DOESN'T JUST STAY IN HIS REALM, WAITING FOR RODA: HE GOES OUT TO THE WORLD AS A DEATH-BRINGING SORCERER, AND HE IS OUT FOR RODA...

THE GAME IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM MOST OTHER RPGS, BECAUSE IT LETS YOU PLAY AS BOTH THE "GOOD" HERO AND THE VILLAIN. THE GAME IS DIVIDED INTO CHAPTERS, AND EACH CHAPTER IS PLAYED BY EITHER RODA OR RUKYU. YOU SWITCH THE TWO HEROES CHAPTER-AFTER-CHAPTER, AND LEAD THEM TO THEIR ULTIMATE BATTLE FROM TWO OPPOSITE SIDES. THE ENTIRE GAME, INCLUDING THE BATTLES, IS VIEWED FROM AN ISOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE. THE BATTLES ARE RANDOM AND TURN-BASED, AND THE BATTLE FIELD IS DIVIDED INTO SQUARES YOU CAN POSITION AND MOVE YOUR CHARACTERS ON. BOTH RODA AND RUKYU CAN HAVE PARTY MEMBERS JOIN THEM, AND BOTH ATTACK MOSTLY WITH MAGIC. RUKYU USES A SPECIAL ENERGY CALLED "SOUL POWER", WHILE RODA CAST ONE-TIME SPELLS FROM SCROLLS HE RECEIVES AFTER BATTLES.</desc>

		<name>Dark Law : Meaning of Death</name>
		<desc>THREE-HUNDRED YEARS AGO, THERE WERE TWO KINGDOMS ON THE EARTH -REYFORE, RULED BY THE BENEVOLENT AND MIGHTY KING REYNARD, AND AMUGNON, RULED BY KING DARUK. THE TWO KINGDOMS COULD HAVE LIVED IN PEACE, BUT PRIDE TOOK OVER KING DARUK, HE DIDN'T RESPECT THE GODDESS ANY MORE, AND AS A RESULT HIS MIND BECAME OBSESSED BY THE IDEA OF DESTRUCTION. DARUK ATTACKED REYFORE, AND FOR DECADES WAR WAS EMBRACING THE TWO KINGDOMS, SETTING THE EARTH IN FLAMES. AFTER A PROLONGED BATTLE, KING REYNARD DEFEATED KING DARUK, AND A REIGN OF PROSPERITY BEGAN ONCE AGAIN.

BUT CAN EVIL BE TRULY DEFEATED? THE HERO OF THE GAME, A YOUNG ADVENTURER, FALLS DOWN FROM A CLIFF WHILE TAKING A STROLL NEAR THE ANCIENT SOPHIA TEMPLE. HE IS SAVED BY AN OLD MAN WHO LIVES WITH HIS DAUGHTER REFIA IN A SMALL COUNTRY HOUSE. BUT ONE DAY, A DEMONIC-LOOKING KNIGHT APPEARS, ACCOMPANIED BY MONSTERS, KILLS THE OLD MAN, AND KIDNAPS REFIA. THE OLD MAN RECOGNIZED THE KNIGHT - IT WAS KING DARUK! NOW THE HERO MUST BRING REFIA BACK AND DEFEAT DARUK ONCE AND FOR ALL.

THE GAME HAS A LESS LINEAR STRUCTURE THAN A STANDARD CONSOLE-STYLE RPG: TOGETHER WITH THE MAIN STORY THERE ARE MANY MISSIONS, OR "SCENARIOS", WHICH ARE NOT OBLIGATORY TO COMPLETE, BUT WHICH OCCUPY A LARGE PORTION OF THE GAME. IN THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME YOU CREATE A PARTY OF FOUR CHARACTERS, THE HERO AND HIS THREE COMPANIONS. THE BATTLES ARE PRE-DETERMINED AND TAKE PLACE ON THE SAME SCREEN AS THE GAMEWORLD ITSELF. YOUR PARTY AND THE ENEMIES CAN MOVE FREELY AROUND THE SCREEN AND ATTACK WITH MELEE AND RANGED WEAPONS, AND THEIR ACTIONS DEPEND ON THE AMOUNT OF ACTION POINTS THEY HAVE. NAVIGATION IN TOWN IS MENU-BASED.</desc>

THE GAME FEATURES A "DRAMATIC" PERSPECTIVE THAT IS ALSO SLIGHTLY TURN-BASED, SIMILAR TO THE CAPTAIN TSUBASA GAMES. A WINDOW DEMONSTRATES WHAT IS HAPPENING - A BALL IS PASSED, A SHOT IS THROWN, THE TIP-OFF - IN DRAMATIC COMIC BOOK STYLE THAT IS REMINISCENT OF THE MANGA. WHILE A PLAYER'S ATHLETE HAS THE BALL, THE PLAYER CAN PULL UP A MENU THAT ALLOWS THEM TO CHOOSE TO PASS, SHOOT OR LOOK AT THE PRESENT CHARACTERS STATS - EACH CHARACTER HAS THEIR OWN STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES THAT THE PLAYER SHOULD KEEP IN MIND.</desc>

WHILE THE ORIGINAL VERSION PROVIDES THE SAME GAMEPLAY AS THE SUPER FAMICOM VERSION TESTED HERE, THE GAME DOES HAVE SOME NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCES. FIRST OF ALL, IT HAS MORE ENEMIES AND FEATURES COLORFUL BACKGROUNDS BORROWED FROM TRADITIONAL JAPANESE THEMES AND MYTHS (WELL, IN THE KOREAN VERSION OF THE GAME, METRO3D APPARENTLY THREW IN A COUPLE OF BIKINI GIRLS FOR GOOD MEASURE). ADDITIONALLY, THE ARCADE GAME ONLY CONTAINS A STORY MODE AND THERE IS NO PROGRESS MAP OR ALTERNATE GAME MODES LIKE IN THE SUPER FAMICOM PORT. BUT, MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE GAMEPLAY IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT - THE PLAYER HAS TO MOVE THE CHARACTER AROUND THE SCREEN IN ORDER TO HIT A BLOCK WITH THE MALLET. THE SUPER FAMICON VERSION, ON THE CONTRARY, AUTOMATICALLY ALIGNS THE PLAYER WITH THE FURTHEST MOST BLOCK, AND THIS APPARENTLY MINOR DIFFERENCE MAKES THE GAMEPLAY OF THE HOME CONVERSION MORE FAST-PACED AND ENJOYABLE THAN THE ORIGINAL.</desc>

THIS MEANS THAT PLAYERS DO NOT ONLY HAVE TO KEEP THEIR GAME AREA CLEAR, BUT ALSO PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR CHARACTERS HEALTH BAR. ONCE A BLOCK TOUCHES THE TOP OF THE SCREEN OR THE HEALTH BAR IS DIMINISHED THE GAME ENDS.

THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT ICONS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS WHEN COMBINED:
BOOKS, SWORDS AND ROCKS DEAL DAMAGE TO AN OPPONENT BY ATTACKING WITH FIREBALLS, DRAGONS OR SWORDS.
BOTTLES HEAL A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HEALTH.
PURPLE BLOCKS HAVE NO EFFECT, BUT CLOG UP THE SCREEN NONETHELESS.

CHAIN REACTIONS RESULT IN PARTICULARLY POWERFUL ATTACKS OR PLACE ONE OR MORE GREY BLOCKS INSIDE THE OPPONENTS AREA. THEY CAN BE DESTROYED JUST LIKE ORDINARY BLOCKS, BUT THEY ALWAYS STAY IN THE SAME SPOT AND DO NOT FALL DOWN.

MORE COMPLEX CHAIN REACTIONS GIVE ACCESS TO SPECIAL ATTACKS, UP TO THREE OF WHICH CAN BE HELD AND ACTIVATED WITH THE SHOULDER BUTTONS. SPECIAL ATTACKS HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS THAT INCLUDE CLEARING ALL PURPLE BLOCKS, USING ALL POTIONS AND CLEARING THE BOTTOM THREE LINES.</desc>

BUT TO THE AMAZEMENT OF THE HERO SON GOKU AND HIS FRIENDS, THEIR ARCHRIVAL PICCOLO APPEARS DURING THE TOURNAMENT, SO THAT IT QUICKLY TURNS INTO A GENUINE BATTLE.

YOU CONTROL SON GOKU AND HIS SON SON GOHAN, SWITCHING BETWEEN THEM AS THE GAME PROGRESSES. THE GAME IS BASICALLY AN INTERACTIVE COMIC BOOK IN WHICH YOU CAN INFLUENCE THE STORY BY CHOOSING TO PRESS A BUTTON WHEN THE GAME PROMPTS YOU TO MAKE A CHOICE. YOU'LL ALSO PARTICIPATE IN BATTLES. THE BATTLE SYSTEM IS SIMILAR TO ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS GAME, WHERE ONE KIND OF MOVE ALWAYS BEATS OR ALWAYS LOSES TO ANOTHER. YOU CAN DASH INTO YOUR ENEMIES, ATTACK PHYSICALLY, AND PERFORM SPECIAL MOVES, PRESSING THE BUTTONS IN REAL TIME (ALTHOUGH THE BATTLES ARE DIVIDED INTO TURNS).</desc>

		<name>Dragon Quest III : Soshite Densetsu e...</name>
		<desc>DRAGON WARRIOR III IS THE CONCLUDING GAME OF THE FIRST DRAGON QUEST/DRAGON WARRIOR TRILOGY, AND ITS STORY TAKES US BACK TO THE TIME PERIOD OF THE LEGENDARY ERDRICK (ALSO KNOWN AS LOTO), THE ANCESTOR OF THE FIRST GAME'S HERO. YOU ARE THE SON OF A POWERFUL WARRIOR ORTEGA, SKILLFUL IN PHYSICAL COMBAT AND SPELLCASTING. YOUR FATHER WENT OUT TO FIGHT THE EVIL BARAMOS, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE APPEARANCE OF MONSTERS IN YOUR REGION, AND NEVER RETURNED. YOU ARE SENT BY THE KING ON A QUEST TO CONTINUE YOUR FATHER'S BRAVE DEEDS AND TO DEFEAT BARAMOS.

DRAGON WARRIOR III IS A TOP-DOWN ROLE-PLAYING GAME WHERE YOU TRAVEL AROUND THE OVERWORLD, CAVES, CASTLES, CITIES AND OTHER LOCATIONS WHILE BATTLING RANDOM ENCOUNTERS, BUYING EQUIPMENT, AND TALKING TO PEOPLE. YOU AND YOUR PARTY MEMBERS RECEIVE EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY BEAT UP MONSTERS AND LEVEL UP WITH ENOUGH EXPERIENCE, INCREASING THEIR STATS. THE GAME FEATURES A DAY/NIGHT CYCLE - AS YOU TRAVEL, DAY SLOWLY CHANGES TO NIGHT AND VICE VERSA; SHOPS ARE TYPICALLY CLOSED AT NIGHT. 

YOU BEGIN WITH CONTROL OF JUST THE MAIN CHARACTER BUT CAN QUICKLY RECRUIT THREE MORE MEMBERS TO YOUR PARTY. DURING THE GAME YOU CAN CHOOSE TO DROP YOUR CURRENT CHARACTERS AND RECRUIT OTHERS AT ANY TIME. THE RECRUITABLE CHARACTERS ARE DIVIDED INTO SIX CLASSES: SOLDIER, FIGHTER, MERCHANT, GOOF-OFF, PILGRIM AND WIZARD.

THE GAME HAS A UNIQUE JOB SYSTEM, GIVING YOU THE ABILITY TO SWITCH YOUR HIRED CHARACTERS' CLASSES AFTER THEY HAVE ACHIEVED AT LEAST LEVEL 20 IN THEIR BASE CLASS. CHARACTERS CAN SWITCH TO THE OTHER BEGINNING CLASSES, AS WELL AS THE SAGE CLASS, WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THE BEGINNING. WHEN A CHARACTER SWITCHES CLASSES, THEY LOSE ALL EARNED EXPERIENCE POINTS, AND HALF OF THEIR STATS, BUT RETAIN ALL OF THE ABILITIES OF THE PREVIOUS CLASS. IN THIS WAY, YOU CAN CREATE POWERFUL COMBINATION CHARACTERS THAT ARE ABLE TO CAST SPELLS AND FIGHT EFFECTIVELY.</desc>

		<desc>A YOUNG BOY HAS A STRANGE DREAM EVERY NIGHT, WHERE A VOICE CALLS HIM. IN THIS DREAM THERE'S A MAGICAL KINGDOM CALLED ENDERIA. THE QUEEN OF ENDERIA AND HER DAUGHTERS WERE KIDNAPPED BY THE DEMON AKUMA, WHO NOW REIGNS SUPREME. THE BOY MUST ENTER THE DREAMWORLD, DEFEAT THE DEMON AND RESCUE THE NOBILITY.

YUME MEIKY?: KIGURUMI DAIB?KEN IS A FIRST-PERSON DUNGEON CRAWLER WITH STEP-MOVEMENT AND RANDOM ENCOUNTERS THAT PLAYS LIKE A SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF THE DUNGEON MASTER SERIES TEMPLATE, ALBEIT WITH A TURN-BASED ENGINE. ONE OF THE MAIN DIFFERENCES IS THE PRESENTATION: INSTEAD OF THE USUAL DANK AND DARK DUNGEON WITH GRIM WALLS COVERED BY RUSTY CHAINS, THIS GAME HAS SURFACES MADE OF CAKE AND CANDY. INSTEAD OF SKELETONS AND ORCS AS ENEMIES, IT FEATURES FURRY AND CUTE ANTHROPOMORPHIC ANIMALS. ONCE DEFEATED, THESE CREATURES OCCASIONALLY LEAVE BEHIND THEIR SKIN, WHICH THE HERO CAN COLLECT AND WEAR FOR A CHANGE IN STATISTICS AND NEW ABILITIES. THEY ALSO SOMETIMES DROP CANDY, THE GAME'S CURRENCY. THERE ARE SEVERAL SHOPS ON EACH LEVEL: A TAILOR SHOP TO CHANGE AND STORE SKINS (IT IS POSSIBLE TO CARRY A MAXIMUM OF SIX SKINS), SHOPS FOR POTIONS AND HEALTH BOOSTS, ETC.

WHEN A RANDOM ENEMY ENCOUNTER OCCURS, A MENU WITH THE OPTIONS OF FIGHTING OR ESCAPING APPEARS. AFTER CHOOSING TO FIGHT, ANOTHER MENU POPS UP, WHICH INCLUDES THE COMMANDS PUNCH, KICK, TALENT, DEFEND, AND ITEM. AFTER CHOOSING EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO THE PLAYER IS PRESENTED WITH A GRID WHERE AN ICON (A FIST OR A FOOT) CAN BE POSITIONED OVER A PART OF THE ENEMY BODY. THIS PROVIDES A STRATEGIC ELEMENT TO THE GAME, AS DIFFERENT ENEMIES HAVE DIFFERENT WEAK SPOTS THAT CAN BE EXPLOITED. THE TALENT OPTION ACCESSES THE SPECIAL ABILITY THAT A SKIN MAY POSSESS.</desc>

		<name>Feda : The Emblem of Justice</name>
		<desc>IN A FANTASY WORLD, A SOLDIER FROM THE IMPERIAL FORCES DESERTS AFTER WITNESSING THE MASSACRE OF INNOCENT VILLAGERS BY HIS UNIT. HE IS SENT TO JAIL TO BE EXECUTED, BUT MANAGES TO ESCAPE WITH THE HELP OF TWO FORMER UNIT COLLEAGUES. THE GROUP FLEES THROUGH THE COUNTRY-SIDE, WHILE BEING PURSUED BY IMPERIAL SOLDIERS. ON THEIR WAY, THEY JOIN FORCES WITH OTHER REBELS TO FIGHT AGAINST THE ENEMY, WHILE UNCOVERING HIDDEN SECRETS AND EVIL PLOTS BY THE EMPIRE.

FEDA: EMBLEM OF JUSTICE IS A STRATEGY RPG SIMILAR TO SHINING FORCE AND OTHER TITLES WITH PRESET CHARACTERS AND LINEAR GAMEPLAY. THE PLAYER COMMANDS A PARTY OF VARYING SIZE AND CHARACTERS WITH DIVERSE SKILLS.

IN THE MAIN BATTLE SECTIONS, THE PLAYER AND THE CPU-CONTROLLED ENEMY TAKE TURNS MOVING THE TROOPS AND GIVING ORDERS. A MENU AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN SHOWS ALL THE POSSIBLE ACTIONS, WHERE SOLDIERS CAN DEFEND, MOVE, ATTACK, OR USE AN INVENTORY ITEM ON EACH TURN. THE RANGE OF THEIR MOVEMENTS AND WEAPONS VARY ACCORDING TO THEIR NATURE. A CROSSBOW CHARACTER CAN SHOOT FROM THE BACK, WHILE MOST SWORD AND KNIFE USERS HAVE TO BE ADJACENT TO THEIR TARGETS. MAGIC OFFENSIVE POWERS HAVE DIFFERENT RANGES AS WELL, REACHING ENEMIES THAT ARE FAR AWAY FROM THE ATTACKING CHARACTER. HEALTH POINTS CAN BE RECOVERED BY EATING RATIONS OR BY MAGIC, WHERE A HEALER CAN RESTORE POINTS TO SEVERAL CHARACTERS AT ONCE.

EACH PARTY MEMBER HAS SEPARATE HEALTH AND MAGIC POINTS, AS WELL AS OTHER STATISTICS LIKE DEFENSE AND ATTACK POWER. THEY RECEIVE EXPERIENCE POINTS AFTER SLAYING AN ENEMY OR CASTING A SPELL, AND EXTRA POINTS AT THE END OF THE BATTLE. THEIR SKILLS INCREASE AFTER SURPASSING 100 POINTS.

THE MAP SCREEN SHOWS THE PARTY AND GROUPS OF ENEMIES TRAVELING THROUGH THE LANDSCAPE IN TURNS. THE MENU HAS OPTIONS FOR MOVING THE GROUP OR CAMPING. IN THE ENCAMPMENT, ONE OF THE CHARACTERS AROUND THE FIRE PIT SAVES THE GAME, WHILE ANOTHER INSIDE THE TENT PROVIDES SYSTEM OPTIONS TO CHANGE THE INTERFACE COLOR, ADJUST SOUND VOLUME AND RENAME THE PARTY MEMBERS.

IN SOME LOCATIONS LIKE TEMPLES, VILLAGES AND TOWNS, THE PARTY HAS TO EXPLORE THE PLACE AND TALK TO THE CITIZENS TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SECTION. IN LATER BATTLES, THE PLAYER HAS TO MAKE A MORAL CHOICE ABOUT ATTACKING MUTATED HUMANS. AT THE END OF EACH BATTLE, THE PARTY IS ASSIGNED A DARK OR LIGHT EMBLEM, AND CERTAIN PARTY MEMBERS CHOOSE TO LEAVE OR STAY IN THE GROUP BASED ON ITS ALIGNMENT.</desc>

THE GAME FEATURES MULTIPLE MODES. THE MAIN STORY MODE INVOLVES MIZOGUCHI CHASING DOWN A MYSTERIOUS MASKED CHARACTER AFTER HE DISPARAGES OSAKA'S TAKOYAKI, OF WHICH MIZOGUCHI IS FIERCELY PROTECTIVE. MIZOGUCHI THEN TRAVELS AROUND JAPAN IN PURSUIT, FIGHTING THE OTHER CHARACTERS FOR VARIOUS CONTRIVED REASONS. THERE'S ALSO A CPU BATTLE MODE IN WHICH THE PLAYER PROGRESSES THROUGH A MORE TRADITIONAL "ARCADE" MODE WITH ANY CHARACTER THEY WISH. THERE'S ALSO THE STANDARD VERSUS MODE FOR UP TO TWO PLAYERS.

IN ADDITION, THE GAME HAS A SURVIVAL MODE (SURVIVE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AGAINST AN ENDLESS STRING OF OPPONENTS), A TAG MODE (EITHER COMBATANT CAN HOVER AROUND THE EDGE OF THE SCREEN TO SWITCH TO A SECOND CHARACTER) AND A PRACTICE MODE.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy IV</name>
		<desc>THIS IS THE FOURTH ENTRY IN THE  FINAL FANTASY SERIES. IT WAS KNOWN AS FINAL FANTASY II INTERNATIONALLY, BECAUSE THE  SECOND AND THIRD GAMES WERE NEVER RELEASED OUTSIDE OF JAPAN.

THE MILITARY COUNTRY OF BARON IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST IN THE LAND, WITH A PROUD ARMY AND A MAJESTIC AIR FORCE KNOWN AS THE RED WINGS. BUT, WHILE THEIR ARMIES ARE KIND AND LOYAL, THE RECENT ACTIONS OF THE KING ARE ANYTHING BUT. THE YOUNG CAPTAIN OF THE RED WINGS, CECIL, IS ORDERED TO STEAL A CRYSTAL FROM A VILLAGE OF INNOCENT MAGICIANS, AND WHEN HE QUESTIONS THE ACTIONS OF HIS KING, CECIL IS IMMEDIATELY THROWN OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND SENT OFF TO KILL STRANGE MONSTERS. LITTLE DOES HE REALIZE THE PRICE THE KING'S ACTIONS WILL PAY, AND WHAT THE TRUE SECRET OF THE CRYSTALS, AND THEIR POWERS, TRULY IS...

THIS IS THE FIRST FINAL FANTASY GAME THAT INTRODUCED THE FAMOUS ATB (ACTIVE-TIME BATTLE) SYSTEM: DURING THE BATTLES, YOU HAVE A TIME INDICATOR FOR EACH PARTY MEMBER THAT TELLS YOU WHEN THIS CHARACTER IS ABLE TO ACT. IF IT TAKES YOU TOO LONG TO SELECT A COMMAND FOR THIS CHARACTER, THE ENEMY WILL ACT WITHOUT WAITING FOR YOUR TURN. THE GAME ABANDONS THE JOB SYSTEM THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN THE  FIRST AND THE  THIRD GAME IN FAVOR OF PRE-SET CHARACTER CLASSES (PALADIN, WHITE MAGE, NINJA, ETC.) ASSIGNED TO EACH PARTY MEMBER.

THE PLAYSTATION VERSION ADDS A NEW RENDERED INTRO AND ENDING.</desc>

THE GAME IS ESSENTIALLY AN ARCADE SPORTS TITLE BASKETBALL BASICALLY. THE MAIN SCREEN THERE WILL BE LITTLE CHOICE GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF ONLY THREE MODES: STORY MODE AND CLASSIC FRIENDLY TOURNAMENT. IN THE FIRST WE FOLLOW THE EVENTS OF THE TELEVISION SERIES WHOSE PLOT DIFFERS SLIGHTLY FROM THE ORIGINAL ONE: USING SHOHOKU THEN WE WILL QUALIFY FOR THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP. THE SECOND AND THIRD BUT I THINK THERE IS A NEED FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION.

EXECUTABLE FIELD OPERATIONS WOULD ALSO BE DIFFERENT, YOU CAN ALSO FEINT SHOTS AND BLOW UP THEIR OPPONENTS MARKERS. THEN SUCCESSFULLY ACCUMULATING A SEQUENCE OF 'AFFIRMATIVE ACTION' ROW (STEPS SUCCEEDED, BASKETS MADE OR AVOIDED), WILL FILL A HORIZONTAL BAR AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN AND, AS HE DID A LITTLE 'IN THE PLAYROOM WITH THE SNK STREET HOOP, PRESSING SIMULTANEOUSLY THE THREE KEYS WILL NOT DORSAL (EXCEPT B), YOU CAN MAKE A SUPER NICE SHOOTING WITH SUPPLEMENTAL ANIMATIONS DEPENDING ON THE PLAYER USED.</desc>

		<name>Front Mission (Trans.)</name>
		<desc>IN THE FUTURE, MANY MILITARY FORCES ARE DEPENDENT ON HUGE MECH ROBOTS, CALLED WANZERS (WALKING PANZERS) FOR COMBAT. AT HUFFMAN ISLAND, LOCATED IN THE THE PACIFIC OCEAN, WANZERS ARE DEPLOYED BY BOTH THE USN (UNITED STATES OF THE NEW CONTINENT) AND THE OCU (OCEANA COMMUNITY UNION), WHO DISPUTE OWNERSHIP OVER THE ISLAND.  ONE NIGHT, THE OCU FORCES STAGE A COVERT RECON MISSION ON A FACILITY LOCATED IN LARCUS, A USN-HELD TERRITORY AND WEAPONS FACILITY. LEAD BY A SOLDIER NAMED ROID, THIS MISSION WAS ENTIRELY UNOFFICIAL AND VIOLATED THE PEACE TREATY. DURING THE MISSION, USN FORCES LEAD BY COMMANDER DRISCOLL APPEARED AND AMBUSHED THE OCU SOLDIERS. DURING THE COMBAT, ROID'S FIANCE, KAREN IS KILLED AND THE USN FACILITY IS BLOWN UP; PLACING THE BLAME ON THE OCU. THIS BECAME KNOWN AS THE "LARCUS INCIDENT" AND THE OCU DENIED ALL KNOWLEDGE OF IT'S SOLDIERS ACTIONS. ULTIMATELY IT WOULD BE A LEADING CAUSE TO THE SECOND HUFFMAN WAR. 

ONE YEAR LATER, THE WAR IS UNDERWAY AND HUFFMAN ISLAND IS UNDER PROVISIONAL CONTROL OF THE OCU, BUT WITH A WEAKENED MILITARY UNABLE TO DEFEND AGAINST USN ATTACKS. THE SOLDIERS INVOLVED INVOLVED IN THE LARCUS INCIDENT HAVE ALL BEEN DISCHARGED AND DISGRACED. ROID SPENDS HIS TIME FIGHTING AS A GLADIATOR IN THE WANZER FIGHTING ARENA BEFORE BEING APPROACHED BY A MYSTERIOUS MAN. COLONEL OLSON HAS FOUND OUT ABOUT ROID'S HISTORY AND WANTS HIM TO COMMAND A MERCENARY UNIT HE IS ASSEMBLING ON BEHALF OF THE OCU, DUBBED "CARRION CROW". CONVINCING ROID THAT DRISCOLL IS STILL OUT THERE ON THE ISLAND, ROID AGREES.

FRONT MISSION IS A TURN-BASED STRATEGY RPG PLAYED FROM AN ISOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE. PLAYERS PROGRESS IN THE STORY THROUGH LARGE STRATEGIC BATTLES INVOLVING MULTIPLE UNITS AND CUTSCENES BETWEEN THEM. AT CERTAIN PLACES, USUALLY TOWNS, THE PLAYER CAN VISIT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS INCLUDING BARS AND SHOPS, AND TALK TO PEOPLE. SHOPS ARE ALSO FOUND TO PURCHASE NEW WEAPONRY, PARTS AND MAKE REPAIRS. IN COMBAT, EACH WANZER ROBOT IS A SEPERATE UNIT AND, HAS A LARGE VARIETY OF WEAPONS AND ATTACK STYLES DEPENDING ON WHAT'S EQUIPPED. UNITS GET EXPERIENCE FOR DEFEATING ENEMIES AND ALSO FOR USING VARIOUS TECHNIQUES. THE MORE AN ATTACK IS USED, THE MORE POWERFUL IT BECOMES.</desc>

		<desc>THE YEAR IS 2064, WHEN THE GREAT SOLAR POWER SATELLITE, ATLAS IS OVERSHADOWED BY THE INVENTION OF FUSION POWER. THE GOVERNMENT ALLIANCE THAT HAD SUPPORTED THE BUILDING OF ATLAS NOW FIND THEMSELVES FACING ECONOMIC CRISIS AS THE BALANCE OF POWER SHIFTS. IN THIS WORLD OF CONFLICT AND CHANGE, THE WALKING PANZER, OR WANZER, (A FORM OF MECHA) BECOMES THE STANDARD ARMORED UNIT FOR WARS AND PETTY BATTLES ACROSS THE GLOBE. FOR THE SMALL NATION OF BERGEN, A COUP D'ETAT IS UNDERWAY, STAGED BY COLONEL ARK. SEEKING TO ESTABLISH COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE GOVERNMENT AND THE NORAD UNITS STATIONED THERE, ARK'S FIRST STEP INVOLVES THE CAPTURE OF PRESIDENT ORWEN. TIPPED OFF TO THE REBELLION, ORWEN SEEKS TO FLEE FROM BERGEN, LOOKING FOR SAFE PASSAGE OUT OF THE SEAPORT OF PORT ERTOTHAL. A YOUNG WANZER PILOT, ALBERT GRABNER, IS ASSIGNED ESCORT DUTY TO THE PRESIDENT BY LOYAL ELEMENTS OF THE ARMY STATIONED THERE...

GUN HAZARD IS A SIDE-SCROLLING VERSION OF THE FRONT MISSION SERIES. GAMEPLAY IS MORE THAN A LITTLE SIMILAR TO CYBERNATOR OR METAL WARRIORS. THE PLAYER MOVES BETWEEN DIFFERENT STAGES ON AN AREA MAP. ONCE INSIDE A LEVEL, THE PLAYER CONTROLS ALBERT AND HIS WANZER AS IT MOVES LEFT, RIGHT ACROSS THE SCREEN. THE WANZER IS ABLE TO JUMP, AND ATTACK WITH A PRIMARY AND A SPECIAL WEAPON. AT ANY TIME DURING A LEVEL, ALBERT CAN EJECT FROM HIS HEAVILY ARMED WANZER TO EXPLORE. ALTHOUGH VULNERABLE WHEN OUTSIDE, ALBERT IS ABLE TO REACH AREAS THE WANZER CANNOT, IN ADDITION TO BEING A SMALLER TARGET AND BEING ABLE TO JETPACK INDEFINITELY.

ADDITIONALLY, ALBERT CAN RECRUIT OTHER CHARACTERS THROUGH THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE STORY, SOME OF WHOM CAN BE DESIGNATED TO SUPPORT ROLES. THESE SUPPORT CHARACTERS WHEN SET CAN PROVIDE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT COVER FIRE ABILITIES FOR ALBERT DURING HIS MISSIONS. THEY TOO GAIN EXPERIENCE AND LEVELS. DIFFERENT WEAPONS AND ARMOR CAN BE FOUND OR BOUGHT. ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS INCLUDE THE BOOSTER ABILITY WHICH ALLOWS THE WANZER TO HOVER AND INCREASE IT'S JUMPS, AS WELL AS THE DASH ABILITY WHICH ALLOWS QUICK LEFT-RIGHT MOVEMENT BY THE WANZER. MONEY AND EXPERIENCE ARE EARNED THROUGH THE COMPLETION OF LEVEL OBJECTIVES AS WELL AS THE KILL COUNT OF ENEMY WANZERS.</desc>

		<desc>HOME VERSION OF THE 1979 ARCADE GAME OF THE SAME NAME. THE AIM IS TO LAUNCH MISSILES FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AT ENEMY SPACECRAFT LOCATED AT THE TOP. TO GET THERE, THE MISSILE MUST PASS THROUGH A ASTEROID BELT FLYING ACROSS THE SCREEN AND AVOID THE SHOTS BEING FIRED DOWN FROM THE SPACECRAFT. IT IS THE PLAYERS JOB TO CONTROL THE MISSILE. ONCE LAUNCHED IT CAN BE MOVED LEFT AND RIGHT AND CAN BE SPED UP BY USING THE BOOST TO SPEED IT'S WAY OUT OF TROUBLE. POINTS SCORED DEPEND ON THE LOCATION OF THE HIT ON THE ENEMY SPACECRAFT. THE SPEED AT WHICH ENEMY SPACECRAFT MOVE INCREASES AS THE NUMBER OF THEM DECREASES. ONCE ALL SPACECRAFT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, ANOTHER WAVE STARTS, THE SPEED DECREASES AGAIN AND THE PROCESS REPEATS. A LIFE IS LOST WHEN A MISSILE IS HIT BY A SHOT OR COLLIDES WITH AN ASTEROID.

THREE GAME MODES ARE AVAILABLE, B&amp;W AND COLOR RECREATE THE GRAPHICS AND BEHAVIOUR OF THE ORIGINAL ARCADE GAME IN BLACK &amp; WHITE AND COLOR RESPECTIVELY WHILST NEO MODE UPDATES THE GAME WITH IMPROVED GRAPHICS AND SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BEHAVIOUR.

		<desc>GAME NO TETSUJIN: THE SHANGHAI ("IRON MAN GAME: THE SHANGHAI") IS A PUZZLE/BOARD GAME FOR THE SUPER FAMICOM AND IS BASED ON SHANGHAI, OR MAHJONG SOLITAIRE. IT WAS RELEASED ON THE SUPER FAMICOM EXCLUSIVELY IN JAPAN.

THE GAME FEATURES THREE DIFFERENT MODES:

    CLASSIC "SHANGHAI" MAHJONG SOLITAIRE, WHERE THE PLAYER CAN REMOVE ANY TWO TILES AS LONG AS THEY MATCH AND BOTH HAVE A FREE HORIZONTAL SIDE AND AREN'T TRAPPED WITH A PIECE ON TOP.
    "CHINHAI" OR "SICHUAN" MAHJONG SOLITAIRE, WHERE THE PLAYER CAN ONLY REMOVE PAIRED TILES IF THEY CAN BE CONNECTED WITH AN INVISIBLE LINE THAT BENDS AT A 90 DEGREE ANGLE TWO TIMES OR FEWER. THIS MODE FEATURES STACKED TILES, UNUSUAL FOR GAMES WITH THIS VARIANT, BUT HAS THE BENEFIT OF INSTANTLY REMOVING ANY PAIRED TILES THAT ARE TOUCHING.
    A UNIQUE BLOCK-PUSHING MODE WHERE THE PLAYER HAS AN AVATAR AND MUST MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE EXIT OF THE BOARD BY PUSHING CERTAIN MAHJONG TILES. WHEN A MAHJONG TILE CONNECTS TO ANOTHER LIKE IT, BOTH TILES VANISH. IF IT CONNECTS TO A DIFFERENT TILE, IT'LL CHANGE TO THAT TILE. SOME TILES CANNOT BE PUSHED, AND IF A PUSHABLE TILE CONNECTS TO ONE, IT TOO WILL BE IMMOVABLE AND THE PLAYER MAY END UP TRAPPED. THEY DO NOT HAVE TO REMOVE ALL THE TILES ON THE BOARD - THE ONLY GOAL IS TO REACH THE END.

THE GAME'S STORY MODE ALTERNATES THROUGH THESE THREE MODES, AND THE PLAYER CAN ALSO PLAY ANY OF THE THREE MODES DIRECTLY FROM THE MAIN MENU.</desc>

		<desc>THE YEAR IS 1880. TWO METEORS FELL ON EARTH ON A SMALL ISLAND NEAR NORTH AMERICAN PACIFIC COAST. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ISLAND THERE IS A SMALL TOWN GOVERNED BY A SHERIFF. AT FIRST, THE TOWN'S INHABITANTS DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO THE METEORS. BUT THEN, STRANGE THINGS STARTED HAPPENING. MONSTERS ATTACKED PEOPLE, AND LEFT ON THE VICTIMS' BODIES A MYSTERIOUS CREST WITH ONE WORD: DEMISEED. ONE DAY YOU, A YOUNG BOY WHO LIVES IN THE TOWN, ARE CONTACTED BY TWO ALIENS WHO CAME IN A MINIATURE SPACE SHIP. ONE OF THE ALIENS INTRODUCES HIMSELF AS ZERO, THE SPACE SHERIFF, AND EXPLAINS THAT AN INTERGALACTIC CRIMINAL NAMED DEMI HAS ESCAPED FROM JUSTICE AND IS HIDING SOMEWHERE ON THE ISLAND, BEING THE CAUSE OF ALL THE TROUBLES LATELY. ZERO THEN POSSESSES YOUR BODY, LENDS YOU HIS POWERS, AND COMMANDS YOU ON THE QUEST TO DESTROY DEMI AND TO BRING PEACE TO YOUR ISLAND AND TO THE ALIEN WORLD ALIKE!

THE GAME IS AN ACTION/ADVENTURE WITH SLIGHT RPG ELEMENTS (BUYING AND UPGRADING WEAPONS, ETC.) SET IN WILD WEST. WHILE FEATURING TRADITIONAL DUNGEON-CRAWLING AND MANY ENEMIES TO DISPOSE OF IN REAL TIME COMBAT, THE GAME DOESN'T EQUIP YOU WITH STANDARD MEDIEVAL SWORDS, BUT WITH PISTOLS, SHOTGUN, MACHINE GUN, AND EVEN A FLAMETHROWER. YOUR WEAPONS HAVE INFINITE AMMO. YOU CAN DUCK TO AVOID THE ALIEN MONSTERS' FIRE, AND PERFORM SPECIAL ATTACKS WITH VARIOUS TYPES OF WEAPONS.</desc>

GEKITOTSU DANGAN JIDOUSHA KESSEN: BATTLE MOBILE PLAYS SIMILARLY TO SPYHUNTER IN BOTH PERSPECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE, BUT YOUR CAR IN BATTLE MOBILE ISN'T QUITE AS HIGH TECH AN INSTRUMENT AS THAT OTHER GAME'S VEHICLE. YOU CAN LAUNCH UNLIMITED MISSILES, BUT THEY CAN ONLY HIT HELICOPTERS. FOR GROUND BASED TARGETS YOU MUST DASH INTO THEM TO RAM THEM OFF THE ROAD. YOUR CAR'S HEALTH IS CONSTANTLY DWINDLING, EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT BEING ATTACKED BY ENEMIES, SO PICKING UP THE OCCASIONALLY APPEARING ENERGY REFILL ITEMS IS ESSENTIAL. SHIELDS CAN BE PICKED UP AND STORED THAT WILL MAKE YOUR CAR INVULNERABLE TO ALL DAMAGE FOR A SHORT WHILE.</desc>

BY GOBBLING UP THEIR COMPETITION, AND WITH THE HELP OF NEW WEAPONS TECHNOLOGY, CONEX IS ON THE CUSP OF CONTROLLING THE WORLD. ONLY A HERO FROM THE LAST WAR CAN DEFY THEM AND STOP THEIR PLANS OF CONQUEST.

GENOCIDE 2 IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE PC RELEASE. THE PLAYER TAKES CONTROL OF A TEN METER TALL ROBOTIC NINJA: THE TRACER. ITS ONLY FORM OF ATTACK IS A SWORD, BUT IT CAN HOLD SEVERAL EXTRA WEAPONS, AND ALWAYS HAS ACCESS TO THE BETTY. THE BETTY CAN BE FIRED IN EIGHT DIRECTIONS, RETURNS TO THE TRACER AFTER BEING FIRED, AND CAN BLOCK ENEMY BULLETS. THE OBJECTIVE OF EACH STAGE IS TO REACH THE END, AND SOME STAGES REQUIRE YOU TO DESTROY TARGETS ALONG THE WAY. ANY ITEMS PICKED UP BY THE PLAYER, OR DAMAGE DONE TO THE TRACER, CARRIES OVER BETWEEN STAGES, AND EACH STAGE RECORDS YOUR FASTEST TIME FOR BEATING THEM.

ASIDE FROM THE VISUAL DOWNGRADE, GENOCIDE 2 ALSO LOST MANY MINOR ENEMY TYPES AND ONE MID-BOSS IN THE TRANSITION TO THE SUPER FAMICOM. THE FIRST STAGE WAS REMOVED, AND THE FIRST TWO LEVELS OF STAGE 2 WERE REVERSED. THE BETTY NOW CAN ONLY BE USED FOR A LIMITED TIME, AND MUST RECHARGE WHEN ITS TIME HAS RUN OUT.</desc>

ASIDE FROM RECEIVING ORDERS FROM YOUR BOSS BEFORE EACH LEVEL, AND THE QUICK CONVERSATION WITH A BOSS OR RARE NPC, THE STORY WON'T ATTEMPT TO GET IN THE WAY OF BEAT-DOWNS.

THERE ARE THREE PLAYABLE CHARACTERS IN GHOST CHASER DENSEI: THE MARTIAL ARTIST MAKAI, THE MACE WIELDING CAT-GIRL IYO, AND THE AUTONOMOUS ROBOT BELVA. EACH HAS UNIQUE MOVES AS WELL AS THE BASIC ABILITIES OF ATTACKING, JUMPING, BLOCKING, THROWING, AND USING A SPECIAL IF ATTACK AND JUMP ARE PRESSED TOGETHER. UNLIKE MOST BRAWLERS THESE SPECIAL MOVES DEPLETE A RECHARGING SPECIAL BAR, NOT YOUR HEALTH. MAKAI CAN THROW FIREBALLS AND DO A FLYING KICK IN MIDAIR, IYO CAN TRIANGLE JUMP AND PREFORM A SPINNING PILEDRIVER, AND BELVA CAN DOUBLE JUMP AND PREFORM A GRAPPLE SPECIAL. CHARACTERS ALSO HAVE A TEAM UP SPECIAL IF PLAYING IN TWO PLAYER MODE. ENEMIES RANGE FROM ARMORED SOLDIERS TO LIZARD MEN TO ROBOTS, BUT MOST BREAK DOWN INTO THE SAME HIERARCHY: WEAKER TYPES WILL RUSH AT YOU WHILE STRONGER TYPES WILL SHOOT PROJECTILES THEN RUSH AT YOU. EACH LEVEL ENDS WITH A UNIQUE BOSS WITH MULTIPLE SHORT AND LONG RANGE ATTACKS.</desc>

		<name>GT Racing</name>
		<desc>GT RACING IS A SUPER FAMICOM RACING VIDEO GAME WHERE THE PLAYER GETS TO DRIVE A GRAN TURISMO CAR IN EITHER CHAMPIONSHIP OR PRACTICE MODE.  THE GAME IS BASED ON THE 1996 SUPER GT RACING SEASON USING THE HORSEPOWER STANDARDS AND RULES OF THE ERA.  

DURING CHAMPIONSHIP MODE, THE PLAYER IS ASKED ENTER A NUMBER, HIS OR HER DRIVER'S NAME, AND THE TEAM NAME THAT HE OR SHE WILL USE DURING THE CHAMPIONSHIP. THE DRIVER'S NAME AND TEAM CAN BE ENTERED USING EITHER ENGLISH OR JAPANESE LETTERS. WHEN A PLAYER BEATS A RECORD, HE OR SHE IS ASKED TO INSERT HIS OR HER NUMBER, NAME OR INITIALS (UP TO FOUR CHARACTERS AND TWO DIGITS FOR THE NUMBER). CHAMPIONSHIP MODE CAN LAST FOR MULTIPLE SEASONS. PLAYING NINETY-NINE SEASONS IN A SINGLE RACING CAREER IS THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE DUE TO THE DOUBLE-DIGIT NATURE OF THE SEASON INFORMATION. THERE ARE EIGHT DIFFERENT TRACKS, INCLUDING THE SUZUKA CIRCUIT THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN IN VIDEO GAMES SINCE POLE POSITION II AND FUJI SPEEDWAY (COMPLETE WITH A VIRTUALLY PHOTOREALISTIC MOUNT FUJI IN THE BACKGROUND).

VERSUS MODE IS FOR TWO HUMAN PLAYERS ONLY AND THE RECORD OPTIONS ALLOWS THE PLAYERS TO LOOK AT HIS OR HER PREVIOUS RECORDS. IN A RACE, THERE ARE UP TO FIFTEEN OPPONENTS TO RACE AGAINST. THE PLAYER GETS REWARDED WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO UPGRADE HIS OR HER EQUIPMENT AFTER A TOP FIVE FINISH ON ANY RACE COURSE. BONUS EQUIPMENT INCLUDES A FASTER ENGINE, BETTER TIRES, AND A SPECIAL DOSE OF NITROUS OXIDE CREATED SPECIFICALLY FOR GRAN TURISMO VEHICLES. ALL OF THE BONUS AUTOMOBILE PARTS ARE AUTOMATICALLY INSTALLED IN THE APPROPRIATE PARTS FOR SUPERCHARGING THE VEHICLE. ONCE ALL THE SPECIAL PARTS ARE EARNED, THE AUTOMOBILE IS CONSIDERED TO BE FULLY UPGRADED. THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO WIN THE GRAN TURISMO CHAMPIONSHIP FOR HIS OR HER TEAM IN ADDITION FOR HIM/HERSELF.

THE "FREE PRACTICE" IS ESSENTIALLY A TIME TRIAL MODE WHERE THE PLAYER RACES BY HIM/HERSELF FOR UP TO TEN LAPS. ACQUIRING DAMAGE IS STILL POSSIBLE EITHER CRASHING INTO WALLS OR THROUGH NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR. THE FASTEST LAP TIME GETS CAPTURED FOR THE RECORD BOOK JUST LIKE IN THE OTHER MODES OF THE GAME. BEFORE BEING ABLE TO PRACTICE FREELY, THE PLAYER CAN ALSO CHOOSE THE WEATHER CONDITION AND THE SETUP OF HIS VEHICLE</desc>

		<name>Holy Umbrella : Dondera no Mubou!!</name>
		<desc>IN "HOLY UMBRELLA", YOU CONTROL A SCHOOLBOY WHO LIVES IN MODERN-DAY JAPAN. ONE DAY, THE SKY SUDDENLY TURNS DARK BLUE, A HEAVY RAIN FALLS ONTO THE CITY, AND THE BOY FINDS, HALFWAY BETWEEN HIS HOUSE AND THE SCHOOL, AN UMBRELLA WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY. WHAT HE DOES NOT KNOW IS THAT THE UMBRELLA IS MAGICAL! THE MOMENT HE TOUCHES IT, HE IS TRANSFERED TO A PARALLEL UNIVERSE. IMMEDIATELY, HE IS ATTACKED BY A HUGE TANK, BUT A STRANGE OLD MAN WITH A TALKING BIRD SAVES HIM. IT SEEMS THAT AN EVIL CREATURE NAMED DONDERA IS THREATENING THE COUNTRY WITH THE TERRIBLE MONSTERS SHE CREATED. BUT IS IT REALLY SO? YOU VISIT THE CAPITAL TOWN, TALK TO THE EMPEROR, AND DECIDE TO INVESTIGATE THE MATTER...

"HOLY UMBRELLA" IS ESSENTIALLY A PLATFORM ACTION GAME, BUT UNLIKE MOST OTHER GAMES OF THIS GENRE, IT ALLOWS YOU TO VISIT TOWNS, WHERE YOU CONTROL YOUR HERO IN A STANDARD RPG-LIKE TOP-DOWN FASHION. YOU CAN ENTER HOUSES, TALK TO TOWNSPEOPLE, ETC. ON PLATFORM LEVELS, WHICH ARE THE MAIN PART OF THE GAME, YOU HAVE TO SWITCH BETWEEN THE HERO, THE TALKING BIRD BONTO WHO ACCOMPANIES YOU ON YOUR QUEST, AND THE GIRL SAKI, WHOM YOU MEET LATER IN THE GAME. EVERY CHARACTER HAS HIS/HER OWN SPECIAL ABILITIES AND OWN WAYS OF FIGHTING: THE HERO CAN SLIDE THROUGH AIR BY USING THE UMBRELLA, BONTO CAN DOUBLE-JUMP ON HIGH LEDGES, SAKI CAN JUMP ON WALLS, ETC. YOU USE YOUR UMBRELLA AS A WEAPON, AS WELL AS ELEMENTAL STONES YOU CAN COLLECT ON YOUR WAY AND THROW AT ENEMIES. YOU ALSO FIND VARIOUS POWER-UPS AND ITEMS YOU CAN EQUIP ON THE HERO.</desc>

THE B-MOVIE STORY IS CHEESY AND DOES NOTHING MORE THAN ACCOMMODATE FOR THE ACTION. FROM THE INTRODUCTION SEQUENCE: "THE PERIL CAME FROM OUTER SPACE. A METEORITE ENTERED THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE BRINGING CHAOS. AFTER OBSERVATION, THE SCIENTISTS FOUND THAT THE METEORITE WAS RADIOACTIVE AND HAD TO BE DESTROYED. UNFORTUNATELY, TERRORISTS FROM G.H.O.S.T. WANT THE METEORITE TOO. THE IRON COMMANDO'S MISSION IS TO RETRIEVE THE DEADLY BODY AND AVOID GENETIC MUTATION."

THE PLAYER OR PLAYERS WALK ALONG THE LEVELS BEATING UP ENEMIES. ON SOME LEVELS YOU RIDE A MOTORCYCLE OR JEEP, EVEN A MINE KART, AND SHOOT YOUR WAY THROUGH HORDES OF ENEMIES. THERE ARE SEVERAL END BOSSES, SOME ARE SCREEN FILLING LIKE A HELICOPTER AND A GIANT ROBOT.

SOME ENEMIES WILL DROP FOOD, GRENADES OR WEAPONS AS YOU BEAT THEM INTO A BLOODY PULP. THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT WEAPONS: 9MM GUNS, SHOTGUNS, MACHINE GUNS, KNIVES, BASEBALL BATS. THE WEIRD THING IS, ENEMIES THAT USE A SWORD AND EVEN DOGS WILL OCCASIONALLY DROP A MACHINE GUN OR BASEBALL BAT.</desc>

THE GAME FEATURES A STORY MODE WITH INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT OPPONENTS - IT ALSO HAS A TUTORIAL FOR ITS OBTUSE MECHANICS - AS WELL AS A FREE MODE WHERE THE PLAYER TRIES TO SURVIVE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND A VERSUS MODE FOR MULTIPLE HUMAN PLAYERS. IN THE SINGLE-PLAYER MODES, THE PLAYER CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN A MALE OR FEMALE AVATAR.

THE GOAL OF THE GAME IS TAKE A PAIR OF FALLING DICE, EACH WITH A SPECIFIC COLOR AND NUMBER ATTACHED TO THEM, AND DROP THEM INTO A GRID WITH OTHER FALLEN DICE. IF A DIE IS ON A LINE HORIZONTALLY, VERTICALLY OR DIAGONALLY WITH ANOTHER DIE OF THE SAME COLOR, BOTH THOSE DICE AND EVERY DIE IN-BETWEEN WILL DROP BY ONE IN VALUE. ONCE A DIE HAS REACHED "1" AND IS INVOLVED IN ANOTHER COMBO, IT DISAPPEARS. DICE ON TOP FALL IN THE GAPS LEFT BEHIND, POTENTIALLY CREATING CHAIN REACTIONS. THERE ARE ALSO POWER-UPS THAT WILL EITHER HELP THE PLAYER OUT OR CREATE PROBLEMS FOR THE OPPONENT. THE GAME ENDS ONCE THE DICE STACK TO THE TOP OF THE SCREEN.</desc>

		<desc>JELLY BOY 2 IS THE UNRELEASED SQUEAL TO JERRY BOY, KNOWN AS SMART BALL IN THE US, THAT WAS PLANNED TO BE RELEASED IN 1994 FOR THE SUPER FAMICOM. THE GAME WAS DEVELOPED BY GAME FREAK AND WAS GOING TO BE PUBLISHED BY SONY MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT BUT IT WAS CANCELED SUPPOSEDLY BECAUSE OF SONY'S IMPENDING RELEASE OF THE PLAYSTATION. HOWEVER JELLY BOY 2'S DEVELOPMENT WAS COMPLETED AND A ROM OF THE GAME EVENTUALLY LEAKED ONTO THE INTERNET. KINGMIKE'S TRANSLATION CREATED AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION PATCH FOR JELLY BOY 2 THAT WAS RELEASED ON OCTOBER 16, 2006.</desc>

		<desc>THE GAME INVOLVES GOING THROUGH 8 STAGES (BROKEN UP INTO TWO PARTS EACH) OF SIDE-SCROLLING ACTION. AT THE END OF EACH STAGE IS A BOSS MONSTER THAT MUST BE DISPOSED OF.

JERRY MOVES BY SLIDING ACROSS THE GROUND AND CAN LATCH ON TO WALLS AND CLIMB THEM. JERRY CAN ALSO JUMP, STRETCH OUT TO CLING TO CEILINGS, AND ALSO MOVE AT A FASTER PACE. JERRY CAN CONSUME BALLS THAT HE FINDS DURING A STAGE AND CAN THEN FIRE THEM OUT OF HIS BODY AT ENEMIES BLOCKING HIS PATH. ENEMIES CAN ALSO BE DEFEATED BY JUMPING ON THEM AND THEN FLATTENING JERRY'S BODY ON THEM. ALSO, THERE ARE FLOWERS THAT CONTAIN ITEMS FOR JERRY TO COLLECT. ITEMS INCLUDE LIFE, WHICH REFILLS HEALTH, A 1-UP THAT ADDS AN EXTRA LIFE, AND A SEED, WHICH WILL GROW A CLIMBABLE BEANSTALK WHEN PLANTED. IF THE PLAYER COLLECTS THE SCATTERED LETTERS THAT APPEAR IN EVERY STAGE THAT SPELL OUT THE NAME JERRY, THE PLAYER WILL EARN TWO EXTRA LIVES.</desc>

		<name>Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius</name>
		<desc>THE THIRD IN THE PAROIDUS SERIES, IT'S THE SAME GAMEPLAY AND ZANINESS THAT SUBSTANTIATED THE FIRST TWO GAMES. GAMEPLAY ITSELF IS A COPY (A PARODY RATHER) OF KONAMI'S FAMOUS GRADIUS SERIES IN THAT THE SCREEN SCROLLS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT (MOST TIMES) AND YOU MANEUVER AROUND THE SCREEN DESTROYING WAVES OF ENEMIES AND AVOIDING OBSTACLES. UNLIKE PREVIOUS PARODIUS TITLES, THIS GAME CONTAINS A DIFFICULTY ADJUSTMENT OPTION, ALLOWING THE PLAYER TO MAKE THINGS EASIER... OR HARDER. ALSO UNIQUE TO THIS PARODIUS TITLE IS A BIT OF JAPANESE DIGITAL VOICE THAT SHOUTS OUT VARIOUS THINGS AT YOU WHILE YOU PLAY. SURVIVAL THROUGHOUT THE LEVEL EARNS YOU A BOSS FIGHT, WHICH FREQUENTLY INCLUDES SOME OF THE STRANGEST CHARACTERS IN THE GAME. MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS *IS* GRADIUS,  BUT WITH ALL SORTS OF STRANGE GRAPHICS, MUSIC AND REFERENCES TO OTHER KONAMI GAMES... SO IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S PARODIUS!

THERE ARE NOW MORE POWER-UPS THAN EVER INCLUDING THE STANDARD POWER-UP (RED, USED TO UPGRADE WEAPONS), THE SHIELD POWER-UP (BLUE) AND A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT COLOURED BELLS. GREEN BELLS WILL MAKE YOU HUGE ON THE SCREEN, YELLOW BELLS ARE WORTH POINTS (POINTS IN TURN ARE WORTH EXTRA LIVES),  BLUE BELLS ARE "BIG BOMBS" THAT CLEAR THE SCREEN OF ENEMIES/SHOTS AND CAN BE SAVED UNTIL YOU NEED THEM, WHITE BELLS WILL GIVE YOUR CHARACTER A MEGAPHONE THAT WILL SHOUT OUT JAPANESE PHRASES, THE CHARACTERS OF THE PHRASES THEMSELVES CAN BE USED TO DAMAGE ENEMIES (THE POWER OF WORDS!), THE RED BELL STOCKPILES YOU WITH THREE POINT-DEFENSE LASERS... ONLY ONE OF WHICH CAN BE ACTIVATED AT A TIME AND DISAPPEAR AFTER A SHORT WHILE. FINALLY THE PURPLE BELL WILL CLEAR THE SCREEN OF ALL BUT THE STRONGEST ENEMIES... AND WILL TURN THEM INTO POWER-UPS.

THIS TIME AROUND THERE ARE 16 DIFFERENT CHARACTERS TO CHOSE FROM AND THE POWER-UPS AND WEAPONS THAT THEY USE ARE MORE UNIQUE THAN EVER. SEVERAL FAMILIAR "FACES" RETURN AND THEY'VE BROUGHT ALONG FRIENDS TO SHARE IN THE PARTY:
VIC VIPER: THE "GRADIUS SHIP" APPEARS ONCE AGAIN IN THIS GRADIUS PARODY, EQUIPPED WITH IT'S TRADITIONAL GRADIUS WEAPONS
2. LORD BRITISH: THE "OTHER" GRADIUS SHIP AND ARGUABLY THE MORE FAMOUS OF THE TWO. LORD BRITISH HAS WEAPONS SIMILAR TO VIC BUT QUITE DIFFERENT ALSO.MISSILES AND SHIELDS WORK DIFFERENTLY FOR INSTANCE. AND LORD BRITISH USES A RIPPLE GUN INSTEAD OF A DOUBLE SHOT.
3. PENTARO: IT JUST WOULDN'T BE A PARODIUS GAME IF PENTARO WASN'T INVOLVED. ORIGINALLY FROM KONAMI'S PENGUIN ADVENTURE, PENTARO RETAINS THE SAME ABILITIES FROM PREVIOUS PARODIUS GAMES... HOWEVER HIS POTION WEAPON MAY NOW HIT MULTIPLE ENEMIES AND HIS NORMAL WEAPON SHOTS EXPLODE AGAINST OBSTACLES
4. HANAKO: ALSO FROM PENGUIN ADVENTURE, HANAKO THE PENGUIN IS PENTARO'S GIRLFRIEND. WHILE PENTARO IS BLUE, SHE IS THE RED PENGUIN. SHE PLAYS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO PENTARO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HER S. BOMB WEAPON
5. TWINBEE: TWINBEE, FROM THE TWINBEE GAMES IS ANOTHER RETURNING PARODIUS STAR. UNFORTUNATELY HE HASN'T BEEN UPGRADED SINCE PREVIOUS GAMES, SO HIS WEAPONS ARE NEARLY IDENTICAL; PUNCHING GLOVE ROCKET AND ALL...
6. WINBEE: WINBEE, ALSO FROM TWINBEE IS RED AND HAS MOVES IDENTICAL TO TWINBEE, EXCEPT FOR ONE DIFFERENCE... WHEN SHE HAS 3 OPTIONS AVAILABLE, SHE CAN POWER THEM UP TO HARM ENEMIES THAT TOUCH THEM.
7. TAKO: AGAIN, IT JUST WOULDN'T BE A PARODIUS GAME WITHOUT A FLYING OCTOPUS. AND HERE HE IS, STILL WEARING A BASEBALL CAP, BUT OTHERWISE UNCHANGED FROM PREVIOUS PARODIUS GAMES.
8. BELIAL: A YELLOW FEMALE OCTOPUS WITH A BOW IN HER HAIR, SHE IS IDENTICAL TO TAKO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HER MISSILE AND DOUBLE WEAPONS... WHICH ARE INSTEAD IDENTICAL TO THE VIC VIPER.
9. SOITSU: A STICKMAN (NOW GREEN) SURFING ABOARD A PAPER AIRPLANE, SOITSU PLAYS SIMILAR TO KOITSU FROM THE PREVIOUS GAME, ASIDE FROM HIS COLOUR. HIS LASER WEAPON IS ABLE TO CHARGE UP TO DELIVER MORE POWER AND HE DROPS LITTLE STICKMEN ONTO THE GROUND WHICH OCCASIONALLY DANCE AROUND RATHER THAN ATTACKING. ADDITIONALLY HE HAS AN "UPGRADE POWER" (S. POWER) THAT MAKE ALL HIS OTHER ABILITIES STRONGER
10. DOITSU: SIMILAR TO SOITSU BUT WITH A DOUBLE LASER ABILITY. HE IS AN ORANGE STICKMAN RIDING ON A PAPER AIRPLANE AND NO "UPGRADE" POWER, USING NORMAL OPTIONS INSTEAD
11. UPA: UPA AKA THE FLYING BABY IS BACK FROM THE PREVIOUS PARODIUS GAME (AS WELL AS HIS ORIGINAL GAME, BOKUTTE UPA) AND PLAYS NEARLY THE SAME. INSTEAD OF A SHIELD, HE HAS A MEGA CRUSH POWER THAT DAMAGES ALL ON-SCREEN ENEMIES... AND ALSO HAS AN "UPGRADE POWER" IN THE FORM OF GRADE UP THAT MAKES HIS OTHER ABILITIES STRONGER.
12. RUPA: ANOTHER FLYING BABY (PRESUMABLY ALSO FROM BOKUTTE UPA), RUPA PLAYS SIMILAR TOT UPA BUT WITH A MULTI SPREAD GUN WHICH FIRES MISSILES IN MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS (WITH EACH UPGRADE) AND A S.VULCAN GUN WHICH AUTOMATICALLY AIMS TOWARDS ENEMIES.
13. MIKE: A CUTE LITTLE KITTEN WHO HAPPENS TO TO HAVE A VERY POWERFUL WAVE WEAPON WHICH CAN TRAVEL THROUGH OBSTACLES AND ENEMIES. ADDITIONALLY HE HAS A MULTIPLE BOMB ABILITY WHICH REQUIRES HIS "UPGRADE ABILITY" (GRADE UP) TO GET REALLY POWERFUL
14. RANI: ANOTHER CUTE KITTEN (THIS ONE ROLLED ONTO HIS BOTTOM FACING FORWARD) WITH VERY POWER WEAPONRY. SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE A REFLECT WEAPON WHEREIN THE SHOTS BOUNCE OFF OF OBSTACLES. ANOTHER IS THE S LASER WHICH TRAVELS FORWARD BUT THEN HOMES IN UP OR DOWN TO HIT THE ENEMY. AND FINALLY, RANI'S MISSILE WEAPON IS TWO HOMING BELLS. RANI ALSO HAS AN "UPGRADE ABILITY" IN THE FORM OF GRADE UP, HOWEVER IT ONLY UPGRADES THE REFLECT SHOT.
15. MEMIM: ONE OF THE FAIRY CHARACTERS, MEMIM IS A FEMALE FLYING GIRL WITH STANDARD FEMALE BIKINI CLOTHING. SHE CARRIES SOME UNIQUE MISSILE WEAPONS HOWEVER, WHOSE DIRECTION IS DETERMINED BY MEMIM'S CURRENT LOCATION ON THE SCREEN WHEN FIRED.
16. SUE: THE OTHER FAIRY WITH TIGHT CLOTHING, SUE IS UNIQUE IN THAT HER WEAPONS ARE UPGRADED/DISPLAYED IN A DIFFERENT ORDER FROM EVERYBODY ELSE'S IN THE GAME. FOR INSTANCE HER OPTION IS THE 4TH WEAPON ON THE LIST RATHER THAN THE 6TH... REQUIRING LESS POWER-UPS TO ACTIVATE IT. HOWEVER ASIDE FROM THAT... ALL OF HER WEAPONS ARE THE EXACT SAME AS THE VIC VIPER'S.</desc>

THE GAMEPLAY IS CLASSIC BUT DREADFULLY ACCURATE. IN ATTACK IT IS NECESSARY TO PLACE AND HAVE A GOD LIKE TIMING TO GET A GOOD STROKE OF THE BAT. A RECTANGLE IS DISPLAYED IN FRONT OF THE BATTER DELIMITING THE AREA IN WHICH THE PITCHER CAN PLACE THE BALL WITHOUT BEING AT FAULT, AND A SMALL SQUARE, SUCH AS A VIEWFINDER, SHOWS THE PLACE WHERE WE WILL HIT. AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN, A "MIRROR" VIEW SHOWS OUR BATTERS FACE AND BEHIND HIM, THE RECEIVER OF THE OPPOSING TEAM. IT IS NECESSARY TO OBSERVE HIS GLOVE TO GET AN IDEA OF WHERE THE PITCHER WILL THROW. IN DEFENSE WE WILL RUN, DIVE AND QUICKLY RETHROW THE BALL IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE OPPONENTS WHO MANAGED TO HIT THE BALL. THE GAME MODES OFFER A CLASSIC CHAMPIONSHIP WITH ALL THE REAL PROFESSIONAL TEAMS OF JAPANESE LEAGUES AND A SCENARIO MODE WHERE WE TAKE A MATCH IN PROGRESS IN A GIVEN SITUATION. THERE IS ALSO AN ESSENTIAL TRAINING MODE TO IMPROVE.</desc>

		<desc>JIKKYOU POWERFUL PRO YAKYUU 3 IS THE THIRD MAJOR GAME IN THE POWERFUL PRO SERIES. THIS GAME WAS RELEASED ON FEBRUARY 29, 1996 FOR THE SUPER FAMICOM ONLY IN JAPAN BY KONAMI. THE GAME WAS DEVELOPED BY DIAMOND HEAD, A DEVELOPER BEHIND MANY JIKKYOU POWERFUL PRO GAMES. POWERFUL PRO 3 IS A TRADITIONAL BASEBALL SIMULATOR, IN THE "SUPER DEFORMED" OR "CHIBI" STYLE THAT MAKES THE FRANCHISE WELL-KNOWN.

THE GAME IS FAIRLY SIMILAR TO ITS PREDECESSORS, JIKKYOU POWERFUL PRO YAKYUU '94 AND JIKKYOU POWERFUL PRO YAKYUU 2, ALTHOUGH IT DOES ADD SOME NEW FEATURES, SUCH AS SUCCESS MODE. SUCCESS MODE IS AN RPG-ESQUE MODE WHERE PLAYERS DEVELOP A BASEBALL PLAYER, GUIDING THEM THROUGH SITUATIONS AND FORMING THEM INTO A "POWERFUL PRO."

THE REAL DRAW OF THE POWERFUL PRO SERIES IS THE SUCCESS MODE, WHICH WAS STARTED WITH THIS GAME. IT PUTS THE PLAYER IN CONTROL OF A PRE-MADE CHARACTER WHO THE PLAYER MUST DEVELOP INTO A POWERFUL ATHLETE. THIS IS DONE BY GUIDING THE PLAYER THROUGH SITUATIONS, MAKING DECISIONS, ETC. AS A MORE "ROLE-PLAYING GAME"-ESQUE PART OF THE GAME, THIS ACTUALLY PROVIDES PLAYERS WITH MULTIPLE SAVE SLOTS AND OPTIONS.</desc>

IN A FUTURISTIC WORLD, THERE LIVES A YOUNG MAN NAMED JOJO WHO HOLDS A TERRIBLE POWER WITHIN: THE POWER TO DRAIN LIFE FROM ENEMIES. THIS POWER IS SOMEHOW CONNECTED TO THE EVIL VAMPIRE DIO WHO IS TERRORIZING THE WORLD. JOJO MUST FIND FAITHFUL COMPANIONS ON HIS QUEST TO RESTORE PEACE AND TO MASTER THE POWER WITHIN HIMSELF.

IN THIS GAME, YOU NAVIGATE JOJO IN AN ADVENTURE-LIKE FASHION, VIEWING THE HERO FROM THIRD-PERSON PERSPECTIVE. YOU CAN CALL UP A MENU AT ANY TIME TO CHOOSE A COMMAND SUCH AS "LOOK", "TALK", ETC. BEING A JAPANESE ADVENTURE, THE GAME DOESN'T CONTAIN PUZZLES. FROM TIME TO TIME, YOU'LL BE ATTACKED BY ENEMIES AND WILL FIGHT THEM IN TURN-BASED COMBAT VIEWED FROM FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE. JOJO AND HIS PARTY MEMBERS POSSESS THE SO-CALLED "STANDS", SUPER-POWERFUL CREATURES YOU SUMMON DURING FIGHTS. BEFORE EACH FIGHT, YOU'LL HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE OF FICE AVAILABLE TAROT CARDS TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF LUCK AND COMPATIBILITY OF THE STANDS YOU'LL HAVE IN THE GAME.</desc>

		<name>Kirby no Kirakira Kids</name>
		<desc>A TETRIS-LIKE PUZZLE GAME. THERE ARE VARYING MODES OF PLAY, SUCH AS TIME TRIAL, CHALLENGE AND STORY MODE, BUT THE BASIC IDEA OF PLAY IS THE SAME: YOU MUST SANDWICH STAR BLOCKS BETWEEN TWO LIKE FRIEND BLOCKS, EITHER HORIZONTALLY OR VERTICALLY. THE FRIEND BLOCKS AND ANY STAR BLOCKS IN-BETWEEN ARE THEN REMOVED FROM PLAY. SIMILAR TO TETRIS, SETS OF BLOCKS FALL INTO THE BIN THAT CONTAIN ANY TWO OF THE FOLLOWING TYPES:

STAR BLOCKS: THE MOST IMPORTANT BLOCK, AS ALL OF THE GAME TYPES RELY ON IT. SANDWICH THESE BLOCKS BETWEEN TWO FRIEND BLOCKS EITHER HORIZONTALLY OR VERTICALLY, AND THEY WILL BE CLEARED. THE MORE STARS YOU CLEAR, THE HIGHER THE SCORE.

FRIEND BLOCKS: THESE BLOCKS HAVE PICTURES OF KIRBY'S FRIENDS - RICK THE HAMSTER, KINE THE FISH, AND COO THE OWL (ALL FROM KIRBY'S DREAM LAND 2) - ON THEM. MATCH TWO OF EACH TO CLEAR THEM FROM THE SCREEN. ANY STAR BLOCKS BETWEEN THE TWO CHARACTER BLOCKS WILL ALSO BE CLEARED.

BOMB BLOCKS: SANDWICH A BOMB BLOCK IN BETWEEN TWO FRIEND BLOCKS, AND THE BOMB WILL EXPLODE, REMOVING ALL BLOCKS IN THE SAME ROW.

HARD BLOCKS: YOU HAVE TO CLEAR THESE BLOCKS TWICE TO CLEAR THEM FROM THE SCREEN. CLEAR THEM ONCE AND THEY TRANSFORM INTO AN ORDINARY STAR BLOCK, AND THEN CAN BE REMOVED IN THE NORMAL WAY.

THE GAME ALSO FEATURES A 'CHAIN' SYSTEM THAT REWARDS YOU FOR CLEARING BLOCKS WHICH THEN CLEAR OTHER BLOCKS. IF YOU CLEAR TWO OR MORE BLOCKS IN THIS MANNER, THEN YOU'LL BE REWARDED WITH KIRBY RAINING DOWN THAT AMOUNT OF STARS, WHICH CAN FILL IN GAPS, WHICH IN TURN COULD COMPLETE A ROW AND ALLOW IT TO CHAIN EVEN FURTHER.</desc>

IN KISHIN DOUJI ZENKI: BATTLE RAIDEN THE PLAYER TAKES THE ROLE OF ZENKI. AT FIRST, AND OCCASIONALLY THROUGH THE GAME, ZENKI WILL BE IN HIS POWERED DOWN FORM WHERE HE CAN ONLY PUNCH, JUMP, AND DASH. AFTER CHIAKI RECOVERS HER BRACELET, OR REGAINS HER CONCENTRATION, OR WHATEVER SHE NEEDS TO DO AT THE TIME, SHE CAN TRANSFORM ZENKI INTO HIS POWERED UP FORM. IN THIS FORM ZENKI DEALS MORE DAMAGE AND HAS A MUCH LONGER LIST OF ATTACKS THAT GET ADDED TO AS THE GAME PROGRESSES, SUCH AS A PILLAR OF ENERGY, AN ELECTRIFIED PUNCH, AND A DASHING ATTACK. BY PICKING UP SCROLLS ZENKI CAN DO A POWERFUL RUDORA ATTACK TO ALL ENEMIES ON SCREEN, BUT THIS ATTACK DAMAGES ZENKI AS WELL.

TO COMPLETE PLATFORMING LEVELS ZENKI WILL HAVE TO MAKE IT TO THE END OF THE LEVEL WHILE OCCASIONALLY FINDING HIDDEN STONE MONUMENTS THAT, WHEN DESTROYED, WILL DROP ITEMS AS WELL AS ALTER THE LEVEL OR REMOVE OBSTACLES, ALLOWING ZENKI TO PASS. AFTER A STAGE'S FIRST PLATFORMING LEVEL IS A MIDBOSS FIGHT, AND AFTER THE SECOND PLATFORMING LEVEL IS THE BOSS FIGHT PROPER.</desc>

THE OTHER MODE IS A MORE CARTOONISH PLATFORMER FEATURING CHIAKI AS SHE ATTEMPTS TO ASSIST ZENKI BY COMPLETING VARIOUS OBJECTIVES. CHIAKI RESORTS TO HER MAGIC TO PROTECT HERSELF.</desc>

YOU CAN ALSO CHOOSE AMONG A SERIES OF FORMATIONS AND AI PROFILES IN CASE YOU PLAY ALONE, ALTHOUGH YOU CAN USE A MULTI-TAP TO PLAY WITH UP TO 4 PLAYERS.

AVAILABLE GAME MODES INCLUDE TOURNAMENT, VS AND MECHABUTSUKE MODE WHICH IS A VARIATION ON VS THAT INVOLVES A FREE-ROAMING COURT AND NO OUTFIELDERS.</desc>

IT WAS JUST AN ORDINARY PLACE UNTIL THE LAST OWNER, BENEDICT WEATHERTOP, STARTED PRACTICING BLACK MAGIC. HE KILLED HIS PARENTS AND POPULATED THE MANSION WITH ALL KINDS OF UNDEAD. SINCE THEN, NOBODY DARED TO APPROACH THE MANSION. BUT A SHORT WHILE AGO, TWO BOYS WERE FOUND DEAD NEAR THIS HORRIBLE PLACE. APPARENTLY, THE BOYS HAD TRIED TO ENTER THE MANSION. ANOTHER EVIDENCE POINTED OUT THAT A GIRL FOLLOWED THEM - BUT HER BODY HASN'T BEEN FOUND YET, AND THERE IS A SLIGHT HOPE SHE MIGHT BE ALIVE. 
THIS IS WHERE YOU, THE HERO OF THE GAME, DECIDE TO INVESTIGATE THE MYSTERY, AND TO VENTURE INTO THE MANSION...

"DEVIL OF LAPLACE" IS A HYBRID BETWEEN SURVIVAL HORROR AND TRADITIONAL JAPANESE RPG, SIMILAR TO THE PIONEER OF THIS GENRE,  SWEET HOME FOR NES. UNLIKE "SWEET HOME", THIS GAME HAS LESS PUZZLES AND IS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS RPG ELEMENTS. YOU ARE NOT STUCK IN THE MANSION, BUT CAN LEAVE IT, VISIT THE TOWN, AND BUY SUPPLIES. LATER YOU ALSO VISIT OTHER LOCATIONS SUCH AS A CASTLE, ETC. THE BATTLES ARE RANDOM, TURN-BASED, AND ARE VIEWED FROM FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE. THE HERO OF THE GAME CAN RECRUIT THREE OTHER CHARACTERS TO THE PARTY OF FIVE AVAILABLE. EACH CHARACTER (INCLUDING THE HERO, TO WHOM YOU ASSIGN GENDER AND CLASS) BELONGS TO ONE OF THE FIVE CHARACTER CLASSES: DILETTANTE, MEDIUM, DETECTIVE, SCIENTIST, OR JOURNALIST. DILETTANTE IS AN ALL-AROUND CHARACTER WITH DEFENSIVE MAGIC, MEDIUM IS A KIND OF A BLACK MAGE, DETECTIVE IS A MELEE FIGHTER, SCIENTIST CAN CONSTRUCT POWERFUL MACHINES TO PERFORM VARIOUS TECHNIQUES, AND THE JOURNALIST CAN TAKE PICTURES OF THE MONSTERS, WHICH IS THE ONLY WAY TO GAIN MONEY IN THE GAME.</desc>

		<desc>LIBBLE RABBLE (?????? RIBURU RABURU) IS AN ARCADE GAME THAT WAS ORIGINALLY RELEASED BY NAMCO IN OCTOBER 1983. IT WAS DESIGNED BY TORU IWATANI, WHO HAD ALSO DESIGNED THE GEE BEE SERIES, PAC-MAN, AND POLE POSITION. IT IS A CURIOUS BUT CHALLENGING GAME, WHERE THE PLAYER TRIES TO HARVEST LITTLE MUSHROOMS (MUSHLINS) WHILE AVOIDING VARIOUS ENEMIES. IT WAS PORTED TO THE SUPER FAMICOM IN 1994.
AT FIRST GLANCE, THE GAMEPLAY RESEMBLES TAITO'S QIX. THE PLAYER CONTROLS TWO "ARROWS", ONE RED (LIBBLE) AND ONE BLUE (RABBLE) WITH A LINE STRUNG BETWEEN THEM. THE OBJECT IS TO WRAP THE LINE AROUND POLES AND SURROUND MUSHLINS AND ENEMIES WITH IT. THE PLAYER CAN EITHER CLOSE THE LOOPS THEMSELVES (WORTH MORE POINTS FOR THE MUSHLINS) OR MOVE BOTH ARROWS TO THE SAME EDGE OF THE SCREEN. THE PLAYER CLEARS A "SEASON" WHEN HE OR SHE HARVESTS ALL THE MUSHLINS.</desc>

A PUZZLE GAME SEEN FROM A TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE. THE GOAL OF EACH LEVEL IS TO OPEN THE EXIT BY PUSHING A MAGIC STONE ON A DESIGNATED SPOT. MAY CAN ALSO PUSH OBJECTS ONE TILE AHEAD WITHOUT MOVING HERSELF. THIS IS OFTEN USED TO GET THE STONE OVER WATER THAT SHE CAN'T CROSS HERSELF. MAY'S OTHER ABILITY IS TO CREATE MAGIC BUBBLES. SHE CAN CREATE BUBBLES IN THREE DIFFERENT SIZES. BUBBLES WILL POP AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME, DEPENDING ON THEIR SIZE. IF THEY POP WHILE NEXT TO THE STONE OR ANOTHER BUBBLE, THE STONE OR BUBBLE WILL BE MOVED ONE SPACE. SINCE MAY CAN CREATE SEVERAL BUBBLES SIMULTANEOUSLY, IT IS POSSIBLE, AND OFTEN NECESSARY, TO CREATE CHAIN REACTIONS TO MANEUVER THE STONE INTO THE DESIRED POSITION.

AS THE GAME PROGRESSES, LEVELS BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT AND NEW HAZARDS AND ENEMIES ARE INTRODUCED. ENEMIES FOLLOW A SET MOVEMENT PATTERN AND CAN SOMETIMES BE STOPPED, BUT NOT DESTROYED BY MAGIC BUBBLES. LATER LEVELS ARE MADE MORE COMPLICATED BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF TILES INCLUDING: GRASS THAT SLOWS DOWN MAY, ICE THAT MAY AND THE MAGIC STONE WILL SLIP OVER, SPIKES THAT DESTROY THE STONE IF IT IS PUSHED INTO THEM, COLLAPSING TILES THAT CAN ONLY BE WALKED OVER ONCE, RUNE TILES ON WHICH MAY CANNOT CREATE MAGIC BUBBLES, TELEPORTERS AND OTHERS.</desc>

		<desc>LITTLE MASTER: NIJIIRO NO MASEKI ("LITTLE MASTER: JEWELS OF THE RAINBOW") IS A STRATEGY RPG AND THE THIRD GAME IN THE SERIES. THE FIRST TWO GAMES, LITTLE MASTER RAIKUBAAN NO DENSETSU AND LITTLE MASTER 2: KAMINARI HIKARI NO KISHI, WERE EXCLUSIVE TO THE GAME BOY. SET TWO YEARS AFTER THE EVENTS OF LITTLE MASTER 2, THE HEROES - SWORDSMAN RIIM, MINOTAUR BRAWLER MORMOR AND HEALING MAGE TAMTAM - RESCUE A GOATMAN FROM A CAVE-IN, WHICH SETS OFF ANOTHER SERIES OF BATTLES AGAINST OLD FOES THE SKULL BOMBERS AND OTHER VILLAINS.

THE GAME IS STRUCTURALLY SIMILAR TO INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS'S FIRE EMBLEM OR CAMELOT'S SHINING FORCE SERIES: PLAYERS MOVE CHARACTERS AROUND A GRID, FIGHTING ENEMIES IN RANGE VIA CUTAWAYS THAT SHOWS THE TWO CHARACTERS EXCHANGING BLOWS ON A 2D PLANE. PLAYERS NEED TO BE WARY OF COUNTERATTACKS FROM ENEMIES AND GETTING SURROUNDED BY ENEMY UNITS ON THE TACTICAL MAP, AS BOTH MIGHT LEAD TO AN ALLIED CHARACTER GETTING ELIMINATED FROM BATTLE. THE PLAYER CAN ALSO INVESTIGATE HOUSES ON THE BATTLE MAP TO POTENTIALLY EARN ITEMS AND RECRUIT NEW CHARACTERS.

THE OFFERS TWO DIFFICULTIES: NORMAL AND ADVANCED. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THAT EXPERIENCE GAIN IS A LOT SLOWER ON ADVANCED, FORCING THE PLAYER TO CONSIDER HOW TO SPREAD AROUND THE FINITE AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE BETWEEN THEIR UNITS. THE GAME WAS NOT OFFICIALLY LOCALIZED, BUT A FEW PARTIAL FAN TRANSLATIONS EXIST.</desc>

THOSE STORIES APPEAR TO HAVE NO COMMON POINTS, YET AFTER COMPLETING ALL OF THEM, YOU'LL SEE THEY ARE IN FACT CONNECTED - THE WORLDS OF ALL THOSE CHARACTERS ARE THREATENED BY THE SAME ULTIMATE EVIL FORCE.

THE COMBAT FEATURES MANY INNOVATIONS COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL CONSOLE RPGS: YOUR POSITION ON THE BATTLE FIELD IS IMPORTANT, AND CERTAIN TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED ONLY FROM CERTAIN POSITIONS, AND ENEMY ATTACKS ALSO AFFECT ONLY SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE FIELD. OUT OF THE SEVEN CHAPTERS, SOME HAVE MORE BATTLE-ORIENTED GAMEPLAY, WHILE OTHERS ARE MORE DEVOTED TO PUZZLE-SOLVING AND INFORMATION-GATHERING.

		<desc>ONE OF THE SEVERAL VIDEO GAMES BASED ON RYO MIZUNO'S FANTASY NOVELS, THIS VERSION OF RECORD OF LODOSS WAR DOES NOT FOLLOW THE MAIN PLOT OF THE NOVELS, BUT IS INSTEAD DEDICATED TO AN IMPORTANT EPISODE FROM THE HISTORY OF LODOSS: THE BATTLE OF SIX HEROES AGAINST THE DEMON GOD. 

THE INTRODUCTION SHOWS THE SIX HEROES IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CONFRONTATION. FLAUS, THE PRIESTESS OF VALIS, IS SLAIN IN BATTLE. THE HERO BELD, ENRAGED, INVOKES A DEMONIC POWER TO DEFEAT THE GOD. BUT WHEN THE BATTLE IS OVER, THE HEROES DISAPPEAR...

THE GAME BEGINS WITH KARLA THE GREY WITCH, ONE OF THE SIX HEROES, ALONE IN A STRANGE PLACE, HER POWERS LOST. AFTER COMPLETING KARLA'S SCENARIO, THE PLAYER IS TAKEN TO THE SCENARIOS OF THE OTHER HEROES, AND FINALLY FINDS OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL OF THEM.

RECORD OF LODOSS WAR IS A JAPANESE-STYLE RPG WITH TOP-DOWN NAVIGATION, WORLD MAP, AND RANDOMLY APPEARING ENEMIES. HOWEVER, THE BATTLES HAVE A STRATEGIC EDGE, ALLOWING THE CHARACTERS TO MOVE ON THE BATTLE FIELD FREELY. THE BATTLES TAKE PLACE ON AN ISOMETRIC SCREEN. CHARACTERS CAN ALSO ACQUIRE UNIQUE ABILITIES, SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE KARLA'S ABILITY TO POSSESS BODIES OF OTHER PEOPLE.</desc>

		<desc>A SEQUEL TO MARIO'S PICROSS ON THE GAMEBOY, MARIO'S SUPER PICROSS FEATURES THE SAME GAMEPLAY AS ITS PREDECESSOR. THE GAME IS PLAYED SLAB OF STONE WITH A GRID ON IT. ABOVE OF EVERY COLUMN AND NEXT TO EVERY ROW ARE NUMBERS THAT ACTS AS CLUES AS TO WHERE A FILLED SQUARE IS LOCATED ALONG THAT COLUMN OR ROW. THE POINT OF THE GAME IS TO FIND ALL THE FILLED SQUARES ON THE GRID BY USING YOUR HAMMER AND CHISELING OUT SQUARES THAT YOU THINK ARE FILLED AND MARKING THOSE THAT AREN'T WITH X.

THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT SETS OF PUZZLES AVAILABLE BUT YOU START OFF WITH ONLY ONE, MARIO'S PICROSS, AND WHEN YOU COMPLETED THE FIRST LEVEL, WARIO WILL POP IN AND OFFER YOU HIS SET OF PUZZLES. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THAT MARIO'S PICROSS HAVE TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME. EVERY TIME YOU CHISEL OUT THE WRONG SQUARE, IT WILL DEDUCT TIME. IF TIME RUNS OUT BEFORE YOU CAN SOLVE THE PUZZLE, IT'S GAME OVER. WARIO'S PICROSS ARE TIMED TO SEE HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE YOU TO COMPLETE IT, BUT WILL NOT RUN OUT. THE CATCH HERE IS THAT YOU WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED OF A WRONG SQUARE.

OTHER FEATURES INCLUDES GAME-SAVES, HINTS AND TUTORIALS.</desc>

		<desc>THE HERO OF THE GAME IS FRON, A SIXTEEN-YEAR OLD BOY WHO LIVES ON THE ISLAND OF MONSTANIA. ONE DAY, STROLLING IN THE FOREST, HE NOTICES A STRANGE LIGHT. THE LIGHT LEAD HIM TO A CLEARING, AND THEN SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED. BUT FRON REALIZED WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF THAT LIGHT - IT WAS A FAIRY! OF COURSE, EVERYBODY KNEW THAT FAIRIES HAD BEEN LONG EXTINCT, BUT FRON NEVER BELIEVED IN THAT. ALL HIS LIFE HE WANTED TO MEET A REAL FAIRY, AND NOW, WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY HAS COME, HE FIRMLY DECIDES TO FIND HER. HIS GIRLFRIEND TIA HELPS HIM ON THE DANGEROUS JOURNEY, DURING WHICH THEY MEET A MYSTERIOUS LITTLE GIRL NAMED CHITTA, AND GET INVOLVED IN A GRAND ADVENTURE, THAT WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD THEM TO THE BATTLE AGAINST THE DARK FORCE THAT THREATENS THE WHOLE MONSTANIA!

"MONSTANIA" HAS A SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL GAMEPLAY WITHIN THE FRAMES OF CONSOLE RPGS. YOU DON'T EXPLORE THE WORLD IN THE GAME: IT IS ENTIRELY LINEAR AND TAKES YOU TO THE NEXT DESTINATION BY ITSELF (ONLY AT A FEW POINTS YOU CAN CHOOSE WHERE TO GO NEXT BY SELECTING AN APPROPRIATE ANSWER). ONCE WITHIN THE LOCATION, YOU CANNOT LEAVE IT UNTIL YOU COMPLETE ALL YOUR OBJECTIVES THERE, WHICH THEN TAKE YOU TO THE NEXT LOCATION. THE OBJECTIVE IS USUALLY A LARGE STRATEGIC BATTLE. YOU NAVIGATE YOUR PARTY MEMBERS ON THE BATTLE FIELD, ATTACK WITH MELEE AND LONG-RANGED WEAPONS, AND USE SPECIAL TECHNIQUE WHICH REQUIRE ACTION POINTS. UNLIKE MOST OTHER TURN-BASED STRATEGY GAMES, AN ENEMY MAKES A MOVE IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU DID THE SAME WITH ONE OF YOUR CHARACTERS, WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE "ENEMY TURN". THE RPG ELEMENT IS NOT VERY SIGNIFICANT: YOUR CHARACTERS LEVEL UP AUTOMATICALLY AFTER EACH BATTLE. THERE ARE ALSO SOME PUZZLES TO SOLVE IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS.</desc>

HIS ONLY WISH IS TO SURPASS HIS FATHER AND TO SHOW HIM HE HAS BECOME A BETTER FIGHTER THAN HIM. LAILA IS A CHEERFUL TREASURE HUNTER. SHE DREAMS ONLY OF VALUABLE THINGS, ADVENTURE, TRAVELS, AND LIFE IN THE CAPITAL CITY.  GAOU IS EXPERIENCING A PERSONAL TRAGEDY: HE WANTS TO DISCOVER THE MYSTERY OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF A WOMAN HE LOVED, ASUKA, AIDED BY HIS BEST FRIEND FROZ. NAAGA IS A GIRL WHO WEARS A HEAVY ARMOR, WHICH - AS SHE THINKS - WILL PREVENT HER FROM LOSING ANY BATTLE. AT PRESENT, SHE HAS PROBLEMS SINCE SHE OWES A MILLION GOLD PIECES TO HER GUILD. WHAT DO THOSE HEROES HAVE IN COMMON? AS THEIR WAYS CROSS, THEY WILL FIND OUT THEY ARE IN FACT PURSUING ONE AND THE SAME GOAL...

"BURNING HEROES" LETS YOU START AS EITHER ONE OF THE FOUR CHARACTERS. EACH ONE STARTS IN A DIFFERENT PLACE AND IS SEEMINGLY ABSORBED IN HIS/HER PERSONAL QUEST, BUT AS THE GAME PROGRESSES, THE FOUR HEROES MEET EACH OTHER. YOU SHOULD ALSO FIND AND "UNLOCK"  FOUR OTHER PLAYABLE CHARACTERS AS YOU ADVANCE IN THE GAME. THE GAMEPLAY SYSTEM OF "BURNING HEROES" IS SIMILAR TO OTHER CONSOLE-STYLE RPGS: YOU FIGHT RANDOM ENEMIES AND BOSSES IN TURN-BASED COMBAT, VIEWED FROM THIRD-PERSON PERSPECTIVE, LIKE IN  FINAL FANTASY GAMES. AS YOU GET HIT IN A BATTLE, YOUR "PASSION" (LITERALLY "HOT BLOOD", NEKKETSU IN JAPANESE) LEVEL RISES, AND THE MORE DAMAGE YOU TAKE, THE QUICKER YOU REACH 100%. ONCE THE PASSION BAR IS FULL, YOU CAN SUMMON A POWERFUL MONSTER AND TO UNLEASH A DEVASTATING ATTACK ON THE ENTIRE ENEMY PARTY.</desc>

		<desc>NICE DE SHOT IS A GOLF GAME FROM MAGICAL COMPANY, RELEASED ON THE SUPER FAMICOM IN 1994. THE GAME SUPPORTS UP TO TWO PLAYERS WHO COMPETE ON EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT COURSES. A SINGLE-PLAYER OPTION, IN WHICH THE PLAYER GOES THROUGH EACH COURSE SEQUENTIALLY, IS ALSO AVAILABLE. EACH COURSE TAKES PLACE IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE WORLD, AND TENDS TO INCLUDE UNUSUAL FEATURES LIKE ICE, STALAGMITES AND OTHER UNLIKELY OBSTACLES.

THE GAME USES A RUDIMENTARY POLYGONAL LANDSCAPE TO CONVEY THE LAY OF THE LAND TO THE PLAYER, THOUGH THIS INCREASES THE LOADING TIME IN MANY PARTS OF THE GAME AS THE TOPOGRAPHY HAS TO BE LOADED IN EVERY TIME IT SHIFTS, EITHER AFTER A SHOT OR WHILE ADJUSTING THE CAMERA TO AIM THE BALL A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.</desc>

		<desc>NICHIBUTSU ARCADE CLASSICS 2: HEIANKYO ALIEN IS A 1995 16-BIT REMASTER OF THE 1979 COMPUTER GAME HEIANKYO ALIEN. IT ALSO INCLUDES A RECREATION OF THE ORIGINAL 1979 GAME CONFIGURED TO WORK WITH THE SNES CONTROLLER. THE GAME REMAINS THE SAME: THE PLAYER, AS A HEIAN-ERA POLICEMAN, MUST DIG PITS TO CATCH CARNIVOROUS ALIENS AND THEN BURY THEM TO DESTROY THEM. IT TAKES THREE STEPS TO DIG A PIT BIG ENOUGH, AND ALIENS WILL QUICKLY FILL HOLES THAT AREN'T LARGE ENOUGH. IF AN ALIEN CATCHES THE POLICEMAN, HE WILL BE EATEN.NNNNTHE ENHANCED VERSION ADDS WOODEN BLOCKS THAT CAN BE CHOPPED DOWN, BUT THIS TAKES AS LONG AS DIGGING PITS AND PUTS THE PLAYER IN PERIL DURING THE TIME IT TAKES TO REMOVE THEM. THE GAME ALSO INCLUDES A TWO PLAYER VERSUS MODE THAT GIVES EACH PLAYER HALF THE SCREEN. WHEN AN ALIEN IS REMOVED FROM ONE PLAYER'S SIDE, IT APPEARS ON THE OTHER PLAYER'S SIDE, SO PLAYERS MUST QUICKLY REMOVE ALIENS SO THEY DON'T GET OVERWHELMED BY THE SHEER NUMBERS.</desc>

COMBOS WILL SEND LARGE GARBAGE BLOCKS TO YOUR OPPONENT, WHICH MUST BE ELIMINATED BY CLEARING A PIECE THAT IS TOUCHING IT, TURNING IT INTO NORMAL BLOCKS.

THE GAME OFFERS A STORY MODE AGAINST THE COMPUTER, AS WELL AS A 2-PLAYER VERSUS MODE, AN ENDLESS MODE, A TIMED MODE WHERE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BLOCKS MUST BE CLEARED, AND A PUZZLE MODE WHERE A SET ARRANGEMENT OF BLOCKS MUST BE CLEARED IN A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MOVES. THE GAME IS BASED ON THE JAPAN-ONLY TITLE PANEL DE PON.</desc>

		<name>Pipe Dream</name>
		<desc>EACH LEVEL OF THIS ABSTRACT PUZZLER CHALLENGES THE PLAYER TO SET UP A NETWORK OF PIPES TO ALLOW AN UNSPECIFIED SUBSTANCE KNOWN AS 'FLOOZ' TO FLOW THROUGH AS MANY OF THOSE AS POSSIBLE. THE PIECES ARE OFFERED IN RANDOM ORDER, AND THERE ARE SEVEN DIFFERENT TYPES - STRAIGHT LINES GOING HORIZONTALLY OR VERTICALLY, CORNERS ROTATING IN EACH OF THE FOUR DIRECTIONS, AND CROSS-OVER PIECES WHICH CARRY THE FLOOZ STRAIGHT ACROSS HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY. EACH OF THESE CAN BE ENTERED FROM EITHER SIDE. WHEN THE FLOOZ HITS A GAP, OR A PIECE WHICH THE PREVIOUS PIECE CAN'T FLOW INTO, THE PIPE IS FINISHED.

BEFORE THE FLOOZ STARTS FLOWING FROM ITS RANDOMLY-SELECTED STARTING POSITION, THE PLAYER HAS SEVERAL SECONDS TO START PLACING PIECES. THEY CAN BE PUT DOWN ANYWHERE. HOWEVER A SITUATION THAT CAN OFTEN OCCUR IS THERE WILL BE A LONG AND COMPLEX PIPING ARRANGEMENT SET UP, YET A GAP SOMEWHERE REMAINS TO BE FILLED. PLAYERS ARE ABLE TO  REPLACE A PIECE WITH ANOTHER IN THE SAME SQUARE (TO MAKE IT EASIER TO FLOW THE FLOOZ THAT WAY), BUT FOR A SLIGHT SCORING PENALTY.

BONUSES ARE AWARDED FOR LOOPING THE FLOOZ THROUGH BOTH SIDES OF AT LEAST 5 CROSS-OVER PIECES, OR PASSING THE FLOOZ THROUGH EVERY SQUARE ON THE SCREEN. LATER LEVELS HAVE SOME SQUARES ON THE GRID BLOCKED OFF, A FEW GAPS IN THE SIDE-WALL (ALLOWING FLOOZ TO THREAD TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN). AFTER EVERY FOUR LEVELS THERE IS A BONUS GAME FOR POINTS, IN WHICH THE PLAYER CAN ONLY PLACE THE PIECES IN THE LOWEST OPEN SPACE IN EACH COLUMN, SIMILARLY TO THE BOARD GAME OF "CONNECT 4".</desc>

O JOGO APRESENTA MUITOS PERSONAGENS DA ANIME, INCLUINDO A NOIVA DE RANMA (AKANE), O LUTADOR RYOUGA, A GUERREIRA AMAZÔNICA SHAMPOO, QUE ESTÁ APAIXONADA POR RANMA E OUTROS. O JOGO É CONSTRUÍDO COMO UM RPG JAPONÊS TRADICIONAL: SUA LUTA CONTRA INIMIGOS ALEATÓRIOS EM UM COMBATE BASEADO EM TERCEIRA PESSOA COMO FINAL FANTASY. EM BATALHAS, VOCÊ PODE ATACAR FISICAMENTE, OU USAR VÁRIAS TÉCNICAS OFENSIVAS E DEFENSIVAS, QUE CONSOMEM "KI" (UM EQUIVALENTE DE PONTOS MÁGICOS). NÃO SÓ RANMA E GENMA, MAS TAMBÉM OS OUTROS PERSONAGENS E SUAS FORMAS AMALDIÇOADAS. VOCÊ CARREGA UM BALDE DE ÁGUA FRIA, E TODA VEZ QUE VOCÊ O USA EM UM DE SEUS PERSONAGENS, ELE OU ELA, É TRANSFORMADO EM UMA FORMA "AMALDIÇOADA". ISSO AS VEZES É NECESSÁRIO PARA AVANÇAR NA HISTÓRIA DO JOGO (POR EXEMPLO, RANMA SÓ PODE ENTRAR EM UM DETERMINADO LOCAL SE FOR COMO UMA MENINA).</desc>

		<desc>ANOTHER FIGHTING GAME BASED ON THE RANMA 1/2 MANGA SERIES SET AROUND THE MISADVENTURES OF A MARTIAL ARTIST THAT GETS CURSED AND MAGICALLY TRANSFORMS INTO A FEMALE VERSION OF HIMSELF WHENEVER HE'S SPLASHED WITH WATER.

AS IN PREVIOUS GAMES THE PREMISE SIMPLY INVOLVES THE CAST OF THE SERIES GOING AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS FOR ULTIMATE SUPREMACY, ALTHOUGH THIS TIME YOU CAN SELECT ANY CHARACTER IN EITHER THE SINGLE PLAYER OR VS GAMEPLAY MODES.

THE GAMEPLAY ITSELF INVOLVES CONTROLLING YOUR CHARACTER IN A SIDE-SCROLLING ARENA AND TRYING TO DEFEAT YOUR OPPONENT EITHER WITH YOUR BASIC ATTACKS, SPECIAL MOVES (TRIGGERED BY SPECIFIC CONTROLLER MOTIONS) OR SUPER MOVES THAT REQUIRE YOU TO CHARGE BUTTONS AND CAN ONLY BE DEALT UNDER SPECIFIC SITUATIONS (IE, WHEN YOUR LIFE-BAR STARTS FLASHING), WHILE AVOIDING YOUR OPPONENT'S ATTACKS IN TURN.</desc>

		<desc>THE GAME INVOLVES FALLING BLOCKS OF HANDS DISPLAYING THE ROCK, PAPER, AND SCISSORS SIGNS, WHICH FALL THREE AT A TIME. IN A SIMILAR MANNER TO TETRIS, THE PLAYER CAN ROTATE THE BLOCKS TO STACK THEM, USING PIECES THAT DEFEAT OTHER PIECES (E.G. PAPER OVER ROCK) TO ELIMINATE STACKS. DOING SO ADDS GARBAGE PIECES ONTO THE OPPONENT'S SCREEN TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO ELIMINATE THEIR STACKS OF BLOCKS. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO FILL UP THE OPPONENT'S SCREEN UP WITH BLOCKS SO THAT ADDITIONAL ONES CAN NO LONGER FIT. EACH CHARACTER HAS TWO SPECIAL ATTACKS WHICH CAN BE USED WHEN LARGE COMBINATIONS ARE COMPLETED. ONCE IN EACH ROUND EACH PLAYER CAN ALSO USE A BUCKET OF WATER THAT CAN TRANSFORM A CURSED CHARACTER INTO THEIR ALTERNATE FORM, WHICH WEAKENS THEIR ATTACKS UNTIL THE EFFECT WEARS OFF. THIS DOES NOT AFFECT AKANE OR THE GAMBLING KING.</desc>

ROMANCING SAGA IS THE FOURTH INSTALLMENT IN THE LONG SAGA SERIES - NON-LINEAR ROLE-PLAYING GAMES WITH SEVERAL MAIN HEROES. IT IS THE FIRST OF THREE SUPER NINTENDO ENTRIES. THE FIRST THREE GAMES IN THE SERIES WERE ON THE GAMEBOY AND WERE KNOWN AS "FINAL FANTASY LEGEND" OUTSIDE OF JAPAN. IN THIS GAME, YOU PLAY THE STORIES OF EIGHT CHARACTERS, WHICH WILL LATER UNITE TO FACE THE ULTIMATE EVIL. THE EIGHT CHARACTERS BELONG TO DIFFERENT CLASSES AND HAVE DIFFERENT ABILITIES. THERE ARE FOUR MALE CHARACTERS (NOBLE SON, THIEF, ADVENTURER, AND PIRATE), AND FOUR FEMALE ONES (NOMAD, RANGER, DANCER, AND SAVAGE). THE COMBAT IS TURN-BASED, WITH ENEMIES VISIBLE ON SCREEN. TAKING A CUE FROM FINAL FANTASY II ON THE NES, INSTEAD OF "LEVELING" YOUR CHARACTER AS A WHOLE YOU LEVEL SPECIFIC ABILITIES SUCH AS A TYPE OF WEAPON OR MAGIC, AS WELL AS, STATS SUCH AS HP AND STRENGTH AND INTELLIGENCE. NEW TO THIS ENTRY ABILITIES ARE RANDOMLY UNLOCKED DURING BATTLE AS A LIGHT-BULB APPEARS OVER THE CHARACTERS HEAD AND THE NEW ABILITY IS UNLEASHED TO THE SURPRISE OF FRIEND AND FOE. THIS SERENDIPITOUS ELEMENT OF GAMEPLAY ALONG WITH THE MULTIPLE HEROES TO CHOOSE FROM GREATLY ENHANCE THE REPLAY VALUE AS NO TWO PLAYTHROUGHS ARE ALIKE. WHICH IS GOOD CONSIDERING THE STEEP LEARNING CURVE OF THE SAGA GAMES WHICH REQUIRE MULTIPLE PLAYTHROUGHS TO TRULY MASTER THE SYSTEM.

		<desc>THE EARTH IS RULED BY HEAVENLY POWERS, WHO DESTROY IT AND CREATE IT AGAIN EVERY 4000 YEARS, TO END THE LIVE OF POWERFUL RACES AND TO LET NEW ONES APPEAR. MANY YEARS AGO, FOUR GREAT RACES DOMINATED THE EARTH: THE WISE DANANS, THE BEAUTIFUL MERMAIDS, THE PROUD REPTILES, AND THE STRONG GIANTS. BUT THOSE RACES HAD TO GIVE PLACE TO A NEWLY BORN RACE: THE HUMANS. DURING THE ERA OF THE HUMANS, THE PLANET'S AIR HAS BECOME FILLED WITH SMOG AND THE WATER DIRTY WITH POLLUTANTS. THE CULT OF THE RUDRA HAVE APPEARED AND BEGUN FORTELLING THE END OF THE WORLD. AS THE 4000 YEAR DEADLINE APPROACHES, THREE CHARACTERS EACH EMBARK ON THEIR SEPARATE YET INTERTWINED QUESTS.

SION IS A YOUNG WARRIOR WHO WANTS TO TAKE PART IN A RITUAL TOURNAMENT AND BECOME THE STRONGEST OF THE KINGDOM. HOWEVER A CAPTURE OF ONE OF THE CULTISTS OF RUDRAS SOON COMPLICATES HIS TRAINING.

SURLET IS A WISE MAGICIAN WHO IS INTERESTED IN ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY OF THE EARTH. HE IS ALSO A PUPIL OF THE FAMOUS PROFESSOR MUENCH WHO RECENTLY MADE A VERY IMPORTANT DISCOVERY REGARDING ANCIENT RUINS

RIZA IS A YOUNG DRUID WHO LIVES WITH HER GRANDFATHER IN A QUIET VILLAGE. SHE WAS BORN WITH A MYSTERIOUS JADE ON HER FOREHEAD, AND NOW FEELS THE URGE TO SAVE THE WORLD FROM AN INEVITABLE, YET UNKNOWN DISASTER.

RUNDRA NO HIHO IS A TURN-BASED RPG, SIMILAR IN GAMEPLAY AND GRAPHICS TO THE BETTER KNOWN FINAL FANTASY VI. WHENEVER PLAYERS LOAD THE GAME CARTRIDGE, THEY ARE ABLE TO  CHOOSE WHICH OF THE THREE CHARACTERS THEY WISH TO PLAY. THIS ALLOWS ANY ONE OF THESE QUESTS TO BE SAVED AND PUT ASIDE FOR ANY AMOUNT OF TIME, ALLOWING THE PLAYER TO CHANGE BETWEEN CHARACTERS AS THEY SO DESIRE. REGARDLESS OF WHICH CHARACTER IS CHOSEN, THE GAME IS DISPLAYED AS A TOP-VIEW ON THE OVERWORLD AND IN TOWNS. PLAYERS CAN MOVE AROUND TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, SEARCH TREASURE CHESTS AND TALK TO TOWNSPEOPLE. ON THE OVERWORLD AND IN DUNGEONS, RANDOM ENCOUNTERS CAN OCCUR. DURING BATTLES THE GAME IS DISPLAYED FROM A SIDE-VIEW AND IS TURN-BASED BETWEEN THE PLAYER'S CHARACTERS AND MONSTERS. PLAYERS ARE ABLE TO FIGHT WITH THEIR WEAPON, USE MANTRAS (MAGIC), USE ITEMS, DEFEND OR RUN AWAY. DEFEAT OF MONSTERS WILL RESULT IN THE PARTY EARNING EXPERIENCE POINTS AND MONEY, WHICH CAN BE SPENT TO BUY NEW WEAPONS, ARMOR AND ITEMS.

THE GAME'S MANTRA (MAGIC) SYSTEM IS UNIQUE IN THAT ALL SPELLS ARE FORMED UP OF SYLLABLES, EACH WITH IT'S OWN EFFECT (FOR INSTANCE, THE SYLLABLE "IG" REPRESENTS FIRE AND THE SYLLABLE "GA" AUGMENTS ANY MANTRA'S POWER OVER IT'S BASIC FORM. THEREFORE "IGGA" IS A MORE POWERFUL VERSION THAN "IG" ALONE). SYLLABLES MUST BE ARRANGED IN PROPER COMBINATIONS IN ORDER TO FORM EFFECTIVE MAGIC SPELLS. HINTS TOWARDS SOME OF THESE COMBINATIONS CAN BE FOUND INSIDE TREASURE CHESTS OR BY TALKING TO TOWNSPEOPLE.</desc>

KARATE), ALONG WITH A FEW NEW CHARACTERS: TAKUMA SAKAZAKI, RYO AND YURI'S FATHER; YURI SAKAZAKI, TAKUMA'S DAUGHTER AND RYO'S SISTER; EIJI KISARAGI, A SWORN ENEMY OF THE SAKAZAKIS; TEMJIN, A MONGOLIAN TRUCKER; AND A YOUNGER VERSION OF GEESE HOWARD, WHOM YOU FACE AS THE LAST BOSS IF YOU BEAT THE GAME WITHOUT LOSING A ROUND.</desc>

THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS ARE DRAWN IN THE "DEFORMED" ANIME STYLE. THERE'S NO DIFFERENT FORMATIONS TO CHOOSE FROM, BUT ALL THE PLAYERS (EXCEPT THE GOALKEEPER) CAN BE POSITIONED ANYWHERE IN THE FIELD. DURING A FOOTBALL MATCH, AN ANIMATED IMAGE WILL APPEAR WHENEVER A GOAL IS SCORED. ONE OF THE PARTICULARITIES OR FLAWS OF THIS SOCCER GAME IS THAT DURING THE PENALTY SHOOT-OUT, THE GOALKEEPER CAN MOVE AND JUMP BEFORE THE RIVAL PLAYER ACTUALLY KICKS THE BALL.</desc>

THE ETERNAL REBEL KUNIO AND HIS PAL RIKI FINALLY GET TO FACE THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW WHEN THEY GET BOTH ARRESTED FOR KILLING A COUPLE OF BYSTANDERS IN A HIT-AND-RUN INCIDENT. PROBLEM IS THEY ARE INNOCENT AND   THE LOOKALIKE KILLERS ARE STILL OUT THERE! KUNIO AND HIS PAL NOW HAVE TO BREAK OUT OF THE PRISON AND GO KICK SOME BUTT IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE (AND TO CLEAR THEIR NAMES OF COURSE).

GAMEPLAY INVOLVES DEFEATING ALL OPPONENTS USING YOUR ARSENAL OF ATTACKS AND SPECIAL MOVES (AS WELL AS ANY WEAPONS YOU MAY FIND AROUND) AND COMPLETING THE MANY SIDE SCROLLING STAGES THAT MAKE UP THE GAME, USUALLY AFTER BEATING AN END LEVEL BOSS.

KUNIO AND RIKI ARE NOT ALONE IN THEIR QUEST, AS THEIR HARD BOILED GIRLFRIENDS, MISAKO AND KYOUKO, CAN JOIN UP AND PROVIDE THEIR UNIQUE COLLECTION OF SPECIAL MOVES TO THE MIX. BIKING SEQUENCES IN WHICH YOU TRY TO GET TO ANOTHER PART OF TOWN WHILE FENDING-OFF OPPONENTS  ROAD RASH-STYLE ARE ALSO ADDED FOR ADDITIONAL GAMEPLAY AND THE GAME USES SEVERAL NON-INTERACTIVE CUTSCENES AND DIALOGUES TO CARRY THE PLOT FORWARD.</desc>

		<desc>A CADA 100 ANOS, AS FORÇAS DO BEM ESTÃO MISTERIOSAMENTE ENFRAQUECIDAS. DURANTE ESTE PERÍODO, O PODER DE DRACULA COMEÇOU A RESSURGIR, TORNANDO-SE MAIS E MAIS FORTE. DRACULA REVIVEU MUITAS VEZES; NO ENTANTO, SUAS AÇÕES SINISTRAS FORAM CONSTANTEMENTE INTERROMPIDAS PELA FAMÍLIA BELMONT.

FAZ 100 ANOS DESDE O ÚLTIMO CONFRONTO, E AGORA, A TRANQUILIDADE DA TRANSILVÂNIA É NOVAMENTE AMEAÇADA PELAS FORÇAS DAS TREVAS. 

É O ANO DE 1691. EM UMA NOITE ESCURA ESCURA, DRÁCULA RESSUSCITOU DENTRE OS MORTOS, MERGULHANDO A TERRA DA EUROPA EM UM ESTADO DE ESCURIDÃO TOTAL. AS LEGIÕES DO CONDE CRESCERAM COMO UMA PRAGA, INFESTANDO A TERRA COMO UMA DOENÇA ONDE QUER QUE FOSSEM. SIMON BELMONT, O BISNETO DE CHRISTOPHER BELMONT, FOI AQUELE QUE OUVIU OS GRITOS DO POVO. ARMADO COM O LENDÁRIO CHICOTE VAMPIRE KILLER, ELE INICIARÁ UMA JORNADA PARA CASTLEVANIA, A CASA ANCESTRAL DO PRÍNCIPE DAS TREVAS. SUA MISSÃO É BEM CLARA. ENVIE O CONDE DE VOLTA A SUA SEPULTURA ESCURA, PARA SALVAR O MUNDO DE SEU TORMENTO ETERNO.</desc>

		<desc>SUPER CHINESE FIGHTER IS A ONE-ON-ONE FIGHTER GAME FOR THE SUPER FAMICOM AND THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF THREE FIGHTER GAMES BASED ON THE SUPER CHINESE FRANCHISE FROM CULTURE BRAIN.

IN THE ADVENTURE MODE, LIN-LIN IS CAPTURED BY KYONKYONSHI, A JIANG SHI, AND THE TWO BROTHERS ARE FORCED TO RESCUE HER. THIS MODE PUNCTUATES STORY SCENES WITH FIGHTS AGAINST CPU OPPONENTS, AND ALSO ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO ACQUIRE CONSUMABLE ITEMS AND USE THEM WHERE NECESSARY.

THE GAME ALSO HAS A SURVIVAL "CIRCUIT" MODE AND THE STANDARD HUMAN VS. HUMAN VERSUS MODE.</desc>

		<desc>?IN THIS SIDESCROLLING ACTION-PLATFORMER, BONK IS ONCE AGAIN TRYING TO SAVE HIS WORLD FROM THE EVIL CLUTCHES OF THE REPTILIAN KING, WHO ONCE MORE IS THREATENING THE PREHISTORIC ERA.  BOY, YOU'D THINK THAT AFTER BEING DEFEATED FOUR TIMES PRIOR THAT HE WOULD TAKE A HINT.  THIS TIME, YOU ALSO GET TO FACE HIS FIVE BEST SOLDIERS, WHO WILL TRY TO STOP YOU IN YOUR TRACKS.  BONK CONTROLS RATHER SMOOTHLY, AND HE IS REALLY FUN TO CONTROL.  TO THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE SERIES, BONK IS A CAVEMAN WHO ATTACKS HIS ENEMIES WITH HIS NOGGIN; AFTER JUMPING DOWN, FROM BELOW, WHILE SWIMMING, AND WHILE IN THE AIR.  HE CAN EVEN BOUNCE OFF WALLS WITH HIS HEAD, SKIP ON THE WATER LIKE A STONE IF HIS HEAD IS FACING DOWN, CLIMB CERTAIN WALLS WITH HIS TEETH, SCALE UP WATERFALLS, FLIP IN THE AIR (SO LONG AS THE ATTACK BUTTON IS REPEATEDLY BEING TAPPED), AND SO FORTH.  AS IS THE CASE WITH THE SERIES, YOU START WITH A REGULAR AMOUNT OF HEALTH, BUT IF YOU FIND A TRANSLUCENT HEART ICON, YOU'LL INCREASE YOUR CAPACITY.  WHAT'S NEAT IS HOW COLLECTING THE FOOD NOT ONLY SCORES YOU SOME POINTS BUT HOW IT ALSO REPLENISHES A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR HEALTH, TOO.  THIS TIME BONK CAN ALSO RUN IF YOU HOLD DOWN THE A BUTTON, AND THE X BUTTON IS USED IF YOU HAVE A SPECIAL ABILITY ON YOU.  IF YOU FIND A POWER-UP, WHETHER IT BE PIECE OF MEAT, OR A DIFFERENT ICON, THEN YOU WILL BE GIVEN A POWER-UP ABILITY THAT WILL BE TAKEN OUT THE MOMENT YOU'RE HIT ONCE (DAMN).  AMONG THE POWER-UPS ARE THE ONE WHERE THE FIRE WILL BE SPREADING IF BONK HITS HIS HEAD ON THE GROUND (YOU KNOW, THE ONE WHERE HE LOOKS FREAKY), ONE WHERE BONK TURNS INTO A BIRD AND GAINS THE ABILITY TO FLY, ONE WHERE BONK BECOMES TINY AND CAN MAKE PLATFORMS MADE OUT OF JAPANESE CHARACTERS, AND THERE IS ONE WHERE BONK HAS THE ABILITY TO DOUBLE-JUMP AS A GIRL.  YES, BONK BECOMES A GIRL IF HE EATS THE PINK-COLORED MEAT.  I'M DEAD SERIOUS.</desc>

THE GAME ALSO FEATURES A NEW "PUZZLE MODE" WHICH PLAYS SIMILARLY TO THOSE FOUND IN TETRIS SEQUELS: THE PLAYER HAS A LIMITED NUMBER OF PRE-DETERMINED PIECES AND MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THEM TO GET THEIR LITTLE BALD FRIEND TO THE END.</desc>

		<desc>SUPER GUSSUN OYOYO IS AN EXTREMELY CUTE ACTION/PUZZLE GAME BY BANPRESTO, AND CONVERSION OF IREM'S ARCADE GAME OF THE SAME NAME ORIGINALLY RELEASED IN 1993. THE GAME IS AN INTERESTING AND UNIQUE CROSSOVER BETWEEN THE 'PUZZLY' SIDE OF TETRIS AND THE 'SAVE ALL THE RODENTS' SIDE OF LEMMINGS. THE GOAL OF THE GAME IS TO GUIDE A BALD AND FUN LOOKING CREATURE, WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE A TREASURE HUNTER CALLED GUSSUN (AND HIS FRIEND OYOYO IN TWO PLAYERS MODE), TO THE LEVEL'S EXIT. THIS CHARACTER JUST KEEPS WALKING AROUND AND GETS SCARED AT THE SILLIEST THINGS. WHILE HE AIMLESSLY WANDERS AROUND THE PLAYFIELD, TETRIS LIKE PIECES FALL FROM THE TOP OF THE SCREEN, AND THE PLAYER MUST ROTATE AND POSITION THEM IN THE SCENE. ONCE IN PLACE, THESE BLOCKS CAN BE USED BY GUSSUN TO CLIMB ON TO REACH NEW AREAS, AND EVENTUALLY LEAD HIM THROUGH THE EXIT DOOR. TONS OF OTHER FEATURES ARE ALSO PACKED WITH THE GAME, SUCH AS BOMBS OR LITTLE BUDDIES WHO FOLLOW GUSSUN TO THE EXIT (COLLECT 10 OF THEM FOR AN EXTRA LIFE!). TIME IS OF COURSE LIMITED AND WATER STARTS FILLING UP THE STAGE IF PLAYERS STAY IN ONE LEVELS FOR TOO LONG. ADDITIONALLY, TRAPS AND MONSTERS SOON APPEAR AND THINGS GET QUICKLY TRICKY AND WILL SQUEEZE THE JUICE OUT OF THE PLAYER'S BRAIN IN NO TIME. AN INTENSE TWO-PLAYER VERSUS MODE AND A LEVEL EDITOR ARE ALSO AVAILABLE.</desc>

THE INTRO ESTABLISHES THAT THE EPONYMOUS SOKOBAN, OR WAREHOUSE WORKER, MUST PERFORM ENOUGH BOX-PUSHING PUZZLES TO EARN ENOUGH CASH FOR A FLASHY NEW CAR SO THAT HE MIGHT FINALLY IMPRESS THE GIRL OF HIS DREAMS.

AN ADDED WRINKLE IS THAT EACH STAGE HAS A FIXED MOVE LIMIT, AND SO THE PLAYER MUST NOT ONLY PUSH THE BOXES IN THE RIGHT ORDER BUT DO SO WITH MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY. THE GAME WAS NOT RELEASED OUTSIDE OF JAPAN.</desc>

RATHER THAN RELYING ON EXPLOSIVES, AS IS THE CASE IN THE STRUCTURALLY SIMILAR BOMBERMAN SERIES, EACH CHARACTER HAS A BALL AND CHAIN WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO DAMAGE OPPONENTS AND DESTROY BLOCKS. THEY CAN ACQUIRE BONUSES THAT INCREASES THE SIZE OF THE BALL, WHICH CAUSES IT TO DO MORE DAMAGE, AND THE LENGTH OF THE CHAIN, WHICH INCREASES ITS RANGE.

THE GAME FEATURES A SINGLE-PLAYER MODE WHERE THE PLAYER TAKES ONE OF THE FOUR PROTAGONISTS THROUGH A SERIES OF MAZE STAGES THAT CAN BE ATTEMPTED IN ANY ORDER, EACH OF WHICH CONCLUDES WITH A BOSS FIGHT. IT ALSO FEATURES A MULTIPLAYER MODE WHERE UP TO FOUR PLAYERS CAN COMPETE FOR SUPREMACY ACROSS A NUMBER OF STAGES.

		<desc>SUPER TETRIS 2 + BOMBLISS IS ONE OF THE MANY VERSIONS OF THE FAMOUS SOVIET PUZZLE GAME, THE FIRST ONE AVAILABLE FOR THE SUPER NINTENDO, AND AN UPDATED VERSION OF TETRIS 2 + BOMBLISS.

AS THE TITLE WOULD SUGGEST, THE GAME FEATURES BOTH STANDARD TETRIS AS WELL AS ANOTHER SIMILAR GAME CALLED BOMBLISS. TETRIS OFFERS THREE GAME MODES: STANDARD MARATHON (A-TYPE), START WITH GARBAGE (B-TYPE), AND RISING GARBAGE (C-TYPE). THERE IS ALSO A TWO-PLAYER VERSUS MODE WHERE CLEARING ROWS SENDS GARBAGE TO THE OTHER PLAYER.

BOMBLISS IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM NORMAL TETRIS. ARRANGED ON THE BOARD AND IN SOME DROPPED PIECES ARE BOMB SQUARES. COMPLETING A ROW DOES NOT CLEAR THE BLOCKS IN THE ROW, BUT WILL TRIGGER ANY BOMBS IN THE ROW WHICH WILL DESTROY BLOCKS. DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOMBS WILL GENERATE LARGER EXPLOSIONS. BOMBLISS IS OFFERED IN STANDARD MARATHON MODE, A PUZZLE MODE WHERE A SET BOARD MUST BE CLEARED USING SET PIECE DROPS, AND A 2-PLAYER VERSUS MODE.</desc>

		<desc>SUPER TETRIS 3 IS YET ANOTHER VERSION OF THE FAMOUS SOVIET PUZZLE GAME. HOWEVER, DESPITE WHAT THE TITLE MAY SUGGEST, CONTAINED WITHIN ARE ACTUALLY FOUR DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF TETRIS: TETRIS CLASSIC, FAMILISS, SPARKLISS, AND MAGICALISS. TETRIS CLASSIC, OF COURSE, IS THE BASIC VERSION OF THE GAME, WHICH COMES WITH AN ENDLESS MODE AND A 25-LINE "STANDARD" MODE. FAMILISS, AS THE NAME MIGHT SUGGEST, IS A FAMILY MODE FOR UP TO FOUR PLAYERS SIMULTANEOUSLY. SPARKLISS, MEANWHILE, IS VERY SIMILAR TO BOMBLISS FROM SUPER TETRIS 2, ONLY WITH A MEDIEVAL FANTASY THEME AND DIFFERENT EXPLOSION PATTERNS. SPARKLISS INCLUDES BOTH A STAGE MODE AND A PUZZLE MODE.

THE MOST UNIQUE MODE IS MAGICALISS, WHICH HAS NEVER SHOWN UP ON ANY OTHER VERSION OF TETRIS. IN MAGICALISS, PIECES COME IN THREE BASIC COLORS, AND BY ROTATING THE PIECE, THE PLAYER CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM. CREATING A LINE ENTIRELY OUT OF ONE COLOR WILL CLEAR ALL BLOCKS ON THE SCREEN OF THAT COLOR. THERE ARE ALSO GREY PIECES, WHICH CAN ONLY BE CLEARED BY CREATING A LINE MADE ENTIRELY FROM ONE COLOR, WHICH WILL CAUSE ALL GREY BLOCKS ON SCREEN TO BECOME THAT COLOR. THERE ARE ALSO RARE RAINBOW PIECES WHICH WILL ACT AS ANY COLOR. BESIDES THESE ADDITIONS, THE GAME ITSELF IS BASIC TETRIS.

TETRIS CLASSIC, SPARKLISS, AND MAGICALISS CAN ALSO BE PLAYED IN A TWO-PLAYER BATTLE MODE, BESIDES THE FOUR-PLAYER FAMILISS MODE.</desc>

		<desc>SUTTE HAKKUN IS A PUZZLE ACTION GAME IN THE SHAPE OF A PLATFORMER. THE PLAYING CHARACTER IS AN ABUNDANT-BEAKED BIRD RESEMBLING A PENGUIN, NAMED HAKKUN, THAT IS ABLE TO WALK AND JUMP BUT NOT TO FLY. THE RAINBOW OF HAPPINESS SHINED IN THE SKY ABOVE PEACEFUL ISLANDS: ONE DAY IT BROKE APART AND NOW HAKKUN HAS TO TRACK DOWN, COLLECT, AND PUT TOGETHER ALL RAINBOW CRYSTALS TO RELIVE IT. THE GAMEPLAY HINGES UPON TWO ELEMENTS: BLOCKS AND POTIONS, THE LATTER OF SEVERAL COLOURS. HAKKU MAKES ITS WAY THROUGH LEVELS BY CHANGING THE POSITION OF BLOCKS Â THAT WILL BE DONE BY SWALLOWING THEM TO RELEASE THEM ON AN OTHER PLACE THEN Â AND SUCKING POTIONS Â THAT ARE TO BE INJECTED TO BLOCKS BY THE BEAK, ENDOWING THEM WITH NEW PROPERTIES CONSEQUENTIAL TO THE COLOUR OF THE FLUID Â FROM JARS. A LEVEL IS CLEARED WHEN THE RAINBOW SHARDS IN IT ARE COLLECTED. NEITHER A TIME LIMIT NOR ENEMY CHARACTERS ARE THERE IMPEDING HAKKUN'S WAY. EQUALLY DISTINCTIVE IS THE SCORE SYSTEM: A SET NUMBER OF POINTS IS GIVEN AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH LEVEL, AND A DECREASE HAPPENS WITH ANY MOVE MADE, THUS REWARDING THE PLAYER FOR COMPLETING LEVELS WITH AS LITTLE MOVES AS POSSIBLE.

BEFORE REACHING THE FORMAT OF A COMMON SUPER FAMICOM CARTRIDGE, THE GAME WAS RELEASED FOR AND DOWNLOADABLE BY THE CONSOLE'S ADD-ON SATELLAVIEW IN FOUR VERSIONS. GIVEN DATA SIZE LIMITATIONS, ONLY ONE OF THE FOUR OF THOSE, RELEASED FOR USE WITH THE NINTENDO POWER CARTRIDGE, COULD INCLUDE ALL THE LEVELS DESIGNED BY GAME CREATORS: THAT IS THE ONE RELEASED AS A SUPER FAMICOM STANDARD CARTRIDGE LATER, AND ON WII'S VIRTUAL CONSOLE EVENTUALLY.</desc>

		<desc>TACTICAL SOCCER IS A SOCCER GAME PUBLISHED BY ELECTRONIC ARTS, ALTHOUGH IT WAS DEVELOPED BY A JAPANESE TEAM.

LIKE ZICO SOCCER, THE GAMEPLAY IS MORE REMINISCENT OF A STRATEGY GAME IN REAL TIME. IT TAKES PLACE BEFORE PLAYERS' EYES SO THE ACTION (WHICH IS REPRESENTED BY A SMALL WINDOW AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN) CAN'T BE INTERRUPTED.

EACH OF THE 16 NATIONAL TEAMS HAVE 16 PLAYERS WITH DIFFERENT SKILLS (RANGING FROM A TO E). DURING A MATCH, THE PLAYER GIVES DIRECTIONS SUCH AS FORCE AT THE CENTER, PLAY ON THE WINGS, BACK IN DEFENSE, TAKE A LONG OR SHORT PASS. DEPENDING ON WHAT THE PLAYER CHOOSES, IT IS POSSIBLE TO APPLY THE COMMAND TO A PARTICULAR PLAYER, THE PLAYER IN POSSESSION OF THE BALL, A PART OF THE TEAM (DEFENSE, MIDFIELD, ATTACK) OR THE WHOLE TEAM. EVERYTHING IS DONE RELATIVELY SIMPLY WITH COMBINATIONS OF BUTTONS.

THERE ARE NO HEADERS, BICYCLE KICKS OR OTHER FANCY MOVEMENTS, SCORING GOALS IS ONLY POSSIBLE BY KICKING THE BALL. A REPLAY IS PLAYED EVERY TIME A FAULT IS COMMITTED (WHICH HAPPEN QUITE OFTEN), A SHOT OFF TARGET IS MADE, OR A GOAL IS SCORED.</desc>

		<desc>SASAMI IS KIDNAPPED BY A MYSTERIOUS LITTLE GIRL WITH MAGICAL POWERS, AND TENCHI AND HIS COMPANIONS MUST TRAVEL TO RESCUE HER, BATTLING MONSTERS AND OTHER CREATURES ON THE WAY.

TENCHI MUYOU! GAME-HEN IS A STRATEGY GAME WITH RPG ELEMENTS, BASED ON THE POPULAR JAPANESE TENCHI MUYO! CARTOON SERIES. THE GAME MOVES FROM BATTLE TO BATTLE, WITH THE PLOT BEING REVEALED THROUGH CUTSCENES BETWEEN THEM. THE PLAYER FIGHTS THE COMPUTER ON TURNS, CONTROLLING THE INDIVIDUALS FROM A PARTY OF FOUR. THE PARTY MEMBERS ARE SELECTED ON A SEPARATE SCREEN BEFORE EACH BATTLE, AND AS THE GAME PROGRESSES NEW CHARACTERS BECOME AVAILABLE.

DURING THE SKIRMISH, SELECTING THE CHARACTERS BRINGS UP A MENU WITH THREE COMMAND OPTIONS: MOVE, ATTACK OR END TURN. A FOURTH TRANSFORM OPTION BECOMES AVAILABLE LATER, AFTER THEY REACH A HIGHER LEVEL. WHEN MOVING OR ATTACKING, GLOWING TILES ON THE GROUND SHOW THE MAXIMUM RANGE OF THE ACTION. PERFORMING EITHER ONE COSTS ACTION POINTS, SHOWN AS EIGHT REGENERATING GREEN DOTS ON THE STATUS WINDOW, ALONGSIDE BASIC STATISTICS LIKE HEALTH, DEFENSE AND ATTACK LEVELS. CHARACTERS LEVEL UP AUTOMATICALLY WHILE ON THE BATTLEFIELD, INCREASING THEIR ABILITIES AND RECEIVING MORE POWERFUL ATTACKS. HEALTH POWERS ARE ALSO ACCESSED THROUGH THE ATTACK MENU, RECOVERING LOST POINTS TO AN AILING COMRADE WITHIN THEIR RANGE. CHARACTERS CAN TRANSFORM TO A MORE POWERFUL VERSION WHEN THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO, AND ALL THE EIGHT GREEN DOTS ARE STILL AVAILABLE. THE TRANSFORMED UNIT HAS MORE POWERFUL ATTACKS AND A WIDER RANGE OF MOVEMENT.

AFTER THE BATTLE, A MAP SCREEN APPEARS WHERE THE PLAYER CAN SAVE THE GAME, AND CHOOSE THE NEXT BATTLE FROM ONE OF THE AVAILABLE PATHS. IT IS POSSIBLE TO REVISIT BATTLEGROUNDS, TO LEVEL UP BEFORE TACKLING STRONGER ENEMIES.</desc>

THE ARCADE VERSION IS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS "LAST FORTRESS".NNNNTHE GAME WAS FOLLOWED BY DAITORIDE ("GREAT FORTRESS") IN 1995. LIKE TORIDE IT WAS FIRST RELEASED IN THE ARCADE AND THEN TO A SINGLE HOME CONSOLE; IN THIS CASE THE SEGA SATURN.NNNNTHE PLAYER MUST CLEAR ALL THE TILES ON THE SCREEN, AS PER USUAL MAHJONG SOLITAIRE RULES, BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO THEY HAVE TO STORE MATCHING TILES ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. THE PLAYER'S "HAND" HAS A LIMITED NUMBER OF SLOTS AVAILABLE, AND IF THE PLAYER FILLS IT UP WITH PIECES THAT DON'T MATCH THEN THEY HAVE FAILED. THERE IS ALSO A TIMER FOR THE WHOLE ROUND THAT TICKS DOWN WHENEVER THE PLAYER IS DELIBERATING ON THEIR NEXT MOVE, AND REMOVING PAIRS OF PIECES FROM PLAY WILL SLIGHTLY REFILL IT. THERE ARE ALSO SPECIAL POWER-UP TILES THAT INCREASE THE TIMER.NNNNAS WITH MAHJONG SOLITAIRE, THE PLAYER CAN ONLY MATCH IDENTICAL TILES. THE EXCEPTION ARE THE EIGHT UNIQUE SEASON AND FLOWER TILES, WHICH CAN BE PAIRED OFF WITH ANY OTHER SEASON OR FLOWER (THOUGH IT HAS TO BE TWO SEASONS OR TWO FLOWERS).</desc>

		<name>Ushio to Tora</name>
		<desc>USHIO TO TORA ("USHIO AND TORA") IS A GAME BASED ON THE MANGA OF THE SAME NAME. IT FEATURES USHIO AOTSUKI, A YOUNG MAN WHO DISCOVERS THE POWERFUL BEAST SPEAR THAT HIS ANCESTOR USED TO TRAP A VICIOUS YOUKAI MONSTER CALLED TORA (JAPANESE FOR "TIGER"). RECOVERING THE SPEAR CAUSES NOT ONLY TORA TO BE FREE, BUT DRAWS MANY OTHER EVIL YOUKAI OUT FROM HIDING. TORA WORKS BEGRUDGINGLY WITH USHIO TO FIGHT BACK THE WAVE OF YOUKAI OUT OF FEAR OF THE SPEAR'S POWER (THOUGH AS THE MANGA PROGRESSES, TORA'S REASONS FOR HELPING BECOME MORE ALTRUISTIC).

THE GAME IS A SIDE-SCROLLING BRAWLER WITH SHORT STAGES THAT CULMINATE IN BOSS FIGHTS WITH OTHER YOUKAI, SIMILAR TO THE SUPER FAMICOM GEGEGE NO KITAROU GAME. THE PLAYER CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN USHIO AND TORA TO CONTROL, AND EACH CONTROLS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY: USHIO HAS GREATER RANGE WITH THE SPEAR AND CAN CREATE SHOCKWAVES, WHILE TORA IS A POWERHOUSE UP CLOSE WITH HIS CLAWS AND CAN SUMMON BOLTS OF LIGHTNING.</desc>

		<desc>THERE WAS ONCE A GREAT SCIENTIST AND INVENTOR NAMED GEPETTO, WHO LIVED ON AN ISLAND FARM TOGETHER WITH HIS CREATIONS, HIS ROBOTIC HELPER, THE PIXIE TINKER, AND HIS PET ANIMALS. HIS GREATEST CREATION WAS AN ARTIFICIAL BOY NAMED PINO. NO, HE WAS NOT CARVED FROM WOOD, BUT LOOKED JUST LIKE A REAL BOY - ONLY HE COULD TURN HIS HEAD 360 DEGREES. BUT GEPETTO WAS ARRESTED FOR AN UNKNOWN REASON. THE BOY PINO LOOKS LIKE A REAL BOY, BUT HE WAS COMPLETED JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO, AND HE KNOWS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. ALL HE CAN DO IS WANDER AIMLESSLY, POKING OBJECTS AND TURNING HIS HEAD. IT IS UP TO YOU, THE PLAYER, TO MAKE PINO A REAL MAN!

IN THIS SIMULATION/ROLE-PLAYING GAME, YOU MUST USE THE ROBOTIC PIXIE TINKER TO EDUCATE PINO. YOU CAN MOVE TINKER AROUND, EXAMINING OBJECTS AND COLLECTING THEM IN AN ADVENTURE-LIKE FASHION. PINO WILL AUTOMATICALLY FOLLOW YOU TO THE DIRECTION YOU ARE FACING, BUT WILL CONTINUE WALKING UNTIL YOU STOP HIM. HE WILL ALSO PICK OBJECTS AND MAKE HIS OWN "EXPERIMENTS" WITH THEM. YOUR GOAL IS TO TRAIN PINO IN VARIOUS DISCIPLINES. HIS STATS CAN BE RAISED IN A RPG STYLE: READING BOOKS INCREASES HIS INTELLIGENCE, THROWING A BALL INCREASES HIS DEXTERITY, AND SO ON. BY PRAISING OR SCOLDING PINO YOU WILL GRADUALLY MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND WHAT SHOULD BE DONE AND WHAT NOT.</desc>
