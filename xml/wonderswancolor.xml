THE GAMEPLAY IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THAT OF THE PREVIOUS GAME. YOU TRAVEL THROUGH TOP-DOWN AND ISOMETRIC LOCATIONS, FIGHTING MONSTERS WITH YOUR OWN MONSTER TEAM, AND THEN RECRUITING NEW MONSTERS AND ASSEMBLING A COLLECTION. THE BATTLES ARE TURN-BASED AND ARE VIEWED FROM AN ISOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE. THE MONSTERS HAVE VARIOUS KINDS OF ATTACKS IN THEIR DISPOSAL. EACH ATTACK IS SHOWN AS A SHORT ANIMATED SEQUENCE.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy IV</name>
		<desc>THIS IS THE FOURTH ENTRY IN THE FINAL FANTASY SERIES. IT WAS KNOWN AS FINAL FANTASY II INTERNATIONALLY, BECAUSE THE SECOND AND THIRD GAMES WERE NEVER RELEASED OUTSIDE OF JAPAN.

THE MILITARY COUNTRY OF BARON IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST IN THE LAND, WITH A PROUD ARMY AND A MAJESTIC AIR FORCE KNOWN AS THE RED WINGS. BUT, WHILE THEIR ARMIES ARE KIND AND LOYAL, THE RECENT ACTIONS OF THE KING ARE ANYTHING BUT. THE YOUNG CAPTAIN OF THE RED WINGS, CECIL, IS ORDERED TO STEAL A CRYSTAL FROM A VILLAGE OF INNOCENT MAGICIANS, AND WHEN HE QUESTIONS THE ACTIONS OF HIS KING, CECIL IS IMMEDIATELY THROWN OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND SENT OFF TO KILL STRANGE MONSTERS. LITTLE DOES HE REALIZE THE PRICE THE KING'S ACTIONS WILL PAY, AND WHAT THE TRUE SECRET OF THE CRYSTALS, AND THEIR POWERS, TRULY IS...

THIS IS THE FIRST FINAL FANTASY GAME THAT INTRODUCED THE FAMOUS ATB (ACTIVE-TIME BATTLE) SYSTEM: DURING THE BATTLES, YOU HAVE A TIME INDICATOR FOR EACH PARTY MEMBER THAT TELLS YOU WHEN THIS CHARACTER IS ABLE TO ACT. IF IT TAKES YOU TOO LONG TO SELECT A COMMAND FOR THIS CHARACTER, THE ENEMY WILL ACT WITHOUT WAITING FOR YOUR TURN. THE GAME ABANDONS THE JOB SYSTEM THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN THE FIRST AND THE THIRD GAME IN FAVOR OF PRE-SET CHARACTER CLASSES (PALADIN, WHITE MAGE, NINJA, ETC.) ASSIGNED TO EACH PARTY MEMBER.

THE PLAYSTATION VERSION ADDS A NEW RENDERED INTRO AND ENDING.</desc>

		<desc>HIRONOBU SAKAGUCHI'S FINAL FANTASY... THE FIRST OF ONE OF THE LONGEST ROLE-PLAYING GAME SERIES KNOWN TO MANKIND. FINAL FANTASY IS THE GAME FOR THE NES CONSOLE THAT STARTED IT ALL.

THE WORLD IS VEILED IN DARKNESS. WINDS DON'T BLOW, THE SEAS ARE STORMY, AND THE EARTH ROTS. ALL PEOPLE CAN HOPE FOR IS THAT THE ANCIENT PROPHECY WILL BE FINALLY FULFILLED. "WHEN THE WORLD IS VEILED IN DARKNESS, FOUR WARRIORS WILL COME..." AND INDEED, THEY COME - THE FOUR CHARACTERS YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY CHOSEN. THEIR FIRST QUEST IS TO FREE A PRINCESS FROM THE EVIL GARLAND, AND THEN THE REAL JOURNEY BEGINS...

FINAL FANTASY IS PLAYED WITH AN ADVENTURING PARTY RATHER THAN WITH A SINGLE CHARACTER. BEFORE THE GAME STARTS, THE PLAYER CHOOSES FOUR CHARACTERS FROM SIX DIFFERENT CLASSES: FIGHTER, THIEF, BLACK BELT, WHITE MAGE, RED MAGE, AND BLACK MAGE. WHICH FOUR CLASSES THE PLAYER CHOOSES FOR HIS CHARACTERS IS ENTIRELY UP TO HIM. HE ALSO GIVES THE CHARACTERS NAMES. 

IN THE GAME, THE PARTY WALKS AROUND IN A TOP-DOWN WORLD, VISITS CITIES, CAVES, PALACES AND OTHER PLACES TO BUY EQUIPMENT, REST AND GET HINTS AND NEW QUESTS, AND FIGHTS BADDIES WHEN THEY ARE ENCOUNTERED. FINAL FANTASY USES A TURN-BASED COMBAT SYSTEM; THE ATB (ACTIVE-TIME BATTLE) SYSTEM FROM THE LATER INSTALLMENTS IS NOT USED. IN BATTLE, THE PLAYER GIVES EACH CHARACTER IN ORDER A COMMAND (ATTACK A PARTICULAR ENEMY, CAST A SPELL, USE AN ITEM, OR TRY TO RUN.) THEN THE CHARACTERS AND THE ENEMIES ACT IN A RANDOM ORDER. ATTACKED ENEMIES AND PARTY MEMBERS LOSE HIT POINTS, DYING WHEN THEY REACH ZERO HP. WHEN ALL THE ENEMIES ARE DEFEATED, LIVING PARTY MEMBERS RECEIVE EXPERIENCE, EVENTUALLY GAINING A LEVEL AND IMPROVING THEIR STATS WHEN ENOUGH EXPERIENCE IS ACCUMULATED. SLAIN PARTY MEMBERS CAN BE REVIVED IN TOWNS FOR A PRICE. 

SPELLS ARE BOUGHT IN CITIES IN SPECIAL SHOPS. THE SPELLS ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO CATEGORIES - WHITE MAGIC AND BLACK MAGIC. WHITE MAGES CAN ONLY USE WHITE MAGIC, BLACK MAGES CAN ONLY USE BLACK MAGIC, AND RED MAGES CAN USE BOTH. CASTING SPELLS IN BATTLE USES UP MAGIC POINTS, WHICH, LIKE HIT POINTS, CAN BE RESTORED BY RESTING IN INNS.</desc>

		<name>Front Mission</name>
		<desc>IN THE FUTURE, MANY MILITARY FORCES ARE DEPENDENT ON HUGE MECH ROBOTS, CALLED WANZERS (WALKING PANZERS) FOR COMBAT. AT HUFFMAN ISLAND, LOCATED IN THE THE PACIFIC OCEAN, WANZERS ARE DEPLOYED BY BOTH THE USN (UNITED STATES OF THE NEW CONTINENT) AND THE OCU (OCEANA COMMUNITY UNION), WHO DISPUTE OWNERSHIP OVER THE ISLAND.  ONE NIGHT, THE OCU FORCES STAGE A COVERT RECON MISSION ON A FACILITY LOCATED IN LARCUS, A USN-HELD TERRITORY AND WEAPONS FACILITY. LEAD BY A SOLDIER NAMED ROID, THIS MISSION WAS ENTIRELY UNOFFICIAL AND VIOLATED THE PEACE TREATY. DURING THE MISSION, USN FORCES LEAD BY COMMANDER DRISCOLL APPEARED AND AMBUSHED THE OCU SOLDIERS. DURING THE COMBAT, ROID'S FIANCE, KAREN IS KILLED AND THE USN FACILITY IS BLOWN UP; PLACING THE BLAME ON THE OCU. THIS BECAME KNOWN AS THE "LARCUS INCIDENT" AND THE OCU DENIED ALL KNOWLEDGE OF IT'S SOLDIERS ACTIONS. ULTIMATELY IT WOULD BE A LEADING CAUSE TO THE SECOND HUFFMAN WAR. 

ONE YEAR LATER, THE WAR IS UNDERWAY AND HUFFMAN ISLAND IS UNDER PROVISIONAL CONTROL OF THE OCU, BUT WITH A WEAKENED MILITARY UNABLE TO DEFEND AGAINST USN ATTACKS. THE SOLDIERS INVOLVED INVOLVED IN THE LARCUS INCIDENT HAVE ALL BEEN DISCHARGED AND DISGRACED. ROID SPENDS HIS TIME FIGHTING AS A GLADIATOR IN THE WANZER FIGHTING ARENA BEFORE BEING APPROACHED BY A MYSTERIOUS MAN. COLONEL OLSON HAS FOUND OUT ABOUT ROID'S HISTORY AND WANTS HIM TO COMMAND A MERCENARY UNIT HE IS ASSEMBLING ON BEHALF OF THE OCU, DUBBED "CARRION CROW". CONVINCING ROID THAT DRISCOLL IS STILL OUT THERE ON THE ISLAND, ROID AGREES.

FRONT MISSION IS A TURN-BASED STRATEGY RPG PLAYED FROM AN ISOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE. PLAYERS PROGRESS IN THE STORY THROUGH LARGE STRATEGIC BATTLES INVOLVING MULTIPLE UNITS AND CUTSCENES BETWEEN THEM. AT CERTAIN PLACES, USUALLY TOWNS, THE PLAYER CAN VISIT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS INCLUDING BARS AND SHOPS, AND TALK TO PEOPLE. SHOPS ARE ALSO FOUND TO PURCHASE NEW WEAPONRY, PARTS AND MAKE REPAIRS. IN COMBAT, EACH WANZER ROBOT IS A SEPERATE UNIT AND, HAS A LARGE VARIETY OF WEAPONS AND ATTACK STYLES DEPENDING ON WHAT'S EQUIPPED. UNITS GET EXPERIENCE FOR DEFEATING ENEMIES AND ALSO FOR USING VARIOUS TECHNIQUES. THE MORE AN ATTACK IS USED, THE MORE POWERFUL IT BECOMES.</desc>

		<name>Guilty Gear Petit 2</name>
		<desc>IN 22TH CENTURY, SCIENTISTS FOUND A WAY TO CREATE ARTIFICIAL BEINGS WHOM THEY CALLED "GEARS". THESE GEARS WERE VERY POWERFUL, BUT DID NOT HAVE WILLS OF THEIR OWN, AND WERE COMPLETELY OBEDIENT TO THE HUMANS. HOWEVER, A GEAR NAMED JUSTICE WAS ABLE TO FREE HIMSELF FROM THE CONTROL AND LED A REBELLION AGAINST THE HUMANS. SINCE THEN, THE HUMANITY LIVED IN FEAR THAT THE GEARS WILL ONE DAY GAIN THE POWER ON THE EARTH. FOR THAT PURPOSE, THE SACRED ORDER OF THE HOLY KNIGHTS ORGANIZED FIGHTING TOURNAMENTS TO FIND OUT WHO IS STRONG ENOUGH TO FACE THE RENEGADE GEARS.

"GUILTY GEAR PETIT 2" IS VERY SIMILAR TO ITS  PREDECESSOR, HAVING THE SAME "SUPER-DEFORMED" GRAPHICAL STYLE, BATTLE MOVES (INCLUDING THE TENSION SYSTEM TO ACCUMULATE POWER AND COMBO ATTACKS), AS WELL AS BACKGROUNDS FOR BATTLES. SEVERAL NEW CHARACTERS APPEAR IN "GUILTY GEAR PETIT 2", SUCH AS ZATO-1, THE FORMER HEAD OF THE ASSASSIN GUILD, THE PIRATE CAPTAIN JOHNNY, THE TIME TRAVELER AXL LOU FROM THE 20TH CENTURY, THE MYSTERIOUS FAUST, AND OTHERS.</desc>

		<desc>THE GAME TAKES PLACE IN 22TH CENTURY. SCIENTISTS DEVELOPED A NEW TECHNIQUE THAT ALLOWED THEM TO MERGE THE DNA OF HUMANS AND ANIMALS, PRODUCING POWERFUL CREATURES KNOWN AS "GEARS". THE CHARACTERS OF THE GAME PARTICIPATE IN A TOURNAMENT, THE WINNER OF WHICH WOULD FACE A GEAR WHO WENT OUT OF CONTROL AND IS THREATENING TO LEAD A GEAR REBELLION AGAINST THE HUMANS. THE GAME ALLOWS YOU TO PLAY AS FAMILIAR CHARACTERS FROM GUILTY GEAR SERIES, SUCH AS THE MAIN HERO SOL BADGUY, WHO HAS A CERTAIN CONNECTION TO THE GEARS, AND HIS RIVAL, THE LEADER OF THE HOLY KNIGHTS NAMED KY KISKE. IT ALSO INTRODUCES A NEW CHARACTER, THE NURSE FANNY, WHO FIGHTS WITH A SYRINGE AND HAS A MYSTERIOUS CONNECTION TO THE GENIUS SURGEON, AND LATER SERIAL MURDERER, DR. BALDHEAD. 

"GUILTY GEAR PETIT" IS A 2D FIGHTING GAME. THE STORY MODE LETS YOU PICK A CHARACTER AND TAKE HIM/HER THROUGH A SERIES OF FIGHTS, WHILE IN TIME ATTACK MODE YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR OPPONENTS FREELY. THE GRAPHICS ARE DONE IN "SUPER-DEFORMED" STYLE. THE GAME RETAINS KEY INGREDIENTS OF GUILTY GEAR GAMEPLAY, SUCH AS BUILDING TENSION IN ORDER TO EXECUTE POWERFUL ATTACKS, COMBO MOVES, ETC.</desc>

YOU TAKE THE ROLE OF THE COMMANDER OF THE HANJUKU ARMY, AND YOUR GOAL IS TO GUIDE IT SUCCESSFULLY THROUGH A SERIES OF EVENTS (CALLED "TALES"), CAPTURING ENEMY CASTLES AND DEFEATING THE BOSSES OF THE KANJUKU ARMY. 

THIS IS A REAL-TIME WAR STRATEGY GAME. THE GAME TIME IS DIVIDED INTO MONTHS, EACH MONTH TAKING A FEW MINUTES OF REAL TIME. YOU CONTROL THE HERO AND HIS GENERALS, EACH ONE COMMANDING UNITS OF FOOT SOLDIERS. YOU SEND YOUR ARMY COMMANDERS THROUGH THE WORLD MAP TO CAPTURE ENEMY CASTLES. ONCE ALL THE CASTLES ARE CAPTURED, A NEW CONSTRUCTION APPEARS ON THE MAP, WHERE THE LEVEL BOSS RESIDES, AND YOUR FINAL GOAL IN THE CHAPTER (TALE) IS TO DEFEAT THIS BOSS. ONCE YOU RUN INTO AN ENEMY, AN AUTOMATIC BATTLE SEQUENCE OCCURS, WHICH YOU CAN INTERRUPT, ASSIGNING COMMANDS TO YOUR ARMY. BOTH HANJUKU AND KANJUKU ARMIES CAN SUMMON POWERFUL CREATURES CALLED EGG MONSTERS, WHO CAN FIGHT AGAINST A WHOLE ARMY OR AGAINST EACH OTHER IN TURN-BASED COMBAT. EACH MONTH A "MONTHLY EVENT" OCCURS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE LAND, EARTHQUAKE, ETC. RANDOM EVENTS ALSO POP OUT, DURING WHICH YOU CAN BUY SUPPLIES FOR YOUR ARMY.</desc>

		<name>Namco Super Wars</name>
		<desc>NAMCO SUPER WARS IS A TACTICAL ROLE-PLAYING GAME DEVELOPED BY NAMCO AND PUBLISHED BY BANDAI FOR THE WONDERSWAN COLOR. IT IS A CROSSOVER GAME, FEATURING CHARACTERS FROM SEVERAL CLASSIC NAMCO TITLES.

THE GAME IS PLAYED ON A SQUARE GRID, ON WHICH BOTH THE PLAYER'S AND COMPUTER'S UNITS ARE PLACED. EACH SIDE TAKES TURNS MOVING AND MAKING ACTIONS WITH THEIR UNITS. EVERY CHARACTER HAS A VARIETY OF ATTACKS AND SPECIAL MOVES THAT CAN BE SELECTED WHEN PERFORMING AN ACTION. SOME OF THESE CONSUME SPIRIT POINTS, WHICH SLOWLY REGENERATE EACH TURN. THE GAME IS DIVIDED INTO STAGES. BETWEEN EACH STAGE, THE PLAYER IS ABLE TO VISIT A SHOP AND PREPARE HIS UNITS BEFORE STARTING THE NEXT STAGE. UNLIKE MOST RPGS, CHARACTERS DO NOT GAIN LEVELS FOR DIRECTLY DEFEATING OPPONENTS. INSTEAD, COMPLETION OF A MAP WILL REWARD THE PLAYERS WITH A NUMBER OF LEVEL UPS, WHICH THEY CAN THEN DISTRIBUTE AMONG THEIR UNITS AS THEY WISH.</desc>

		<desc>YOU PLAY AS THE RHYME RIDER KERORCIAN, A VIVACIOUS SPACE GIRL WITH A LARGE FROG HELMET, AS SHE SKIPS TO THE MUSIC THROUGH THE GAMES FOUR STAGES. THE GAMES MUSIC IS LARGELY COMPRISED OF JAZZY TECHNO PIECES.

KERORCIAN SKIPS DOWN A SET LINE WHILE RANDOMLY PLACED ENEMIES AND OBSTACLES APPEAR BEFORE HER. VARIOUS BUTTON COMBOS WILL AVOID CERTAIN OBSTACLES, ALTHOUGH A "ONE-BUTTON" EASY MODE IS AVAILABLE. WHEN YOU AVOID AN OBSTACLE A NOTE WILL SOUND, CLEARING LONG CHAINS OF OBSTACLES WILL RESULT IN FUNKY MELODIES POPPING UP INSIDE THE SONG THAT IS PLAYING. THIS GAMEPLAY IS REMINISCENT OF THE STUDIOS EARLIER GAME VIB RIBBON.  

SOME OF THE OBSTACLES ARE INTERACTIVE, SUCH AS A ROCKET ONE CAN JUMP ON AND RIDE A SHORT DISTANCE, OTHERS CAN MERELY BE KICKED OUT OF THE WAY OR JUMPED OVER.

OCCASIONALLY A CROWN WILL APPEAR OVER AN OBSTACLE, IF YOU SUCCESSFULLY CLEAR IT YOU WILL BRIEFLY SOAR OVER THE STAGE AVOIDING ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN YOUR PATH. THIS IS ESPECIALLY COMMON BEFORE OBSTACLES THAT MIGHT REQUIRE OUTLANDISH BUTTON COMBOS.</desc>

		<desc>RIVIERA: THE PROMISED LAND IS A TURN BASED ROLE PLAYING GAME. IT FOLLOWS A TRADITIONAL RPG FORMULA - ONCE PEACEFUL LAND NOW RAVAGED BY DEMONS AND THEIR WARS WITH ANGELS. HOWEVER, IT ALSO INCORPORATES A "DATING SIM" AS A SUBPLOT WHERE YOUR CHARACTER MUST WIN AFFECTION OF ANOTHER CHARACTER.

IT HAS SIMILARITIES TO FIRE EMBLEM, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS, GOLDEN SUN AND A NUMBER OF OTHERS. REACHING HIGH LEVELS IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE THE GAME NOT TOO DIFFICULT AT THE END. THE LEVELLING UP IS SIMILAR TO SECRET OF MANA, WHERE THE WEAPON SKILL FOR A CHARACTER INCREASES AT A DIFFERENT RATE TO THE CHARACTER LEVELS.</desc>
