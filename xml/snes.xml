		<name>90 Minutes : European Prime Goal</name>
		<desc>90 MINUTES: EUROPEAN PRIME GOAL IS A SOCCER GAME WITH THE 14 TEAMS OF THE JAPANESE FIRST DIVISION (J. LEAGUE) TO PLAY WITH. IN THE EUROPEAN VERSION THEY WERE REPLACED BY NATIONAL TEAMS, BUT THE SOME PLAYING MODES ARE STILL REMINISCENT OF THE ORIGIN. THE AVAILABLE MODES ARE EXHIBITION MATCHES, TOURNAMENT, LEAGUE, CUP AND ALL-STAR (THE TEAMS ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO LEAGUES AND THE OVERALL WINNER IS DECIDED WITH PLAY-OFFS). WITH THE OPTION "YOU'RE A HERO", THE PLAYER CAN CREATE A NEW ATHLETE, CHANGE HIS STATS WITH A FEW TRAINING LESSONS AND SWAP IT WITH AN EXISTING ONE. THE PLAYER EITHER CONTROLS THE ATHLETE WHO HAS THE BALL OR, WHEN IN DEFENSE, THE ONE WHO IS NEAREST TO IT. THE FIELD IS SHOWN FROM A SLIGHTLY ANGLED SIDE-PERSPECTIVE. DURING MOST MODES, ALL TEAMS CAN BE TAKEN OVER BY HUMAN PLAYERS, BUT ONLY TWO CAN PLAY AT THE SAME TIME.</desc>

		<desc>A GAME ENDORSED BY THE AMERICAN PLAYER WHO STUNNED THE TENNIS WORLD IN THE EARLY 90S WITH HIS "IMAGE IS EVERYTHING" LOOKS, SPORTING LONG HAIR, EARRINGS AND COLORFUL SHIRTS, ANDRE AGASSI TENNIS INCLUDES EIGHT PLAYERS (MALE AND FEMALE AND AS AS EXPECTED, ONLY AGASSI IS A REAL PLAYER) RATED ACCORDING TO MOVEMENT SPEED AND BOTH ACCURACY AND STRENGTH ON SERVE, BACKHAND AND FOREHAND.

GAMEPLAY FEATURES ALL THE USUAL MOVES: SMASHES, PASSING SHOTS, VOLLEYS AND ALL KINDS OF BACKHAND AND FOREHAND PLAYS, BUT UNLIKE OTHER GAMES, PRECISE POSITIONING AND TIMING ARE CRUCIAL TO AVOID HITTING THE BALL OUTSIDE THE COURT, SWINGING THE RACKET INTO THIN AIR OR MORE EMBARRASSING, LET THE BALL HIT YOU ON THE HEAD.
THREE COURTS ARE AVAILABLE: GRASS, CLAY AND INDOOR (SEGA VERSIONS  ADD A FOURTH, HARD), BUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM ARE MINIMAL. GAME MODES CHANGE ACCORDING TO THE VERSION, WITH THE 16-BIT VERSIONS INCLUDING A "SKINS" GAME, WHERE EACH POINT IS WORTH A SUM OF MONEY BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE BALL WAS HIT.</desc>

THE PLAYER IS A SPACEMAN WITH A JET-PACK, FLYING ACROSS A BARREN LANDSCAPE WHOSE SKIES ARE INHABITED BY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ALIENS; FROM THE SIMPLE PLANTER TO THE SLOWLY ADVANCING BLUNDER STORM OR THE QUICK, AGGRESSIVE NEMESITE. 

PLANTERS AND NEMESITES WILL TRY TO PICKUP THE SMALL MEN WALKING ON THE SURFACE, WHO MUST THEN BE RESCUED. YOU MUST SHOOT DOWN THE ALIEN, WHILE AVOIDING TO HIT THE MAN. SOMETIMES, THE ALIENS WILL CARRY AN ANDROID, WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE HUMAN BUT DEADLY. CARE MUST BE TAKEN SO AS TO NOT PICK UP THE ANDROIDS. ALL MEN MUST BE TRANSPORTED TO A SURFACE BASE, WHERE THEY ARE PUT IN SAFETY. THIS IS THE DROPZONE.</desc>

IN EACH LEVEL, BARBIE STARTS BY GOING LEFT TO RIGHT WITH FORCED SCROLLING.  SHE HAS A DEFAULT SPEED AND CAN SPEED UP AS WELL.  SHE MUST AVOID MOVING OBSTACLES BY MOVING UP AND DOWN AND CONTROLLING HER SPEED.  IF SHE HITS ONE, SHE LOSES A CHANCE AND IT'S GAME OVER IF SHE RUNS OUT OF CHANCES.  SHE MUST PICK UP ITEMS WHICH GRANT POINT BONUSES AND EXTRA CHANCES.

THERE IS ALSO A CAMERA ITEM TO PICK UP WHICH BRINGS YOU TO A MAGAZINE COVER SHOOT.  YOU ARE SHOWN A COVER WITH BARBIE WEARING AN OUTFIT WHICH IS THEMED TO THE LEVEL.  YOU MUST THEN GO TO HER DRESSING ROOM AND DRESS HER IN A MATCHING OUTFIT.  YOU ARE ALSO GIVEN SEPARATE CONTROL OF THE COLORS OF THREE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS AND MUST MATCH THESE.  YOU ARE AWARDED POINTS FOR EACH CORRECT MATCH.

WHEN YOU REACH THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LEVEL, YOU ARE GIVEN A RUNWAY PRACTICE.  THIS CONSISTS OF FOUR POSITIONS ON THE RUNWAY FLOOR LABELED TO TELL YOU WHICH BUTTON YOU MUST PRESS AT EACH ONE.

BARBIE THEN GOES BACK THROUGH THE LEVEL RIGHT-TO-LEFT.  ON THE RETURN TRIP, THERE IS A HANDBAG TO PICK UP.  THIS BRINGS YOU TO ANOTHER MAGAZINE COVER.  YOU THEN GO TO A MAKEUP MIRROR WHERE YOU MUST MATCH BARBIE'S HAIRSTYLE, EARRINGS, EYESHADOW AND LIP AND NAIL COLOR TO THE COVER.  AGAIN, YOU ARE AWARDED POINTS FOR EACH ITEM WHICH YOU GET CORRECT.

WHEN YOU REACH THE LEFT SIDE OF THE LEVEL, YOU MUST THEN DO BARBIE'S RUNWAY WALK THAT YOU WERE GIVEN EARLIER.  YOU ARE AWARDED POINTS FOR EACH STATION AT WHICH YOU PERFORM THE CORRECT MOVE.

BARBIE THEN CONTINUES TO THE NEXT LEVEL.  THERE ARE A TOTAL OF FOUR: BARBIE DRIVING DOWN THE STREET, SKATING ON THE BEACH, WALKING THROUGH A SKI RESORT AND WALKING THROUGH THE PARK.</desc>

		<desc>IN BARBIE VACATION ADVENTURE, BARBIE, ALONG WITH HER FRIEND MIDGE IN TWO-PLAYER MODE, TRAVELS AROUND THE COUNTRY TO FOUR DIFFERENT VACATION SPOTS, EACH WITH ITS OWN SET OF MINI GAMES.

IN IOWA, AT A COUNTY FAIR, BARBIE MUST CATCH AN ESCAPED PIG BY WALKING UP TO IT AND PRESSING THE ACTION BUTTON, AFTER THAT SHE CAN PLAY CARNIVAL GAMES.  THE OPTIONS ARE A STRENGTH TEST, KNOCKING DOWN CANS AND A HIT-THE CLOWN GAME.  IN THE LATTER TWO, PLAYERS CAN  AIM BALLS WITH THE D-PAD, THEN THROW WITH THE ACTION BUTTON.  LEADING TARGETS IS REQUIRED.  THE STRENGTH TEST HAS A MATER THAT GOES UP AND DOWN AND BARBIE MUST LAND HER HIT WHEN THE INDICATOR IS ON THE BELL TO RING IT.

IN WYOMING, BARBIE GOES CAMPING.  FIRST, SHE MUST ASSEMBLE HER TENT.  THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A JIGSAW PUZZLE.  NEXT, SHE MUST JUMP FROM ROCK TO ROCK TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARK WHERE SHE CAN GO ON A NATURE HIKE.  IN THE NEXT SEGMENT, PLAYERS AIM A CAMERA CURSOR AT ANIMALS AS BARBIE WALKS ALONG THE PATH AND HIT THE ACTION BUTTON TO TAKE PHOTOS.  THIS REQUIRES GOOD REACTION TIME.

THERE'S A RANCH IN TEXAS WHERE BARBIE CAN RIDE HORSES.  THE HORSE RUNS ON ITS OWN.  THE PLAYER PUSHES THE ACTION BUTTON TO MAKE IT JUMP.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS GATES ON THE COURSE AND THE PLAYER MUST TIME JUMPS CORRECTLY TO CLEAR THEM.  IF THEY HIT TOO MANY, THEY MUST START OVER.  THERE IS ALSO THE OPTION TO PLAY HORSESHOES.  THE CURSOR MOVES ABOUT ERRATICALLY AND YOU MUST PRESS THE ACTION BUTTON WHEN IT PASSES OVER THE STAKE.

IN FLORIDA, BARBIE CAN PLAY VOLLEYBALL AGAINST MIDGE.  THIS GAME ALLOWS BOTH PLAYERS TO PLAY SIMULTANEOUSLY IN TWO-PLAYER MODE.  BARBIE AND MIDGE CAN MOVE FORWARD OR BACKWARD ON THE COURT AND HIT ACTION TO SET THE BALL.  FIRST ONE TO TEN POINTS WINS.  THERE IS ALSO A DIVING SEGMENT WHERE BARBIES MUST NAVIGATE AN UNDERWATER MAZE TO COLLECT SUNKEN TREASURE. IT MIGHT REMIND SOME PEOPLE OF BARBIE'S OCEAN DISCOVERY.

		<desc>THIS GAME CONSISTS OF FIVE 3-DAY TOURNAMENTS AT FOUR LAKES. THE MISSION IS TO CATCH AS MUCH LARGE BASS AS POSSIBLE. ONCE THE DAY OF THE FISHING TOURNAMENT IS OVER, THE FIVE LARGEST BASS THAT WERE CAUGHT GET WEIGHED AND ARE COMPARED TO THE OTHER FISHERMAN'S CATCHES. THE ONE WITH THE HEAVIEST CATCH IS THE WINNER.

THE PLAYER STARTS OFF CHOOSING AN ANGLER. THEN THE PLAYER CAN EITHER GO TO THE BAIT SHOP, PRACTICE POND, OR START IN THE TOURNAMENT. IN THE BAIT SHOP, CHOICES OF BAITS, LINES, RODS, REELS, FISH FINDERS, AND BOAT ENGINES ARE AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE. THE PRACTICE POND MODE IS JUST WHERE THE PLAYER CAN CUT HIS TEETH ON THE GAME MECHANICS WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE.

THE TOURNAMENT MODE IS THE MAIN PART OF THE GAME. PLAYERS START OUT IN A FISHING BOAT. SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT YOUR FISHING ARE TEMPERATURE, WIND SPEED, WATER CLARITY AND TIME OF DAY. AFTER CASTING THE LINE, THE GAME GOES FROM AN ABOVE THE LAKE VIEW TO A SIDE VIEW OF THE LAKE WATER DEPTHS. THEN IT'S JUST UP TO THE PLAYER TO ATTRACT THE FISH WITH THE BAIT, AND AFTER THE FISH IS CAUGHT ON THE HOOK, REEL IT IN.</desc>

		<desc>THE SUCCESSFUL MOVIE SEQUEL BATMAN RETURNS SPAWNED MANY DIFFERENT GAME ADAPTATIONS. THE SNES VERSION PRESENTS THE STORY OF BATMAN'S ENCOUNTER WITH THE PENGUIN AND CATWOMAN AS A SIDE-SCROLLING BEAT'EM'UP, WITH ONE BATMOBILE DRIVING SEQUENCE THROWN IN.

THERE ARE TWO VARIETIES OF THE BEAT'EM'UP LEVELS. ONE PLAYS LIKE FINAL FIGHT AND SIMILAR GAMES: BATMAN CAN MOVE IN TWO DIMENSIONS, BEATING UP HIS ENEMIES WITH VARIOUS PUNCHES, KICKS, COMBOS AND SPECIAL MOVES.
SPECIAL GADGETS TO BE USED INCLUDE THE FAMOUS BATARANG TO TAKE OUT ENEMIES FROM A DISTANCE AND "TEST TUBES" FILLED WITH CHEMICAL EXPLOSIVES WHICH WILL DAMAGE ALL ENEMIES ON THE SCREEN.

IN THE SECOND TYPE OF SIDE-SCROLLING LEVEL, BATMAN CAN ONLY MOVE IN ONE DIMENSION, LEFT OR RIGHT. THE BATARANG IS THE STANDARD WEAPON HERE, WITH PUNCHES ONLY BEING USED WHEN THE ENEMY GETS CLOSE. ALSO IN THESE LEVELS, BATMAN CAN USE A GRAPPLING HOOK TO CROSS DANGEROUS AREAS UNHARMED.

ENEMIES IN THE BEAT'EM'UP LEVELS USUALLY BELONG TO THE PENGUIN'S RED TRIANGLE CIRCUS GANG - CLOWNS IN ALL VARIETIES: THIN CLOWNS, FAT CLOWNS, CLOWNS ON BIKES, CLOWNS ARMED WITH BAZOOKAS, AND MORE. AT THE END OF EACH LEVEL THERE IS A BOSS FIGHT, INCLUDING SEVERAL ENCOUNTERS WITH CATWOMAN AND THE PENGUIN.

IN THE BATMOBILE DRIVING LEVEL, THE ACTION IS VIEWED FROM BEHIND. BATMAN HAS TO EVADE CLOWNS ON BIKES AND SHOOT THEM DOWN WHEN HE GETS THE CHANCE. AT THE END OF THE ROAD, ANOTHER BOSS FIGHT AWAITS.

DIGITIZED IMAGES FROM THE FILM ILLUSTRATE THE STORYLINE.</desc>

ENEMIES SUCH AS ANIMATRONIC ROBOTS AND SECURITY GUARDS MUST BE TAKEN OUT IN THE FIRST TIME-LIMITED LEVEL.  SOME ITEMS CAN ALSO BE PICKED UP AND THROWN AT ENEMIES.   THE SECOND LEVEL HAS THE BABY PEEWEE IN A CHINA SHOP KNOCKING GLASSES OFF SHELVES AND YOU MUST BREAK 10 BEFORE THEY HIT YOU OR THE GROUND OR ARE GRABBED BY YOUR CARETAKER ROBIN.  THERE IS ALSO A HAUNTED HOUSE MAZE LEVEL WHERE YOU MUST KEEP TRYING DIFFERENT DOORS UNTIL YOU FIND THE EXIT
WHILE AVOIDING MUMMIES ALONG THE WAY. THEN THERE'S A PIRATE SHIP BEAT EM' UP LEVEL AND EVENTUALLY YOU MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE UNDERGROUND CONTROL CENTER AND THE BIG BOSS.</desc>

		<desc>ON DAY AN ALIEN RACE OF SLUGS IS OUT PATROLLING SPACE, WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER THE LUCASARTS LOGO. THE LOGO, AS WE ALL KNOW LOOKS LIKE A STATUE OF A PERSON WITH HIS HANDS EXTENDING TOWARDS THE SKY. SEEING THIS LOGO, THE SLUGS DETERMINE THAT OURS IS A RACE MADE UP OF BONES AND OF ADVERTISING, TWO THINGS THE SLUGS SIMPLY HATE. SO THEY ATTACK.

WITH THE SLUG INVASION IN FULL SWING, EARTH IS QUITE SIMPLY OUTNUMBERED BY THE GOOEY SLUGS. IT MUST RECRUIT SPECIAL SUPER SOLDIERS, BIG SKY TROOPERS, ARMED WITH A SPECIAL HEAVILY ARMORED SUIT TO COMBAT THE MENACE. SO URGENT IS THE NEED FOR QUALIFIED BIG SKY TROOPERS, THAT RECRUITING AND RANK ARE PETTY THINGS. IT IS NOT UNKNOWN FOR EXAMPLE FOR A BRAND NEW TROOPER TO START AS A 21-STAR GENERAL IN THE ARMY.

ONCE SELECTED, IT IS UP TO YOUR BIG SKY TROOPER, PILOTING A FIDO CLASS STARSHIP, TO ENGAGE THE SLUGS IN SPACE AND IN PLANETFALL AND THWART THEIR PLANS TO DESTROY MYTHICAL GALACTIC DEVICES AND CONQUER HUMANITY.</desc>

BRUTAL: PAWS OF FURY IS A STANDARD ONE-ON-ONE BEAT 'EM UP ACROSS A VARIETY OF LEVELS, WITH MOSTLY OUTDOOR TERRAIN. YOU CAN CHOOSE OF THE MANY CHARACTERS. THROUGHOUT THE GAME, YOUR CHARACTER TRAVELS ACROSS DALAI LLAMA'S ISLAND, FIGHTING A SERIES OF DUELS BEFORE GETTING TO THE FINAL SHOWDOWN. 

DURING A DUEL, YOU CAN PUNCH AND KICK YOUR OPPONENT, TRY TO USE SPECIAL ATTACKS ON HIM/HER, OR USE A "TAUNT" THAT RESTORES A BIT OF YOUR HEALTH. EACH BATTLE LASTS A NUMBER OF ROUNDS (HOW MANY - THAT IS DETERMINED IN THE OPTIONS MENU); ONCE ONE COMBATANT HAS WON THAT NUMBER OF TIMES DURING THE BATTLE, HE WINS. IF THE COMPUTER-CONTROLLED PLAYER WON, IT'S GAME OVER (BUT YOU CAN STILL USE A CONTINUE TO START THE FIGHT ANEW); IF YOU WON, YOU MOVE ON TO THE NEXT OPPONENT. ONCE YOU HAVE DEFEATED THEM, YOU CAN WATCH AN ENDING ANIMATION, DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE CHARACTER YOU HAVE CHOSEN. 

INSTEAD OF BEGINNING A WHOLE NEW GAME, YOU CAN FIGHT A SINGLE DUEL, CHOOSING THE OPPONENT AND TERRAIN. YOU CAN CHOOSE TO FIGHT EITHER A COMPUTER-CONTROLLED OPPONENT OR ANOTHER HUMAN PLAYER. 

THE VISUALS ARE LEANT TOWARDS CUTESINESS, WHICH MAKES A CHANGE FROM THE GORE OF MORTAL KOMBAT AND THE METAL OF RISE OF THE ROBOTS.

IN THE CONSOLE VERSIONS, YOU START THE GAME WITHOUT SPECIAL MOVES, BUT GET A NEW ONE AFTER EACH SUCCESSFUL BEST-OF-THREE BOUT. THE COMPUTER VERSIONS DROP THIS FEATURE, THOUGH.</desc>

		<desc>BUST-A-MOVE (ALSO KNOWN AS PUZZLE BOBBLE) IS A REAL-TIME PUZZLE GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYER CONTROLS A DEVICE CALLED "POINTER" AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, AIMING AND RELEASING RANDOMLY COLORED BUBBLES UPWARDS. DEPENDING ON THE AIMING, THE BUBBLES MAY FLOAT UP DIRECTLY OR BOUNCE OFF THE WALLS, CHANGING THEIR TRAJECTORY. THE GOAL IS TO AIM THE BUBBLES IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY WILL TOUCH IDENTICALLY COLORED ONES. WHEN SUCH BUBBLES FORM A GROUP OF THREE OR MORE, THEY POP AND DISAPPEAR FROM THE SCREEN.

IF THE CEILING OF THE AREA IS COVERED BY TOO MANY BUBBLES, IT WILL GRADUALLY DESCEND; THE GAME IS OVER WHEN IT NEARLY REACHES THE PLAYER-CONTROLLED POINTER. SHOULD THE PLAYER FAIL TO RELEASE THE BUBBLES WITHIN A SPECIFIC TIME LIMIT, THEY WILL BE RELEASED AUTOMATICALLY, UNAFFECTED BY THE POINTER'S AIMING.

A TWO-PLAYER MODE IS INCLUDED AS WELL. EACH PLAYER COMPETES ON AN AREA OCCUPYING HALF OF THE SCREEN, DEALING WITH IDENTICALLY GENERATED BUBBLES. WHENEVER A PLAYER SUCCESSFULLY DISPOSES OF A BUBBLE GROUP, A PART OF IT IS TRANSFERRED ONTO THE OPPONENT'S PART OF THE SCREEN.

THE GAME FEATURES THE TWO DINOSAUR PROTAGONISTS (BOB AND BUB) AS WELL AS OTHER CHARACTERS FROM BUBBLE BOBBLE, EVEN THOUGH THE TWO GAMES HAVE DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT GAMEPLAY.</desc>

TRUE TO HIS HABIT OF STEALING AND DESTROYING THINGS, MEAN EUGENE TOOK THE MAP FROM CHESTER, TORE IT TO PIECES, AND SCATTERED THEM ALL ACROSS UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. CHESTER MUST NOW VISIT VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN THE COUNTRY TO RETRIEVE THE MAP PIECES AND TO FIND A WAY TO HIP CITY.

THE PLAYER MAY EXPLORE THE GAME WORLD IN A NON-LINEAR FASHION. AT ANY TIME, THERE ARE THREE LEVELS AVAILABLE AND THE PLAYER MAY TACKLE THEM IN ANY ORDER. EACH SOLVED LEVEL LEADS TO ADDITIONAL TWO. ON EACH LEVEL, THE PLAYER MUST FIND THE MISSING MAP PIECE, PROCEED TO THE EXIT, AND DEFEAT THE LEVEL BOSS. CHESTER CAN DASH AND KILL ENEMIES BY JUMPING ON THEIR HEADS. HE DIES FROM ONE HIT, UNLESS HE HAS A PACK OF THE CHEETAHS SNACK AT HIS DISPOSAL. IN THIS CASE, HE'LL RECOVER FULL HEALTH.</desc>

		<desc>THE EVIL ALLIANCE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF BELSER IS ATTACKING YOUR WORLD; AS PILOT OF A SILVER HAWK FIGHTER, YOUR GOAL IS TO STOP THEM! DARIUS TWIN IS A SIDE SCROLLING SHOOTER SIMILAR TO OTHER GAMES IN THE DARIUS SERIES. YOU'LL FLY THROUGH A SERIES OF DIFFERENT STAGES, EACH WITH NUMEROUS ENEMIES AND ENDING WITH A LARGE BOSS. YOU BEGIN THE GAME WITH A LIMITED AMOUNT OF FIRE POWER, BUT AFTER SHOOTING CERTAIN ENEMIES POWER UPS ARE LEFT BEHIND TO INCREASE YOUR CAPABILITIES. UNLIKE MANY OF THE DARIUS GAMES, IF YOUR SHIP IS DESTROYED YOU DON'T LOSE ALL OF THE WEAPONS YOU'VE COLLECTED; LIKEWISE YOU ALSO CONTINUE ON AT THE SAME POINT RATHER THAN BEING SENT BACK TO A CHECKPOINT. SIMILAR TO MANY OF THE DARIUS GAMES THERE ARE DIFFERENT ROUTES THAT CAN BE TAKEN TOWARDS THE FINAL STAGE. AT THE END OF EACH STAGE, YOU ARE SHOWN A MAP AND CAN SELECT THE NEXT STAGE YOU WOULD LIKE TO COMPLETE.</desc>

		<desc>A TENNIS GAME FEATURING BOTH AN EXHIBITION AND A TOURNAMENT MODE. IN THE HEAD TO HEAD EXHIBITION MODE, THE PLAYER CAN CHOOSE THEIR OPPONENT (WITH THE HIGHER RANKED OPPONENTS BEING BETTER THAN THE LOWER RANKED ONES). THE TOURNAMENT MODE ALLOWS FOR 16 DIFFERENT PLAYERS TO COMPETE TO BECOME THE CHAMPION. BOTH OF THESE MODES CAN BE PLAYED ON EITHER GRASS, HARD, OR A CLAY COURT. THE PLAYER CAN ALSO CHOOSE WHETHER TO BE EITHER A LEFT OR RIGHT HANDED TENNIS PLAYER.

DURING THE GAME, WHOEVER IS SERVING THE BALL WILL BE CLOSER TO THE SCREEN. PLAYERS WILL BE ABLE TO USE TOPSPIN, EXECUTE DROP SHOTS, PERFORM VOLLEYS, LOBS, SLICES AND OVERHEAD SMASHES, AND DECIDE ON EITHER A HARD OR SOFT SERVE TO KEEP THE OPPONENT OFF BALANCE.

ALTHOUGH THE GAME FEATURES FICTIONAL PLAYERS, IT IS ENDORSED BY FOOTLOCKER.</desc>

		<name>Demolition Man</name>
		<desc>DEMOLITION MAN IS A GAME BASED ON THE 1993 MOVIE BY THE SAME NAME. AS WITH THE MOVIE, THE GAME TAKES PLACE IN A DYSTOPIAN LOS ANGELES, IN 1996. JOHN SPARTAN IS THE COUNTRY´S MOST FEARSOME COP AND HUNTS HIS NEMESIS, SIMON PHOENIX. HOWEVER IN DOING SO, HE KILLS SEVERAL INNOCENT CIVILIANS AND BOTH CHARACTERS ARE SENTENCED TO CRYOSTASIS REHABILITATION WHERE THEY WILL BE BRAINWASHED FOR 30 YEARS. HOWEVER THE BRAINWASHING DOES NOT GO AS PLANNED AND UPON WAKING UP, PHOENIX GOES ON A NEW CRIME SPREE. HOWEVER IN 30 YEARS THE WORLD HAS ALSO CHANGED AND LOS ANGELES HAS BECOME SAN ANGELES, A UTOPIAN AND VIOLENCE-FREE SOCIETY. AS A REMNANT OF A MORE VIOLENT PAST, POLICE OFFICER JOHN SPARTAN IS ONCE AGAIN SENT TO CAPTURE PHOENIX.

DEMOLITION MAN IS A FAST-PACED PLATFORM GAME, WITH SOME LEVELS TAKING PLACE IN AN OVERHEAD PERSPECTIVE (SIMILAR TO SMASH TV). AS JOHN SPARTAN, THE PLAYER WILL SPEND MOST OF HIS TIME SHOOTING ENDLESS WAVES OF "CRYOCONS" RELEASED UPON THE ANTISEPTIC WORLD OF THE FUTURE. THE STANDARD WEAPON CAN BE UPGRADED WITH A SHOTGUN AND MAGNUM, BOTH WITH LIMITED AMMO. ADDITIONALLY, VARIOUS TYPES OF GRENADES CAN BE COLLECTED, WHICH ARE THROWN INDEPENDENTLY OF THE FIREARM. SIMON PHOENIX APPEARS AS A BOSS CHARACTER AT THE END OF EVERY LEVEL THAT IS DIRECTLY TIED IN WITH THE MOVIE.

THE SEGA CD VERSION OF THE GAME RETAINS IDENTICAL LEVELS AND GAMEPLAY, BUT ADDS DIGITIZED CLIPS FROM THE FILM TO INTRODUCE LEVELS AND ADVANCE THE PLOT.</desc>

		<desc>THE UNION AEROSPACE CORPORATION HAS BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH TELEPORTATION TECHNOLOGY ON MARS' MOONS PHOBOS AND DEIMOS. AFTER EARLY SUCCESSES, SOMETHING GOES WRONG. IT SEEMS THE SCIENTISTS HAVE OPENED A GATEWAY STRAIGHT TO HELL. PHOBOS BASE IS OVERRUN WITH DEMONIC CREATURES, AND THE WHOLE OF DEIMOS SIMPLY VANISHES. A SQUAD OF MARINES IS SENT TO PHOBOS, BUT ALL EXCEPT ONE ARE QUICKLY SLAUGHTERED. IT FALLS TO THE SURVIVING MARINE TO GRAB SOME GUNS AND STRIKE BACK AT THE DEMONS.

ID SOFTWARE'S FOLLOW-UP TO THEIR GENRE-DEFINING WOLFENSTEIN 3D, DOOM IS ANOTHER FIRST PERSON SHOOTER: FULL-ON ACTION SEEN FROM THE SPACE MARINE'S PERSPECTIVE. LIKE WOLFENSTEIN, THE GAME CONSISTS OF DISTINCT EPISODES, PLAYABLE IN ANY ORDER. THE FIRST EPISODE, KNEE-DEEP IN THE DEAD, TAKES PLACE IN THE PHOBOS BASE AND IS FREELY AVAILABLE AS SHAREWARE. THE FULL GAME CONTINUES ON DEIMOS IN THE SHORES OF HELL AND CULMINATES IN INFERNO, THE FINAL EPISODE WHICH TAKES PLACE IN HELL ITSELF. EACH EPISODE CONSISTS OF NINE LEVELS, ONE OF WHICH IS A HIDDEN LEVEL.

THE BASIC OBJECTIVE IN EACH LEVEL IS SIMPLY TO REACH THE EXIT. SINCE DOZENS OF ENEMIES STAND IN THE WAY, THE ONLY WAY TO GET THERE IS THROUGH KILLING THEM. SWITCHES AND BUTTONS MUST BE 
PRESSED TO ADVANCE AT CERTAIN POINTS AND OFTEN COLOR-CODED LOCKED DOORS WILL BLOCK THE WAY - MATCHING KEYCARDS OR SKULL KEYS MUST BE FOUND TO PASS.

DOOM'S ENGINE TECHNOLOGY IS MORE ADVANCED THAN WOLFENSTEIN'S, AND THUS THE LEVELS ARE MORE VARIED AND COMPLEX. THE ENGINE SIMULATES DIFFERENT HEIGHTS (STAIRS AND LIFTS APPEAR FREQUENTLY) AND DIFFERENT LIGHTING CONDITIONS (SOME ROOMS ARE PITCH BLACK, OTHERS ONLY BARELY ILLUMINATED). THERE ARE OUTDOOR AREAS, POOLS OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE THAT HURT THE PLAYER, CEILINGS THAT COME DOWN AND CRUSH HIM, AND UNLIKE WOLFENSTEIN'S ORTHOGONALLY ALIGNED CORRIDORS, THE WALLS IN DOOM CAN BE IN ANY ANGLE TO EACH OTHER. AN AUTOMAP HELPS IN NAVIGATING THE LEVELS.

STYLISTICALLY, THE LEVELS BEGIN WITH A FUTURISTIC THEME IN THE MILITARY BASE ON PHOBOS AND GRADUALLY CHANGE TO A HELLISH ENVIRONMENT, COMPLETE WITH SATANIC SYMBOLS (PENTAGRAMS, UPSIDE-DOWN-CROSSES AND PORTRAITS OF HORNED DEMONS), HUNG-UP MUTILATED CORPSES AND THE DISTORTED FACES OF THE DAMNED.

DOOM FEATURES A LARGE WEAPON ARSENAL, WITH MOST WEAPONS HAVING BOTH ADVANTAGES AND DRAWBACKS. THE STARTING WEAPONS ARE THE FISTS AND A SIMPLE PISTOL. ALSO AVAILABLE ARE A SHOTGUN (HIGH DAMAGE, SLOW RELOAD, NOT GOOD AT DISTANCES), A CHAINGUN (HIGH FIRING RATE, BUT SLIGHTLY INACCURATE IN LONGER BURSTS) AND A PLASMA RIFLE (COMBINING A HIGH FIRING RATE AND LARGE DAMAGE). THE ROCKET LAUNCHER ALSO DEALS OUT LOTS OF DAMAGE, BUT THE EXPLOSION CAUSES BLAST DAMAGE AND MUST BE USED WITH CARE IN CONFINED AREAS OR IT MIGHT PROVE DEADLY TO THE PLAYER AS WELL AS THE ENEMIES. TWO FURTHER (IN)FAMOUS WEAPONS IN DOOM ARE THE CHAINSAW FOR CLOSE-QUARTER CARNAGE, AND THE BFG9000 ENERGY GUN, THAT, WHILE TAKING SOME PRACTICE TO FIRE CORRECTLY, CAN DESTROY MOST ENEMIES IN A SINGLE BURST. THE DIFFERENT WEAPONS USE FOUR DIFFERENT AMMUNITION TYPES (BULLETS, SHELLS, ROCKETS AND ENERGY CELLS), SO COLLECTING THE RIGHT TYPE FOR A CERTAIN GUN IS IMPORTANT.

DOOM DROPS SOME OF WOLFENSTEIN'S ARCADE-INSPIRED ASPECTS, SO THERE ARE NO EXTRA LIVES OR TREASURES TO BE COLLECTED FOR POINTS, BUT MANY OTHER POWERUPS ARE STILL AVAILABLE. MEDPACKS HEAL DAMAGE WHILE ARMOR PROTECTS FROM RECEIVING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. BACKPACKS ALLOW MORE AMMUNITION TO BE CARRIED, A COMPUTER MAP REVEALS THE WHOLE LAYOUT OF THE LEVEL ON THE AUTOMAP (INCLUDING ANY SECRET AREAS), LIGHT AMPLIFICATION VISORS ILLUMINATE DARK AREAS AND RADIATION SUITS ALLOW TRAVEL OVER WASTE WITHOUT TAKING DAMAGE. ALSO AVAILABLE ARE BERSERK PACKS (WHICH RADICALLY INCREASE THE DAMAGE INFLICTED BY THE FISTS) AS WELL AS SHORT-TIME INVISIBILITY AND INVULNERABILITY POWERUPS.

THE ENEMIES TO BE DESTROYED INCLUDE FORMER HUMANS CORRUPTED DURING THE INVASION, PLUS DEMONS IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES: FIREBALL-THROWING IMPS, FLOATING SKULLS, PINK-SKINNED DEMONS WITH POWERFUL BITE ATTACKS AND LARGE ONE-EYED FLYING MONSTROSITIES CALLED CACODEMONS. EACH EPISODE ENDS WITH A BOSS BATTLE AGAINST ONE OR TWO ESPECIALLY POWERFUL CREATURES.

DOOM POPULARIZED MULTIPLAYER IN THE GENRE WITH TWO DIFFERENT MODES: COOPERATIVE ALLOWS UP TO FOUR PLAYERS TO MOVE THROUGH THE SINGLE-PLAYER GAME TOGETHER, WHILE DEATHMATCH IS A COMPETITIVE GAME TYPE WHERE PLAYERS BLAST AT EACH OTHER TO COLLECT 'FRAG' POINTS FOR A KILL AND RE-SPAWN IN 
A RANDOM LOCATION AFTER BEING KILLED.</desc>

THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOLLOW THE STANDARD SET: FOULS AND OFFSIDES CAN BE TOGGLED ON AND OFF, THE MATCH LENGTH CAN BE SET, AND IF THE TIMER OPERATES  CONTINUOUSLY, OR ONLY WHILE THE BALL IS IN PLAY. GAMEPLAY PRIVILEGES QUICK RUNS, SHORT PASSES AND BLISTERING SHOTS OUTSIDE THE PENALTY BOX, AND SET PIECES ARE CONTROLLED BY MOVING A BOX INTO THE TARGET AREA FOR THE BALL, AND THEN PASSED, LOBBED OR KICKED DIRECTLY. ON THE TACTICAL SIDE, FORMATIONS CAN BE SELECTED, WITH 5 DIFFERENT STRATEGIES ALSO AVAILABLE (ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OF THESE COMBINATIONS MAKE SENSE) AS CAN THE TEAM COVERAGE - THE AREAS WHICH DEFENDERS, MIDFIELDERS AND STRIKERS COVER.</desc>

THERE WERE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT MADE FIFA96 STAND OUT FROM THE CROWD OF OTHER FOOTBALL SIMS. FIRSTLY, THE GAME'S COMMENTARY WAS REVOLUTIONARY AT THE TIME -- THE RENOWNED BRITISH COMMENTATOR JOHN MOTSON COMMENTS ALL THE INCIDENTS AND HAPPENINGS ON THE PITCH IN REAL-TIME. THE AMBIENT COMMENTARY IS VARIED, AND SYSTEMS WITH MORE THAN THE MINIMUM MEMORY LEVEL GET EXTRA COMMENTARY PHRASES.

THE VIRTUAL STADIUM TECHNOLOGY HAS NUMEROUS PRE-DEFINED CAMERA ANGLES. THE GAME EVEN HAS A SVGA MODE FOR BETTER-THAN-MINIMUM SYSTEM

FIFA96 BOASTS ELEVEN LEAGUES FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD, RANGING FROM THE UNKNOWN PLAYERS OF THE MALAYSIAN LEAGUE TO THE CELEBRATED STARS OF THE ENGLISH AND ITALIAN LEAGUES. 59 INTERNATIONAL TEAMS ARE ALSO FEATURED, AND IT'S POSSIBLE TO MATCH THE TEAMS YOU WANT TO AGAINST EACH OTHER THROUGH FRIENDLIES, OR YOU CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO PLAY DOMESTIC TOURNAMENTS OR INTERNATIONAL ONES SUCH AS THE WORLD CUP. IF YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE COMPOSITION OF THE VARIOUS TEAMS, YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN DREAM TEAM THROUGH THE CUSTOM TEAM CREATOR.</desc>

HOWEVER 4 MONSTERS HAVE TAKEN THE 4 ELEMENTAL CRYSTALS (EARTH, WATER, FIRE, WIND) FOR THEIR OWN USE, AND ALSO TAKEN THE 4 KEYS THAT FOR DOORS INSIDE OF FOCUS TOWER. WITH THE BALANCE DISRUPTED, DISASTERS BEFALL THE WORLD. A YOUNG BOY BY THE NAME OF BENJAMIN FINDS HIS HOME VILLAGE DESTROYED. MEETING A MYSTERIOUS OLD MAN WHILE TRYING TO ESCAPE FROM EARTHQUAKES, HE SOON LEARNS THAT HE IS THE PROPHESIZED HERO AND THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE THE WORLD. BENJAMIN MUST RECOVER THE 4 CRYSTALS, UNLOCK FOCUS TOWER AND DEFEAT THE ULTIMATE MONSTER BEFORE THE 5TH CRYSTAL, THE CRYSTAL OF LIFE IS CORRUPTED.

FINAL FANTASY: MYSTIC QUEST IS AN RPG GAME, SHOWN FROM AN OVERHEAD VIEW FOR MOVEMENT WITHIN AREAS AND USING A 3RD PERSON VIEW FOR BATTLES. THE GAME IS DIVIDED INTO "AREAS" ON THE WORLD MAP BETWEEN WHICH THE PLAYER CAN FREELY JUMP. THESE AREAS ARE DIVIDED INTO TOWNS, DUNGEONS AND BATTLE AREAS. TOWNS FEATURE CHARACTERS TO INTERACT AND TALK TO, DUNGEONS ARE MAZES FILLED WITH MONSTERS AND BATTLE AREAS ARE INSTANT BATTLES WITH SPECIFIC MONSTERS, COMPLETION OF WHICH SOMETIMES AWARDS SPECIAL ITEMS. INSIDE A DUNGEON OR TOWN, THE PLAYER MOVES FROM AN OVERHEAD VIEW, WITH HE ABILITY TO JUMP, USE WEAPON AT WHATEVER IS IN FRONT OF THE CHARACTER, INTERACT WITH NPCS AND ATTACK MONSTERS.

UNLIKE OTHER FINAL FANTASY GAMES, THERE ARE NO RANDOM BATTLES, ALL THE ENEMIES ARE VISIBLE TO THE PLAYER (OR IN SPECIFIC "BATTLE AREAS").  DURING BATTLE, THE GAME FEATURES TURN-BASED COMBAT (BUT NOT THE "ATB BATTLE SYSTEM" USED IN OTHER FINAL FANTASY GAMES) WHERE THE PLAYER CHOOSES FROM BATTLE COMMANDS SUCH AS ATTACK, DEFEND, ITEM AND SPELLS.

ALSO UNLIKE OTHER FINAL FANTASY GAMES, THE PLAYER'S PARTY ONLY EVER CONSISTS OF TWO CHARACTERS: BENJAMIN AND ANOTHER CHARACTER WHO CAN EITHER BY CONTROLLED MANUALLY OR AUTOMATICALLY BY THE AI. BENJAMIN CAN COLLECT ARMOR FOR 4 DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY AS WELL AS 4 DIFFERENT KINDS OF WEAPONS, HOWEVER THE OTHER PARTY MEMBER CANNOT HAVE THEIR EQUIPMENT CHANGED.

PLAYERS CAN SAVE AT ANY POINT IN THE GAME. IF THE PLAYER IS DEFEATED IN A BATTLE, THE GAME WILL LET THE BATTLE BE RETRIED, BUT ANY ITEMS USED WILL BE LOST.</desc>

		<desc>THIS IS THE FOURTH ENTRY IN THE  FINAL FANTASY SERIES. IT WAS KNOWN AS FINAL FANTASY II INTERNATIONALLY, BECAUSE THE  SECOND AND THIRD GAMES WERE NEVER RELEASED OUTSIDE OF JAPAN.

THE MILITARY COUNTRY OF BARON IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST IN THE LAND, WITH A PROUD ARMY AND A MAJESTIC AIR FORCE KNOWN AS THE RED WINGS. BUT, WHILE THEIR ARMIES ARE KIND AND LOYAL, THE RECENT ACTIONS OF THE KING ARE ANYTHING BUT. THE YOUNG CAPTAIN OF THE RED WINGS, CECIL, IS ORDERED TO STEAL A CRYSTAL FROM A VILLAGE OF INNOCENT MAGICIANS, AND WHEN HE QUESTIONS THE ACTIONS OF HIS KING, CECIL IS IMMEDIATELY THROWN OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND SENT OFF TO KILL STRANGE MONSTERS. LITTLE DOES HE REALIZE THE PRICE THE KING'S ACTIONS WILL PAY, AND WHAT THE TRUE SECRET OF THE CRYSTALS, AND THEIR POWERS, TRULY IS...

THIS IS THE FIRST FINAL FANTASY GAME THAT INTRODUCED THE FAMOUS ATB (ACTIVE-TIME BATTLE) SYSTEM: DURING THE BATTLES, YOU HAVE A TIME INDICATOR FOR EACH PARTY MEMBER THAT TELLS YOU WHEN THIS CHARACTER IS ABLE TO ACT. IF IT TAKES YOU TOO LONG TO SELECT A COMMAND FOR THIS CHARACTER, THE ENEMY WILL ACT WITHOUT WAITING FOR YOUR TURN. THE GAME ABANDONS THE JOB SYSTEM THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN THE  FIRST AND THE  THIRD GAME IN FAVOR OF PRE-SET CHARACTER CLASSES (PALADIN, WHITE MAGE, NINJA, ETC.) ASSIGNED TO EACH PARTY MEMBER.

THE PLAYSTATION VERSION ADDS A NEW RENDERED INTRO AND ENDING.</desc>

THEIR PLAN IS TO SEND YOU IN TO INFILTRATE THEIR BASE AND DESTROY THEM BEFORE THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO UNLEASH THE WAR UPON THE REST OF THE WORLD. YOU CAN CHOOSE TO CONTROL EITHER THE HELICOPTOR OR THE JEEP, WHICH HAVE DIFFERENT ADVANTAGES -- FOR INSTANCE, THE HELICOPTOR IS NOT OBSTRUCTED BY OBSTACLES BUT THE JEEP CAN FIRE IN ANY DIRECTION.

		<name>FireStriker</name>
		<desc>A LONG TIME AGO THE KINGDOMS OF WIND, FIRE, EARTH AND WATER
COMPETED FOR THE TRIALIGHT, A WEAPON CREATED BY THE ARCH MAGE WYLDE THAT CAN ONLY BE USED BY A FIRESTRIKER. THE KINGDOM OF WIND WON AND UNITED THE FOUR KINGDOMS. WYLDE HOWEVER, WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH PEACE AND CONJURED FOUR MONSTERS TO OVERTHROW THE UNITED WORLD. NOW, ONLY THE KINGDOM OF WIND REMAINS AND THE PLAYER TAKES CONTROL OVER THE LAST FIRESTRIKER TO FREE THE OTHER KINGDOMS AND DEFEAT THE MONSTERS.

EVEN THOUGH FIRESTRIKER LOOKS LIKE A TYPICAL SNES RPG, IT IS IN FACT AN ACTION GAME THAT HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH A PINBALL-GAME THAN WITH ANY OTHER GENRE. THE TRIALIGHT IS A BALL OF FIRE THAT BASICALLY BEHAVES LIKE A PINBALL. THE PLAYER CONTROLS THE FIRESTRIKER WHO CAN FREELY WALK ACROSS THE SCREEN AND STRIKE AT THE TRIALIGHT TO CONTROL ITS MOVEMENT. LEVELS ARE FILLED WITH OBSTACLES, DESTROYABLE BLOCK AND MONSTERS. MONSTERS AND BLOCKS CAN ONLY BE DESTROYED BY THE TRIALIGHT. THE GOAL OF EACH LEVEL IS TO MANEUVER THE TRIALIGHT TOWARDS THE EXIT OF THE SCREEN. THE EXIT IS USUALLY BLOCKED BY DESTROYABLE OBSTACLES AND SOMETIMES CERTAIN CONDITIONS (SUCH AS KILLING ALL MONSTERS OR DESTROYING CERTAIN OBJECTS) HAVE TO BE FULFILLED BEFORE A LEVEL CAN BE COMPLETED. IF THE FIRESTRIKER IS KILLED OR THE TRIALIGHT FALLS OFF THE SCREEN, THE PLAYER LOSES A LIFE. ADDITIONALLY TO THE FIRESTRIKER, THE PLAYER CAN USE THE SHOULDER BUTTONS TO CONTROL A MAGICIAN WHO (IN SINGLE PLAYER MODE) STAYS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. THE LEVELS CONSIST OF SEVERAL SCREENS AND ARE ENTERED FROM A WORLD MAP. AS THE GAME PROGRESSES, THE PLAYER WILL ALSO FIGHT SEVERAL BOSSES AND FREE OTHER FIRESTRIKERS WHOSE SPECIAL ABILITIES ARE NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE GAME.

FIRESTRIKER ALSO FEATURES A TWO-PLAYER COOPERATIVE MODE AS WELL AS A DUEL-MODE FOR UP TO FOUR PLAYERS.</desc>

		<desc>FEATURING HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION GEORGE FOREMAN, THIS IS A BOXING SIMULATION WHERE PLAYERS, TAKING THE ROLE OF FOREMAN, GO THROUGH A SERIES OF TWELVE ROUNDS AGAINST DIFFERENT BOXERS TO WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP TITLE BELT.

PLAYED FROM AN THIRD-PERSON PERSPECTIVE USING A VIEW FROM RIGHT OVER THE SHOULDERS OVER THE BOXER, PLAYERS CAN MOVE LEFT AND RIGHT TO DODGE INCOMING PUNCHES, BLOCK AND THROW LEFT AND RIGHT PUNCHES. THE STANDARD PUNCH IS A CROSS, BUT BY HOLDING THE UP-KEY PRESSED, JABS CAN ALSO BE THROWN.

BY AVOIDING PUNCHES AND HITTING THEM, A SUPERPUNCH OFTEN BECOMES AVAILABLE, INFLICTING MUCH MORE DAMAGE. A FIGHT CONSISTS OF A MAXIMUM OF THREE ROUNDS OF THREE MINUTES EACH. WHEN A BOXER IS KNOCKED DOWN FOUR TIMES, THE MATCH IS OVER (TECHNICAL KNOCK-OUT). THE SAME HAPPENS WHEN A BOXER GOES DOWN THREE TIMES IN A SINGLE ROUND (REGULAR KNOCK-OUT). WHEN DOWN, PLAYERS NEED TO PRESS BOTH PUNCH BUTTONS IN RAPID SUCCESSION TO GET BACK TO THEIR FEET. THE SCREEN SHOWS AN ENERGY METER DRAINED WHEN PUNCHES ARE RECEIVED. AFTER BEING KNOCKED DOWN AND DURING INTERMISSIONS, SOME ENERGY IS RESTORED.

ALL VERSIONS, EXCEPT FOR THE GAME BOY, CAN BE PLAYED WITH TWO PLAYERS. A PASSWORD SYSTEM IS USED TO SAVE THE PROGRESS.</desc>

HAVING MORE IN COMMON WITH MIDWAY'S ARCH RIVALS THAN ANY SANE HOCKEY SIMULATION, THIS ARENA IS NO PLACE FOR PENALTIES, AND NO PLACE FOR WIMPS. WHILE THE IDEA IS STILL TO SOMEHOW PUT THE PUCK INTO THE OPPOSING TEAM'S GOAL, EACH TEAM ONLY HAS THREE PLAYERS, THERE IS A HEAVY FOCUS ON CHECKING, AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO A "SUPER SHOT" WHICH IS STRONG ENOUGH TO SEND THE GOALIE INTO THE NET ALONG WITH THE PUCK.

AVAILABLE ARE EXHIBITION AND TOURNAMENT MODES FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS. TWO PLAYERS CAN EVEN TEAM UP TO TAKE ON THE COMPUTER. THE TURBOGRAFX-16 RELEASE ALSO ADDS A FOUR-PLAYER MODE, WHILE THE GAMEBOY VERSION ADDS A "SHOT RACE" MODE WHERE THE PLAYER MUST GET A CERTAIN NUMBER OF GOALS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.</desc>

SOCCER KID SEEMS LIKE A LOGICAL GAME TO 'INFLUENCE' A LICENSE OF A SHOW ABOUT BRILLIANT FOOTBALL PLAYERS. ARC DEVELOPMENTS AGREED. THE GAMEPLAY THUS HAS A FOOTBALL USED AS A WEAPON AGAINST ENCROACHING FOES. THERE ARE ROPES TO MOVE ACROSS, PRECISE JUMPS TO TIME, AND TRAPS TO AVOID.

IN THE HURRICANES THE BALL STICKS CLOSELY TO THE PLAYER'S FOOT, EVEN WHILE HE IS JUMPING. IT IS ONLY RELEASED WHEN PURPOSEFULLY KICKED, AND REPLACED IF IT HITS SOMETHING OR IS LOST. IT CAN BE FLICKED UP WHILE YOU ARE OFF THE GROUND.

THE LEVELS MOVE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT BUT ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT VERTICAL LEVELS, AND THERE IS OFTEN MORE THAN 1 POSSIBLE PATH, IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO GLOBAL GLADIATORS. POWER-UP TOKENS CAN BE COLLECTED AND TRADED IN. LOSING ONE OF YOUR 5 LIVES TAKES YOU BACK TOT HE LAST RESTART POINT - LOSING ONE OF YOUR CONTINUES TAKES YOU TO THE START OF THE WORLD.</desc>

		<name>J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings : Volume 1</name>
		<desc>UNLIKE MANY LORD OF THE RING GAMES THIS GAME WAS ACTUALLY PRODUCED MANY YEARS BEFORE THE LOTR HYPE AND BASED ON THE BOOK AND AN OLDER MOVIE. THOUGH THE TITLE SUGGESTS THERE SHOULD BE MORE VOLUMES, AS FAR AS I KNOW THE OTHER TWO WHERE NEVER PRODUCED.

IN THIS GAME YOU PLAY FRODO BAGGINS, A HOBBIT. THE GAME STARTS OFF AT BILBO'S 111 BIRTHDAY. YOUR FIRST QUEST IS TO FIND PIPPIN. IN YOUR QUEST YOU WILL NEED TO TAKE THE RING TO RIVENDELL. YOU START ALONE, BUT LATER ON YOU WILL GET OTHERS TO JOIN YOU IN YOUR QUEST, LIKE SAM AND GANDALF.

THE GAME WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED FOR THE NES, BUT RELEASE WAS HOLD OFF AND LATER ON ADAPTED FOR THE SNES. BECAUSE OF THE ORIGINAL GAME DESIGN GRAPHICS ARE SOMEWHAT NES LIKE AND NOT ALL BUTTONS OF THE CONTROLLER ARE USED. THE CARTRIDGE DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY RAM/BATTERY, GAMES CAN ONLY BE SAVED BY REMEMBERING A CODE. THE CODE MUST LATER BE ENTERED INTO THE GAME TO CONTINUE.</desc>

		<name>Jelly Boy</name>
		<desc>JELLY BOY IS A GELATINOUS HUMANOID PINK BLOB ON A MISSION THROUGHOUT SOME STRANGE WORLDS. HE TRAVELS THROUGHOUT SUCH LANDSCAPES AS GIANT TOY FACTORIES AND ARCTIC SNOWFIELDS DURING HIS QUEST, FACING DOWN ALL MANNER OF DANGEROUS ENEMIES AND OBSTACLES. HE CAN JUMP AND HE CAN  LAUNCH A LARGE FIST FROM HIS STOMACH (HE IS A BLOB, AFTER ALL). FURTHER, DIFFERENT LEVELS HAVE SPECIAL POWER-UPS THAT ALLOW THE BLOB TO ASSUME DIFFERENT FORMS THAT ARE USEFUL IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. THESE INCLUDE A HOT AIR BALLOON (FOR FLOATING UP TO SPECIAL ITEMS), A HAMMER (FOR SMASHING OBSTRUCTING BLOCKS), A SUBMARINE (FOR MORE EFFECTIVELY NAVIGATING AN UNDERSEA BONUS LEVEL), A SKATEBOARD (FOR BLAZING THROUGH A LEVEL ON A DEADLINE), AND A POGO STICK (FOR EXTRA HIGH JUMPING). NOT ALL OF THE POWER-UPS ARE USEFUL, THOUGH. ONE ITEM TURNS JELLY BOY INTO A BLOCK SO THAT HE IS UNABLE TO MOVE FOR SEVERAL SECONDS.

JELLY BOY COLLECTS MUSICAL NOTES IN LIEU OF HAVING A POWER METER. BEING HIT KNOCKS AWAY ALL OF HIS COLLECTED NOTES AND IF HE GETS HIT AGAIN WITHOUT HAVING ANY NOTES, HE WILL LOSE A LIFE. JELLY BOY ALSO COLLECTS A VARIETY OF FRUIT THROUGHOUT HIS QUEST. ACCUMULATE ENOUGH FRUIT TO EARN EXTRA LIVES. CERTAIN TYPES OF FRUIT HAVE OTHER SIDE EFFECTS (ORANGE = MORE TIME ON THE CLOCK, AVOCADO = INVINCIBILITY).</desc>

BIGGER ONES HAVE SUCH A HUGE BLAST RADIUS THAT BOMBUZAL CANNOT TRIGGER THEM DIRECTLY - INSTEAD, HE HAS TO EXPLODE SMALLER BOMBS FIRST AND CAUSE A CHAIN REACTION. SO AS ONE MIGHT IMAGINE, LATER LEVELS TURN INTO LOUD BLASTFESTS THAT NEED TO BE CAREFULLY PLANNED.

BESIDES, LATER LEVELS INTRODUCE ALL KINDS OF ADDITIONAL HAZARDS AND GIMMICKS, LIKE ICE FLOORS, MOVABLE BOMBS, DISAPPEARING GROUND TILES, AND MUCH MORE. NOBODY SAID BEING A PYROMANIAC IS EASY.</desc>

YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO TURN ON OR OFF WEATHER (DURING RAINY DAYS THE GRAPHICS ARE DARKER AND THE BIKE HAS LESS TRACTION). THE NUMBER OF LAPS ON EACH COURSE CAN BE 5, 10 OR 15, AND THERE ARE 4 SKILL LEVELS. SOME CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO HOW THE VEHICLE HANDLES, TO EMPHASIZE THE SWITCH FROM CARS TO BIKES.</desc>

KING ARTHUR &amp; THE KNIGHTS OF JUSTICE IS A TOP-DOWN ACTION GAME. IT MIGHT BE MISTAKEN FOR AN RPG, HOWEVER THE ABILITIES OF CHARACTERS DO NOT CHANGE OVER THE COURSE OF THE GAME.

THESE PARTY MEMBERS ARE COMPUTER CONTROLLED WITH THEIR OWN ENERGY BARS. ARTHUR CAN MOVE UP, DOWN, LEFT AND RIGHT, BLOCK WITH HIS SHIELD AND PARRY WITH HIS SHIELD.

THE STRENGTH BAR REPLENISHES ITSELF NATURALLY OVER TIME, BUT IS DEPLETED EVERY TIME ARTHUR SWINGS HIS SWORD. EACH KNIGHT INCLUDING ARTHUR HAS A HEALTH BAR, WHEN THIS BAR RUNS OUT, THE KNIGHT IS DEFEATED. IT CAN BE RESTORED BY RETURNING TO CAMELOT OR USING ITEMS SUCH AS HEALING HERBS. ARTHUR CAN CARRY A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ITEMS ACCESSIBLE FROM THE MENU. OTHER MENU FUNCTIONS INCLUDE LOOKING AT THE MAP, CHANGING PREFERENCES AND REVIEWING THE STATISTICS OF THE KNIGHTS.</desc>

		<name>Kirby Super Star</name>
		<desc>"KIRBY SUPER STAR" IS ANOTHER PLATFORMER IN THE KIRBY SERIES, DISTINGUISHED FOR HAVING AN UNUSUALLY VERSATILE CHARACTER, WHO CAN FLY AND GAIN THE ABILITIES OF HIS FOES.

THE GAME IS ACTUALLY A SET OF SEVEN MAIN GAMES: SPRING BREEZE, DYNABLADE, GOURMET RACE, THE GREAT CAVE OFFENSIVE ARE UNLOCKED AT FIRST, AND LATER METAKNIGHT'S REVENGE, MILKY WAY WISHES AND THE ARENA BECOME AVAILABLE, AS WELL AS A COUPLE OF MINOR MINIGAMES.

THESE ARE ALL TYPICAL KIRBY PLATFORMERS, EACH ONE WITH ITS OWN SET OF LEVELS AND DIFFERENT GAMEPLAY. IN MOST OF THEM YOU CAN CONSUME MONSTERS AND LEARN THEIR SPECIAL ABILITIES, BUT IN MILKY WAY WISHES ABILITIES ARE INSTEAD COLLECTED IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO METROID. OFFENSIVE CAVE FEATURES LEVELS WITH VARIOUS OBSTACLES, HIDDEN TREASURES AND SOME ELEMENTARY LEVER-PULLING KIND OF PUZZLE SOLVING. METAKNIGHT'S REVENGE IS THE ONLY GAME ON THE CARTRIDGE WITH A (FAIRLY STRICT) TIMER.  THE ARENA IS A "BOSS RUSH" MODE, ASKING PLAYERS TO DEFEAT EVERY BOSS IN THE GAME WITH LIMITED HEALTH REFILLS AND ON ONE LIFE.

KIRBY SUPER STAR IS BEST KNOWN FOR ITS TWO-PLAYER COOPERATIVE PLAY OPTION, WHICH HAS GIVEN IT A REPUTATION AS A PARTY GAME.</desc>

THE RACES ALSO FEATURE LOTS OF LOCAL DRIVERS (WHO CAN TAKE CRUCIAL POSITIONS AWAY FROM YOU AND THE OTHER CHAMPIONSHIP DRIVERS), SUNDAY DRIVERS GOING AT NORMAL SPEED, AND POLICE. BEFORE EACH RACE YOU WILL BE TOLD OF THE QUALITY OF THE LOCALS AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF POLICE PRESENCE.

WHEN POLICE ARE IN THE AREA, SPEEDING BEYOND 110 KM/H COULD SEE YOU BRANDED AS AN OFFENDER, AT WHICH POINT THE POLICE WILL TRY TO RAM YOU OFF THE ROAD, CHASE H.Q.-STYLE. YOU CAN ATTEMPT TO REACH THE END OF THE RACE DESPITE THIS DAMAGE (WHICH EVENTUALLY HAMPERS YOUR SPEED), OR SIMPLY PULL OVER AND ACCEPT A FINE AND THE LOSS OF RACE POINTS. IF THE POLICE SUBSEQUENTLY STOP YOU, THE FINE IS HEAVIER.

EACH RACE COSTS MONEY TO ENTER, AND YOUR EARNINGS CAN BE BOOSTED BY BETTING ON THE RESULTS WITH THE OTHER CHAMPIONSHIP DRIVERS. IF ONE OF YOU WINS, EACH DRIVER GIVES YOU EITHER THE AMOUNT THEY BET OR THE AMOUNT YOU BET, WHICHEVER IS LOWER; IF A LOCAL WINS YOU GET YOUR STAKE BACK.

LOTS OF POWER-UPS CAN BE BOUGHT ALONG THE WAY, INCLUDING TIRES, RADAR JAMMERS, ENGINE IMPROVEMENTS AND NITRO BOOSTS. TO MOVE UP A DIVISION YOU MUST TAKE THE DIVISIONAL CHALLENGE, A ONE-OFF TREK THROUGH A TOUGH SECTION WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT. YOU BUY A SET OF 3 PASSES FOR THIS, EACH ALLOWING ONE ATTEMPT.</desc>

THE LEMMINGS HAVE SPLIT INTO 12 DISTINCT TRIBES, EACH OF WHICH HAS THEIR OWN LANDSCAPE AND THEIR OWN CULTURAL IDENTITY - THEY INCLUDE EGYPTIAN, CIRCUS AND HIGHLAND. HOWEVER, LEMMING ISLAND IS NOW IN DANGER, AND YOU MUST COMPLETE 10 LEVELS FOR EACH TRIBE IN ORDER FOR THEM TO REUNITE AND REASSEMBLE THE TALISMAN FROM THE 12 PIECES.

ACROSS THE 120 LEVELS THERE ARE OVER 60 SKILLS, ALTHOUGH NO MORE THAN 10 ARE IN USE ON EACH SCREEN. THE CLASSIC TRIBE HAS THE ONES FORM THE ORIGINAL AND IS PERHAPS THE BEST OPTION FOR FIRST-TIME PLAYERS. 

THE OTHERS RANGE FROM DIGGING METHODS SUCH AS A SCOOPER (DIAGONALLY DOWNWARDS) AND CLUB BASHER (HORIZONTAL), BUILDING SKILLS SUCH AS A PLANTER (TAKES TIME TO PRODUCE THE DESIRED RAISE TO THE LANDSCAPE) AND A SAND POURER, AND VARIOUS METHODS OF MOVEMENT INCLUDING A POLE-VAULTER AND A SKATER (THE ONLY LEMMINGS WHO CAN CROSS ICE). SOME OF THESE ARE ONLY SUBTLY DIFFERENT TO OTHERS, AND THEIR EXACT USES ARE UNCLEAR, BUT THERE ARE 4 TRAINER LEVELS WHERE YOU CAN SELECT ANY COMBINATION OF SKILLS AND EXPERIMENT.

UNLIKE THE FIRST GAME, YOU ARE REWARDED FOR SAVING AS MANY LEMMINGS AS POSSIBLE, RATHER THAN SIMPLY PASSING OR FAILING. THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO SAVE ALL 60 LEMMINGS THROUGH ALL LEVELS, THEREBY EARNING A GOLD MEDAL FOR THAT TRIBE - SILVER AND BRONZE ARE ALSO ON OFFER. YOU CAN ALSO GO BACK OVER LEVELS IN THE HOPE OF SAVING MORE LEMS. 

BECAUSE THERE ARE 12 TRIBES, AND YOU CAN SWITCH BETWEEN THEM AT ANY POINT, YOU HAVE TO BE STUCK 12 TIMES IN ORDER TO BE UNABLE TO PROGRESS. THE GAME SAVES YOUR PROGRESS RATHER THAN USING PASSWORDS AS IN THE FIRST GAME.</desc>

WITHOUT THINKING, LESTER STRETCHED OUT ON A PALLET THAT WAS READY FOR LOADING ONTO A NEARBY FREIGHTER.  AND FELL ASLEEP.

BOY, DID HE PICK A BAD PLACE TO TAKE  A NAP.  SEVERAL HOURS OUT OF PORT HE WOKE UP AND FOUND HIMSELF IN DEEP TROUBLE (AND MORE THAN A LITTLE SEASICK).  THE SHIP'S CAPTAIN BELIEVED HIS STORY ABOUT BEING AN ACCIDENTAL STOWAWAY.  BUT... ONLY IN CASES OF EXTREME MEDICAL EMERGENCY COULD THE SHIP RETURN TO PORT.  AND LESTER WASN'T THAT SEASICK.  YET...

SO, HE WAS ALONG FOR THE RIDE...  UNTIL THE FIRST PORT OF CALL.  BUT AS CHANCE WOULD HAVE IT, PIRATES HIJACKED AND SCUTTLED THE FREIGHTER.  LUCKILY ENOUGH, LESTER FOUND A LIFE VEST BEFORE THE SHIP SANK AND SWAM FOR THE NEAREST TROPICAL ISLAND.

JUST BEFORE REACHING THE BEACH LESTER PASSED OUT FROM SHEER EXHAUSTION.  NOW, HIS REAL ADVENTURE BEGINS...

IT IS UP TO YOU TO HELP LESTER GET BACK HOME.

		<desc>STORY
THE EUROPEAN WARS AGAINST SPAIN AND FRANCE HAVE BEEN COSTLY TO THE BRITISH EMPIRE. IN ORDER TO GAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THE WAR EFFORT, THE CROWN RAISE TAXES FROM THE NEW WORLD COLONIES WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. THIS ACT COMPELS THE NEW WORLD COLONIES TO PROTEST AND BOYCOTT AGAINST BRITISH RULE. BY 1775, THE CROWN ALARMED BY THE PROTESTS, BOYCOTTS AND POLITICALLY INSTABILITY IN THE NEW WORLD SENDS TROOPS TO SUBDUE ANY REBELLIOUS EFFORTS BY THE NEW WORLD COLONISTS. THIS THREATENING APPROACH PROVOKES THE THIRTEEN COLONIES TO REVOLT. THUS STARTS THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE IN THE NEW WORLD (AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR).

GAMEPLAY
CHOOSING SIDES
IN LIBERTY OR DEATH, YOU PARTAKE IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR, EITHER AS THE "REBELS" - THE AMERICAN CONTINENTAL ARMY OR AS THE "CROWN" - THE BRITISH ROYAL ARMY.

CHOOSING EITHER ONE OF THE NATIONS WILL PROMPT YOU TO CHOOSE THE LEADING COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF:

THE CONTINENTAL ARMY: CHARLES LEE, ARTEMAS WARD OR GEORGE WASHINGTON.
THE BRITISH ROYAL ARMY: HENRY CLINTON, THOMAS GAGE OR WILLIAM HOWE.

REVOLUTIONARY POLITICS
EACH TURN YOU WILL HAVE TO BALANCE YOUR TREASURY FOR THE WAR EFFORT. MONEY IS PROVIDED BY EACH STATE. THE MORE STATES THAT SUPPORT YOUR CAUSE, THE MORE MONEY WILL FLOW IN YOUR COFFERS. MONEY IS SPENT IN PAYING WAGES, STRENGTHENING THE FLEET AND RECRUITING NEW REGIMENTS.

HERE, IF YOU HAVE A SUFFICIENT FLEET, YOU CAN ALSO COMMAND YOUR NAVY OFFICER TO "CONTROL THE SEAS" WHICH IS CONDUCTING A BLOCKADE AND PRIVATEERING AGAINST ENEMY SHIPS. THIS MAY RESULT IN SEIZED GOODS THAT WILL BE ADDED TO YOUR TREASURY. 

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR IN LIBERTY OR DEATH INCLUDED EVERYONE EXCEPT THE AMERICAN INDIANS: [1] REVOLUTIONARY MILITIA: AMERICAN SUPPORTERS BUT NOT YET FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF CONTINENTAL ARMY (NOT UNDER YOUR FULL CONTROL) [2] LOYALIST MILITIA: MILITIA SUPPORTIVE TO THE CROWN [3] FRENCH ARMY: THE FRENCH WILL SUPPORT THE AMERICAN CAUSE AFTER A FORMAL ALLIANCE IS HELD. [4] SPANISH ARMY: THE SPANIARDS WILL SUPPORT THE AMERICAN CAUSE AFTER A FORMAL ALLIANCE IS HELD.

REVOLUTIONARY COMBAT
THE TOP-DOWN TURNED BASED COMBAT INTRODUCES UNITS AVAILABLE IN THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR: INFANTRY, GUERRILLA, CAVALRY AND ARTILLERY (ENGINEERS). COMBAT NEAR SHORES MAY ALSO BE JOINED BY NAVAL UNITS: FLEET AND FIRES SHIPS.</desc>

		<desc>THE LOONEY TUNES WORK HARD AT WARNER BROS. STUDIOS ACTING IN CARTOONS FOR ALL TO ENJOY. IT'S TOUGH WORK, AND AFTERWARDS THEY JUST WANT TO RELAX AND MAYBE SHOOT A FEW HOOPS IN THE PARKING LOT. OF COURSE THEY CAN'T ENTIRELY LEAVE THEIR WILD ANTICS INSIDE THE STUDIO, AND WILL CERTAINLY BRING SOME KIND OF ZANY ONTO THE BASKETBALL COURT.

LOONEY TUNES B-BALL IS A 2-ON-2 BASKETBALL GAME, SIMILAR TO THE MORE WELL KNOWN NBA JAM. HOWEVER, LOONEY TUNES IS MUCH MORE INFORMAL AND SILLY, THOUGH THIS LEVEL OF SILLINESS IS SET BY THE PLAYER VIA THE WACKINESS METER ON THE MAIN MENU. PLAYERS CHOOSE THEIR TEAMS FROM THE LIKES OF: BUGS BUNNY, DAFFY DUCK, ELMER FUDD, WILE E. COYOTE, TASMANIAN DEVIL, SYLVESTER, YOSEMITE SAM AND MARVIN MARTIAN. EACH PLAYER HAS UNIQUE STATISTICS FOR THEIR SHOOTING, 3-POINTERS, DEFENSE, STAMINA AND SPEED.

ONCE ON THE COURT, THE PLAYER CAN PASS THE BALL, SHOOT THE BALL, GRAB A BURST OF SPEED OR UNLEASH A SPECIAL DEFENSIVE ABILITY OR A SPECIAL OFFENSIVE ABILITY.. THESE ABILITIES INCLUDE CREAM PIES, TIME BOMBS, STICKS OF DYNAMITE AND OTHER FUN TOYS FROM THE ACME CORPORATION. OFFENSIVE ABILITIES MUST BE "BOUGHT" BY COLLECTING GEMS AND OTHER ITEMS WHICH OCCASIONALLY SHOW UP ON THE BASKETBALL COURT.</desc>

		<desc>AS THE HERO, YOU MUST CLIMB UP A MONSTER-RIDDEN TOWER TO DEFEAT DROKKMAR, MASTER OF THE BLACKORB. TO DO THIS, YOU MUST DEFEAT HIS ARMY THAT STANDS IN YOUR WAY WITH WHATEVER WEAPON YOU ARE CARRYING. HEALTH IS DECREASED BY COMING INTO CONTACT WITH VARIOUS MONSTERS, ATTACKS, TRAPS, AND THE PASSAGE OF TIME. IT IS INCREASED BY FINDING FOOD. EVERY CERTAIN AMOUNT OF POINTS, A "FOOD FAIRY" APPEARS AND DROPS OFF FOOD AS WELL.

THROUGHOUT YOUR JOURNEY, YOU CAN SMASH OPEN CHESTS TO FIND TREASURE AND ARTIFACTS. SOME OF THESE ARTIFACTS CAN BE RECOVERED THAT ALTER GAMEPLAY, SUCH AS PROVIDING MORE DAMAGE OR INCREASED MAGICAL POWER. ALSO THROUGHOUT YOUR JOURNEY, YOU CAN COLLECT KEYS, WHICH ARE USED TO FREE IMPRISONED ALLIES, WHO NOT ONLY HELP YOU DEFEAT MONSTERS, BUT ALSO LEAVE YOU AN ITEM THAT WILL HELP YOU ON YOUR QUEST. ONLY ONE PERSON CAN JOIN YOU AT A TIME.

AS YOU PROGRESS THROUGH THE TOWER, YOU WILL BE GRANTED NEW MAGICAL WEAPONS AFTER EACH BOSS YOU DEFEAT. THE WEAPONS ARE AFFECTED BY A "MAGIC BAR" THAT CHARGES OVER TIME. WHEN THIS BAR IS FULLY CHARGED, THE WEAPON HAS A POWERFUL RANGED ATTACK, BUT WHEN NOT CHARGED ONLY A CLOSE ATTACK IS PRODUCED. A MAGICAL STAFF WILL GRANT INCREASED RANGE ATTACK ABILITY. A MAGICAL BLAST MAY BE GENERATED BY JUMPING AND ATTACKING, BUT DOING THIS COSTS HEALTH.

THERE ARE MULTIPLE PATHS IN THE GAME, AND TWO SEPARATE ENDINGS. HIDDEN DOORS CAN BE USED TO SKIP LEVELS WHEN FOUND - USUALLY BY ATTACKING A WALL OR A PARTICULAR SPOT.</desc>

		<name>Math Blaster : Episode 1</name>
		<desc>A FOLLOW-UP TO THE ORIGINAL MATH BLASTER! GAMES, MATH BLASTER: IN SEARCH OF SPOT IS AN EDUCATIONAL TITLE WITH ARCADE ELEMENTS DESIGNED TO HELP STUDENTS LEARN MATHS WHILE HAVING FUN.

THE GAME ALLOWS STUDENTS TO PRACTICE BASIC ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, AND DIVISION SKILLS IN ADDITION TO FRACTIONS, DECIMALS, PERCENTS, ESTIMATION, AND NUMBER PATTERNS. THE SUBJECTS CAN BE PRACTICED SEPARATELY OR TOGETHER IN REVIEW. SIX LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY ARE PROVIDED. LIKE THE PREVIOUS TITLES, THE GAME ALSO INCLUDES AN EDITOR TO CREATE NEW PROBLEM SETS (PRESENT IN THE PC VERSION ONLY).

MATH BLASTER'S FRIEND AND ASSISTANT, SPOT, IS KIDNAPPED BY THE EVIL TRASH ALIEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME. THE GALACTIC COMMANDER GIVES MATH BLASTER THE MISSION TO FOLLOW THE TRASH ALIEN TO HIS HOME PLANET AND RESCUE SPOT.

THE GAME STARTS WITH A COMPLETE MISSION (STORY MODE). THE MISSION CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF FOUR (THREE IN THE CONSOLE VERSIONS) MATH ACTIVITIES (MINI-GAMES) STRUNG TOGETHER WITH CUT-SCENES. THE ACTIVITIES CAN ALSO BE PLAYED SEPARATELY, FOR PRACTICE OR FOR SCORE.

THE ACTIVITIES ARE AS FOLLOWS:

1. TRASH ZAPPER - SOLVE EQUATIONS TO GAIN TRACTOR BEAM POWER, THEN USE THE TRACTOR BEAM TO COLLECT SPACE TRASH.

2. NUMBER RECYCLER (PC VERSION ONLY) - CREATE EQUATIONS BY PUSHING AROUND COLUMNS OF NUMBERS AND OPERATORS. CORRECT EQUATIONS ALLOW YOU TO TURN THE TRASH YOU COLLECTED INTO FUEL.

3. CAVE RUNNER - USE MATH BLASTER'S JET PACK TO FLY THROUGH A CAVE. HE HAS A NUMBER ON HIS CHEST, AND IT MUST BE ARITHMETICALLY BETWEEN THE NUMBERS ON EACH SIDE OF AN OPENING IN ORDER FOR HIM TO PASS THROUGH. DROPLETS OF WATER FALLING FROM ABOVE CAN CHANGE THIS NUMBER BY PERFORMING AN OPERATION ON IT. THERE ARE ALSO GEMS WHICH CAN BE COLLECTED FOR BONUS POINTS, AND IN HIGHER LEVELS, MONSTERS APPEAR THAT CAN KNOCK MATH BLASTER DOWN.

4. MATH BLASTER - THE TRASH ALIEN'S SPACESHIP DISPLAYS AN EQUATION, AND THE FOUR PORTHOLES SERVE AS MULTIPLE-CHOICE ANSWERS. USE THE JET PACK TO FLY INTO THE CORRECT PORTHOLES WHILE AVOIDING FLOATING TRASH AND ENERGY BLASTS FROM THE SHIP. BONUS GEMS ALSO APPEAR AT RANDOM, AND AFTER FIVE PROBLEMS A BONUS ROUND OCCURS WHERE PLAYERS GET A CHANCE TO COLLECT AS MANY GEMS AS THEY CAN WITHIN A TIME LIMIT.

UPON FINISHING THE COMPLETE MISSION, THE PLAYER IS PRESENTED WITH A CERTIFICATE THAT CAN BE PRINTED OUT (PC VERSION ONLY). THEIR FINAL SCORE IS ALSO ADDED TO A HIGH SCORE BOARD FOR THEIR ACCOUNT.</desc>

		<desc>YOU ARE GIDEON BRAVER VANDENBURG, HEIR TO THE PLANET. WHILE YOU WERE AWAY, UNKNOWN ATTACKERS DESTROYED YOUR HOME, KILLED YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY, AND STOLE THE CHALICE THAT YOU NEED TO WIN THE THRONE. WHEN YOU ARE IMPLICATED IN YOUR OWN FAMILY'S DEATH, YOU ARE FORCED INTO EXILE. WITH A HELP OF AN OLD FRIEND WHO CONTRIBUTED AN OLD JENNER AND SOME CREDITS, YOU MUST BECOME A MERCENARY. YOU MUST TRAVEL THE INNER SPHERE IN SEARCH OF CLUES TO WHO SET YOU UP, AND EVENTUALLY AVENGE YOUR FAMILY AND RECOVER THE CHALICE. YOU HAVE FIVE YEARS. GOOD LUCK AND GOOD HUNTING. 

MECHWARRIOR WAS THE FIRST 3D BATTLETECH GAME DEVELOPED. DYNAMIX (WHO LATER DEVELOPED THE STARSIEGE SERIES) CREATED IT FOR ACTIVISION. YOU GO TO A PLANET AND IN SEARCH OF "FIXERS" WHO WILL SET UP SOME CONTRACTS WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THE TERMS ARE A FLAT PAYMENT AND SOME SALVAGE PAYMENTS. SOME HOUSES ARE VERY STINGY BUT THEY TELL YOU A LOT ABOUT THE MISSION. OTHERS PAY WELL BUT MAY NOT TELL YOU EVERYTHING. YOU CAN BUY/SELL/REPAIR 'MECHS, HIRE/FIRE PILOTS, DECIDE WHICH PLANET TO MOVE TO, AS YOU TRY TO MAINTAIN DECENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL FIVE HOUSES OF THE INNER SPHERE, WHILE TRYING TO UNCOVER CLUES ABOUT WHERE YOU NEED TO GO. THIS GROUND-BREAKING GAME IS VERY REPLAYABLE, AS EACH MISSION IS RANDOMLY GENERATED. THERE'S EVEN SOME EXTENDED CAMPAIGNS WHERE YOU RUN 2-3 MISSIONS IN A ROW. 

(THE FOLLOWING IS THE PLOT FROM THE SNES VERSION OF MECHWARRIOR.)
YOU ARE HERRAS RAGEN. WHEN YOU WERE 12 (3017) YOUR FATHER COLONEL JOSEPH T. RAGEN, A SOLDIER IN THE HOUSE DAVION ARMY, WAS WORKING TO INFILTRATE AND DESTROY A RENEGADE MERCENARY CARTEL CALLED THE DARK WING LANCE AND HE HAD GOT IN OVER HIS HEAD.  SOMEHOW THE MEMBERS OF THE CARTEL GOT THE LOCATION OF YOUR FAMILY'S HOUSE ON REDONDO LEAKED TO THEM FROM AN UNKNOWN SOURCE. BEFORE MAKING THEIR COVERT STRIKE THE LANCE MADE AN AGREEMENT THAT THEY WOULD SEPARATE FOR 10 YEARS AND MAINTAIN AN ABSOLUTE CODE OF SECRECY BEFORE REGROUPING AGAIN TO CONTINUE THEIR NEFARIOUS OPERATIONS.

ONE NIGHT THE LANCE ATTACKED YOUR FAMILIES HOME KILLING EVERYONE INSIDE.  OVER AT A FRIEND'S YOU HEARD SOUNDS OF EXPLOSIONS. RUSHING HOME YOU FOUND A ROARING INFERNO OF WHAT USED TO BE THE HOME YOU GREW UP WITH YOUR FAMILY. NEWLY ORPHANED YOU VOWED REVENGE ON WHOEVER HAD DONE THIS.

THE YEAR IS 3027. NOW A YOUNG MAN, YOU CANNOT SERVE HOUSE DAVION AFTER WHAT HAPPENED ALL THOSE YEARS AGO. NOW YOU MAKE YOUR LIVING WORKING AS A FREELANCE MERCENARY ON THE PLANET GALATEA SELLING YOUR SERVICES TO ANYONE WHOSE CONTRACT WILL LEAD YOU CLOSER TO THE INSIDIOUS DARK WING LANCE.</desc>

		<desc>FIRST YOU CHOOSE ONE OUT OF FOUR DIFFERENT CHARACTERS TO REPRESENT YOU, SCARLET (RED ARMY), OBERON (YELLOW ARMY), CAESAR (GREEN ARMY), OR MADCAP (BLUE ARMY). THE GAME IS SPLIT INTO 10 LEVELS - THE FIRST 9 ARE GROUPS OF 3 TERRITORIES WHICH CAN BE COMPLETED IN ANY OTHER, WHILE THE FINAL 'MOTHER OF ALL BATTLES' HAS ITS OWN SURPRISES. 

LAND IS MOSTLY OF SAND, GRASS OR ICE. YOU START WITH 100 MEN AND YOU CAN USE WHATEVER QUANTITY YOU FIND NECESSARY ON EACH ISLAND. THE REST MEN LEFT WILL GO TO ANOTHER LEVEL WITH ANOTHER NEW 100. IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE GAME YOU CAN FREEZE MEN TO SAVE THEM FOR THE MOTHER OF ALL BATTLES.
 
ONCE YOU SELECT YOUR ISLAND AND PLACE FOR YOUR HQ, YOU MUST DO SOME RESEARCH FOR BETTER WEAPONS AND DEFENCES. ON THE ROOF OF YOUR BUILDINGS YOU CAN PUT PROTECTORS LIKE ARCHERS, GUNMEN, BOILING OIL MEN, AND LATER ON EVEN LASER TURRETS. IF YOU SEND A TEAM OF UNARMED MEN INTO AN UNOCCUPIED SQUARE, THEY WILL BUILD AN ADDITIONAL BASE THERE, WITH LARGER ARMIES COMPLETING THIS MORE QUICKLY.

LATER ON HIGHER LEVELS, YOU'LL ALSO BUILD MINES AND FACTORIES, AS YOU'LL NEED TO DIG A CERTAIN MATERIAL FOR HIGHER LEVEL WEAPONS, DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE AREA YOU'RE ON IS RICH WITH A CERTAIN MATERIAL OR NOT. WITH EACH NEXT LEVEL, YOU'LL START FROM A HIGHER TECHNOLOGY LEVEL AND BE ABLE TO PROGRESS TO ONE HIGHER LEVEL UP THEN THE AT PREVIOUS LEVEL.

IF THERE IS MORE THEN JUST ONE ENEMY, YOU CAN MAKE AN ALLIANCE UNTIL YOU CRUSH THE OTHER ONE - THREE OF YOU CAN FORM AN ALLIANCE AGAINST FOURTH ENEMY. FOR WHAT ITS WORTH, A CERTAIN NUMERIC LEVEL OF DEFENCE IS ALWAYS STRONGER FROM THE SAME LEVEL OF ATTACKER, AND MEN THAT ARE NOT ARMED (CONSCRIPTS) CAN ONLY KILL ENEMY SOLDIERS, NOT DESTROY OR ATTACK ENEMY FORT.

THE MAIN THING AS IT ALWAYS IS IN STRATEGY GAMES IS TO BE THE SOLE SURVIVOR AND LEAD YOUR MEN TO VICTORY, EXPERIMENTING ON VICIOUS TECHNOLOGIES, EQUIPPING YOUR MEN, MAKING A PERFECT SOLDIERS OUT OF THEM, PRODUCE SHIELDS, WEAPONS, PLANES... TO DOMINATE THE WORLD AND CRUSH YOUR OPPONENTS. 

YOU CAN DO THE BATTLING ONLY IN A CERTAIN QUADRANT, BUT DON'T BE LONG AS YOUR MEN WILL AUTOMATICALLY START BUILDING THE FORT, AND IT WILL BE AT THE BOTTOM OF AGE LEVEL AND YOU'LL NEED TO INVENT EVERYTHING FOR THAT ONE AGAIN.</desc>

		<desc>FOLLOWING THE EVENTS OF BATTLE CLASH, THE BATTLE GAME CHIEFS HAD BEEN DEFEATED. BUT THE WORLD DID NOT RETURN TO PEACE AND INSTEAD NEW CHIEFS AND NEW MACHINES ROSE UP TO RULE THE WORLD. LIKE BEFORE, THE CHIEFS USE GIANT ROBOTS KNOWN AS STANDING TANKS (STS). SEEING THE WORLD IN TROUBLE, THE HERO PILOTS WHO HAD DEFEATED THE BATTLE CHIEFS DECIDE TO ONCE AGAIN ENTER THE BATTLE GAME USING AN IMPROVED VERSION OF THEIR ST, THE FALCON. THE TRUTH BEHIND THE BATTLE GAME WILL TAKE THE FALCON DEEP INTO SPACE...

METAL COMBAT: FALCON'S REVENGE IS A FIRST PERSON SHOOTER DESIGNED FOR THE SUPER SCOPE LIGHT GUN. GAMEPLAY IS IDENTICAL TO BATTLE CLASH. THE PLAYER TAKES THE ROLE OF THE GUNNER OF THE GIANT ROBOT, MOVEMENT IS HANDLED AUTOMATICALLY BY THE GAME, SCROLLING THE SCREEN. PLAYERS MUST KEEP THE ENEMY ROBOT IN THE GUNSIGHTS AND BLAST AWAY AT DIFFERENT PARTS OF IT, WHILE ALSO INTERCEPTING ENEMY MISSILES AND COUNTER-ATTACKS. ALL ROBOTS HAVE A WEAK POINT THAT WILL INCREASE THE DAMAGE DONE TO THEM. POWER-UPS SUCH AS NEUTRON BEAMS AND PLASMA BOMBS CAN BE PICKED UP FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF CERTAIN STAGES, AND EQUIPPED AT THE BEGINNING OF COMBAT.</desc>

		<desc>THE ANTIMATTER COLD WAR HAS LEFT EARTH RUINED AS THE STOCKPILED AM WEAPONS OF VARIOUS NATIONS WERE TRIGGERED IN A CHAIN EFFECT, VAPORIZING LARGE PORTIONS OF THE EARTH. THE ONCE GREAT CONTINENTS HAVE BEEN DRASTICALLY CHANGED INTO THOUSANDS OF TINY ISLANDS AND VARIOUS CITIES HAVE WASHED INTO THE OCEANS.  DURING THIS TURMOIL,  ZORGEUF THE GREAT RUSHES TO CONQUER THE BEWILDERED WORLD ALONG WITH A TROOP OF COMMANDERS AND DECLARES THE EARTH EMPIRE. THE ONLY HOPE TO DEFEAT HIM LIES FROM WITHOUT EARTH, AS THE COLONIAL FORCES SEND A COMMAND CARRIER FROM THE MAJOR ORBITAL BASE. WITH SO MANY ARMIES GONE, THE GROUND INFANTRY UNIT HAS BEEN REPLACED BY THE METAL MARINE, A FIFTY FOOT ARMORED ROBOT THAT CAN BE SENT INTO BATTLE FOR ATTACK OR DEFENSE. FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMAND CENTER, EACH SIDE IN THE CONFLICT WILL NEED TO DIRECT THE PLACEMENT OF FACILITIES ON THE GROUND TO DEFEND AGAINST ENEMY ATTACK, MANAGE RESOURCES AND SUCCESSFULLY STRIKE THE ENEMY.

METAL MARINES IS AN ISOMETRIC STRATEGY GAME. CONTROLLING ONE SIDE OF A CONFLICT, THE PLAYER MUST WAGE A CAMPAIGN ACROSS SEVERAL ISLANDS TO DEFEAT ZORGEUF AND HIS LIEUTENANTS. THE PLAYER CONTROLS LOGISTICS OF THE BASE TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE THE NECESSARY ASSETS TO WAGE WAR. ON EACH MAP, THE PLAYER PLACES THREE UNDERGROUND COMMAND BASES, IF ALL OF THESE ARE DESTROYED THE BATTLE IS LOST.  THE PLAYER MUST MANAGE THE RESOURCES OF THEIR MONEY TO CONSTRUCT NEW BUILDINGS OR UPGRADE EXISTING FACILITIES ON THE MAP. DIFFERENT BUILDINGS INCLUDE ENERGY PLANTS, FACTORIES, ECONOMIC CENTERS, RADAR SYSTEMS, ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES, FAKE BUILDINGS AND FAKE HQ BASES, MINE FIELDS, GUN PODS, MISSILE LAUNCHERS, METAL MARINE HANGERS AND EVEN ICBMS.  AT ANY TIME, THE PLAYER MAY ORDER AN ATTACK AND CHOOSE WHICH ASSETS TO FIRE AT THE OPPONENT. MISSILES, METAL MARINES CARRIERS AND ICBMS ALL USE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FUEL. METAL MARINES ONCE DEPLOYED IN AN AREA WILL AUTOMATICALLY FIRE RIFLES AT NEARBY TARGETS OR ENGAGE EVEN CLOSER TARGETS IN MELEE ATTACKS. GUNPODS, WHILE STATIONARY, WILL ALSO FIRE ON NEARBY ENEMIES. METAL MARINES ARE LARGELY AUTONOMOUS BUT CAN BE MANUALLY CONTROLLED TO A MINOR DEGREE (DIRECTIONAL) BY THE PLAYER.</desc>

MICKEY'S ULTIMATE CHALLENGE IS A PUZZLE GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYER CHOOSES EITHER MICKEY OR MINNIE TO PLAY WITH. THEY'LL FIND FIVE CHARACTERS FROM THE DISNEY'S UNIVERSE IN THE KINGDOM, AND WILL BE PROMPTED TO HELP THEM IN SEVERAL TASKS.

EACH TASK IS A DIFFERENT PUZZLE, GIVEN BY A SPECIFIC CHARACTER. DAISY, FOR INSTANCE, WILL ASK HELP TO CLEAN THE CASTLE'S PAINTINGS HANGING ON A WALL. THE TASK IS IN FACT A MEMORY GAME, WHERE MICKEY OR MINNIE MUST CLEAN THE PICTURES MATCHING PAIRS. AFTER COMPLETING ONE TASK, THEY'LL RECEIVE A GIFT.

AFTER COMPLETING ALL TASKS, MICKEY OR MINNIE MUST TRADE THE GIFTS THEY WON WITH THE RIGHT CHARACTERS. FOR INSTANCE, AFTER FINISHING GOOFY'S TASK, THEY WILL RECEIVE HIS HAMMER. THE PLAYER MUST THEN GUESS WHO AMONG THE OTHER CHARACTERS WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE THAT HAMMER.

GIVING THE RIGHT ITEMS TO THE RIGHT CHARACTERS WILL ALLOW MICKEY OR MINNIE ACCESS TO THE LAST PUZZLE AND CHARACTER.</desc>

IT INVOLVES RACING MINIATURES REPRESENTING PARTICULAR VEHICLE TYPES ACROSS A PARTICULAR TERRAIN FOUND AROUND THE HOUSE. THE SPORTS CARS RACE ON THE DESKTOP, 4X4S IN THE SANDPIT, FORMULA 1 CARS ON A SNOOKER TABLE, AND SO ON.

THESE LEVELS WERE PACKED WITH VARIATION. THE SNOOKER TABLES HAS THE TRACK PAINTED ON, ALTHOUGH THIS IS OPEN TO DEVIATION (AS ARE MOST LEVELS), AND HAD YOU RACING THROUGH THE POCKETS AND ACROSS THE RIM OF THE TABLE. TANKS RACED AS WELL, WITH THE CHANCE OF SHOOTING OUT YOUR OPPONENT IF THEY GOT DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF YOU. THE DESKTOP LEVELS INCLUDE BINDERS TO JUMP ACROSS, PENCIL-SHARPENERS TO AVOID, AND LOTS OF VISUAL JOKES IN THE OPEN HOMEWORK.

VIEWED FROM OVERHEAD WITH SMALL GRAPHICS, THE RACES INCLUDE UP TO 4 CARS. IN ONE PLAYER CHALLENGE MODE YOU RACE THROUGH THE 21 TRACKS IN A SET ORDER, SELECTING YOUR 3 OPPONENTS AS YOU GO ALONG (ADDING A FAIR AMOUNT OF STRATEGY - IDEALLY YOU SHOULD AIM TO ELIMINATE THE BETTER CPU CARS EARLY ON), ELIMINATING ONE AFTER EVERY THIRD RACE (ASSUMING THAT YOU CAN FINISH IN THE TOP 2 OF A RACE WITHIN YOUR 3 LIVES). IF YOU WIN 3 RACES IN A ROW WITHOUT USING A CONTINUE YOU GET A TIME-TRIAL RACE WHICH CAN EARN YOU AN EXTRA LIFE.

THE REAL INNOVATION OF THE GAME WAS IN THE MULTIPLAYER MODES. YOU STARTED WITH 4 POINTS EACH, AND WHEN ONE CAR GETS FAR ENOUGH AHEAD TO FORCE THE OTHER CAR OFF-SCREEN, THE SLIDER MOVES IN THEIR FAVOUR. ONCE IT REACHED THE END (WHICH INVOLVED BEATING THEM 4 TIMES MORE THAN THEY BEAT YOU) YOU WIN THE LEVEL, ALTHOUGH IF 3 LAPS WERE COMPLETED, THE PERSON LEADING AT THAT POINT IS DECLARED THE WINNER - WITH A SUDDEN DEATH PLAY OFF IF SCORES ARE LEVEL. 9 OF THE TRACKS ARE AVAILABLE IN THIS MODE, ALTHOUGH YOU CAN ALSO PLAY THIS HEAD TO HEAD SYSTEM AS A 1-PLAYER GAME ACROSS ALL THE TRACKS.</desc>

IN ONE PLAYER CHALLENGE MODE YOU RACE THROUGH THE 21 TRACKS IN A SET ORDER, SELECTING YOUR 3 OPPONENTS AS YOU GO ALONG (ADDING A FAIR AMOUNT OF STRATEGY - IDEALLY YOU SHOULD AIM TO ELIMINATE THE BETTER CPU CARS EARLY ON), ELIMINATING ONE AFTER EVERY THIRD RACE (ASSUMING THAT YOU CAN FINISH IN THE TOP 2 OF A RACE WITHIN YOUR 3 LIVES). IF YOU WIN 3 RACES IN A ROW WITHOUT USING A CONTINUE YOU GET A TIME-TRIAL RACE WHICH CAN EARN YOU AN EXTRA LIFE.

THE REAL INNOVATION OF THE GAME WAS IN THE MULTIPLAYER MODES. YOU STARTED WITH 4 POINTS EACH, AND WHEN ONE CAR GETS FAR ENOUGH AHEAD TO FORCE THE OTHER CAR OFF-SCREEN, THE SLIDER MOVES IN THEIR FAVOUR. ONCE IT REACHED THE END (WHICH INVOLVED BEATING THEM 4 TIMES MORE THAN THEY BEAT YOU) YOU WIN THE LEVEL, ALTHOUGH IF 3 LAPS WERE COMPLETED, THE PERSON LEADING AT THAT POINT IS DECLARED THE WINNER - WITH A SUDDEN DEATH PLAY OFF IF SCORES ARE LEVEL. 9 OF THE TRACKS ARE AVAILABLE IN THIS MODE, ALTHOUGH YOU CAN ALSO PLAY THIS HEAD TO HEAD SYSTEM AS A 1-PLAYER GAME ACROSS ALL THE TRACKS.</desc>

A BALANCED PARTY IS A NECESSITY IN THIS GAME. THERE ARE SEVERAL LOCATIONS AND ITEMS THAT ARE RESTRICTED TO CERTAIN GENDERS, ALIGNMENTS, OR RACES. A PARTY MADE UP OF GOOD HUMAN MALES WON'T GET YOU VERY FAR. TIME PLAYS A LARGE ROLE IN THIS GAME.

		<name>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers : The Fighting Edition</name>
		<desc>MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS: THE FIGHTING EDITION IS A GAME DIRECTLY BASED ON THE WORLD-KNOWN TELEVISION SERIES. IN THIS GAME, YOU CAN CHOICE AMONG 8 PLAYABLE CHARACTERS: THE POWER RANGERS' ZORDS (THUNDER MEGAZORD, MEGA TIGERZORD, NINJA MEGAZORD, SHOGUN MEGAZORD) OR SOME OF THEIR KNOWN VILLAINS (LIPSYNCHER, SILVER HORNS, GOLDAR, LORD ZEDD). THE TITLE OFFERS 3 GAME MODES: STORY MODE (1-PLAYER ONLY), FIGHTING MODE (2-PLAYER) AND TRIAL MODE (A SURVIVAL MODE FOR 1-PLAYER ONLY).

DURING STORY MODE, THE GOAL IS TO DEFEAT ALL THE 4 ZORDS, THE 4 VILLAINS UP TO LORD ZEDD AND LAST, BUT NOT LEAST, IVAN OOZE. IN THIS MODE, YOU CAN OPT BY THE THUNDER MEGAZORD (FORMED BY THE 5 ORIGINAL RANGERS) OR BY THE MEGA TIGERZORD (FORMED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE WHITE RANGER). THE FIGHTING MODE IS AN TRADITIONAL 2-PLAYER HEAD-TO-HEAD COMBAT, WHERE YOU CAN CHOOSE ANY OF THE 4 ZORDS OR EVEN THE 4 VILLAINS. TRIAL MODE IS A ENDURANCE-LIKE OPTION, AND THE MAIN GOAL IS TO WIN AS MANY BATTLES AS POSSIBLE USING ONLY 1 HEALTH BAR (THAT WILL BE PARTIALLY REPLENISHED AFTER EACH BATTLE).

AS WELL AS MANY FIGHTING GAMES, YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A POWER BAR (HERE, IT FILLS AUTOMATICALLY): IF YOU EXECUTE A SUPER MOVE WHEN THIS BAR IS FLASHING, IT WILL BE CAUSE MORE DAMAGE, BESIDES INCREASING 1 LEVEL. ONCE YOU HAVING REACHED ITS MAXIMUM STATUS, IT'S POSSIBLE TO EXECUTE POWER-UP VERSIONS OF SPECIAL MOVES OR EVEN UNLEASH HIGH-DAMAGE BLOWS (SUPER MOVES).</desc>

THERE ARE SIX DIFFERENT LEVELS TO PLAY IN EACH WITH THEIR OWN STANDARD OBSTACLES AND ENEMIES, MID-LEVEL BOSSES AND OF COURSE END BOSSES THAT RANGE FROM MORDANT, LORD ZEDD TO IVAN OOZE HIMSELF.  THERE ARE NO WEAPONS THAT CAN BE USED, INSTEAD THE PLAYER MUST RELY ON KICKS AND PUNCHES TO DISPATCH ENEMIES AND PICK UP HEALTH ITEMS LEFT BEHIND.

ADDITIONALLY, THE YELLOW, BLACK, PINK RANGERS ARE EXTREMELY FAST AND CAN JUMP INTO HIGHER AREAS BUT ARE MORE WEAKER THAN BLUE, RED, WHITE RANGERS WHO ARE MUCH STRONGER, BUT LACK THE SPEED AND JUMPING ABILITIES OF THE OTHER RANGERS.  PLAYERS CAN REFILL THEIR HEALTH BY PICKING UP HEART ICONS AND POWER ICONS TO INCREASE THEIR MORPHING METER.  ONCE FILLED, THE MORPHING METER WILL INCREASE THE RANGERS POWER, ATTACK CAPABILITIES, SPEED AND JUMPING ABILITIES.</desc>

		<desc>QUINHENTOS ANOS ATRÁS, UM ANTIGO E RESPEITADO TORNEIO DE LUTA SHAOLIN, REALIZADO A CADA 50 ANOS, FOI CORROMPIDO POR UM VELHO E MALVADO FEITICEIRO CHAMADO SHANG TSUNG. SHANG FOI ACOMPANHADO PELO PRÍNCIPE GORO, UM GUERREIRO DA RAÇA SHOKAN (UM MEIO-HUMANO / MEIO DRAGÃO DE QUATRO BRAÇOS). SABENDO QUE SE DEZ TORNEIOS SEGUIDOS FOSSEM VENCIDOS PELO CAMPEÃO DO OUTWORLD, O EARTH REALM SERIA CONQUISTADO PELO MAL E CAIRIA NA ESCURIDÃO, SHANG ENTROU COM GORO NO TORNEIO E FEZ COM QUE ELE DERROTASSE O GRANDE KUNG LAO. GORO TEM REINADO COMO O INVICTO CAMPEÃO DE LUTA POR QUINHENTOS ANOS AGORA. CONFORME O ÚLTIMO TORNEIO SE APROXIMA, RAIDEN, DEUS DO TROVÃO E PROTETOR DO EARTH REALM, PROMETE UM PLANO PARA PESAR A BALANÇA EM FAVOR DOS HUMANOS. SETE LUTADORES ENTRAM NA ARENA NA MISTERIOSA ILHA DE SHANG TSUNG: O GUERREIRO SHAOLIN LIU KANG, A AGENTE DAS FORÇAS ESPECIAIS SONYA BLADE, O BANDIDO MERCENÁRIO KANO, O ATOR JOHNNY CAGE, O GUERREIRO LIN KUEI SUB-ZERO E SEU ADVERSÁRIO MORTO-VIVO SCORPION, E O PRÓPRIO RAIDEN.

MORTAL KOMBAT É UM  JOGO DE LUTA SIDE-SCROLLING. A LUTA É DEFINIDA COMO UM KOMBAT UM CONTRA UM, PERMITINDO QUE CADA JOGADOR REALIZE UMA VARIEDADE DE SOCOS, CHUTES E MOVIMENTOS ESPECIAIS PARA DERROTAR SEU OPONENTE. QUANDO O ADVERSÁRIO ENCARA SUA DERROTA NA SEGUNDA RODADA, O VENCEDOR PODE EXECUTAR UM MOVIMENTO DE FINALIZAÇÃO CHAMADO "FATALITY" NO PERDEDOR. O FATALITY É UM MOVIMENTO ÚNICO PARA CADA LUTADOR QUE MATA GRAFICAMENTE O PERDEDOR EM UM FINAL ENCHARCADO DE SANGUE.

MORTAL KOMBAT COMEÇOU SUA VIDA COMO UM TÍTULO DE ARCADE DE 2 JOGADORES. É NOTÁVEL POR SEU USO DE ATORES DIGITALIZADOS PARA REPRESENTAR OS LUTADORES DO JOGO, BEM COMO O USO DE QUANTIDADES ABUNDANTES DE SANGUE DURANTE O JOGO.</desc>

LIKE HER BOYFRIEND, MS. PAC-MAN ATTEMPTS TO CLEAR FOUR VARIOUS AND CHALLENGING MAZES FILLED WITH DOTS AND EVER-MOVING BOUNCING FRUIT  WHILE AVOIDING INKY, BLINKY, PINKY AND SUE, EACH WITH THEIR OWN PERSONALITIES AND TACTICS.  ONE TOUCH FROM ANY OF THESE GHOSTS MEANS A LOSS OF LIFE FOR MS. PAC-MAN.

MS. PAC-MAN CAN TURN THE TABLES ON HER PURSUERS BY EATING ONE OF THE FOUR ENERGIZERS LOCATED WITHIN THE MAZE. DURING THIS TIME, THE GHOSTS TURN BLUE, AND MS. PAC-MAN CAN EAT THEM FOR BONUS POINTS (RANGING FROM 200, 400, 800 AND 1600, PROGRESSIVELY). THE ENERGIZER POWER ONLY LASTS FOR A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME, AS THE GHOST'S EYES FLOAT BACK TO THEIR CENTER BOX, AND REGENERATE TO CHASE AFTER MS. PAC-MAN AGAIN.

SURVIVE A FEW ROUNDS OF GAMEPLAY, AND THE PLAYER WILL BE TREATED TO HUMOROUS INTERMISSIONS SHOWING THE GROWING ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAC-MAN AND MS. PAC-MAN, LEADING ALL THE WAY UP TO THE ARRIVAL OF "JUNIOR".</desc>

		<path>./NBA Jam - Tournament Edition (USA).zip</path>
		<name>NBA Jam : Tournament Edition</name>
		<desc>THIS GAME LETS YOU PLAY TWO-ON-TWO ARCADE BASKETBALL WITH PLAYERS FROM ALL THE NBA TEAMS. GAMEPLAY IS FAST AND ACTION-PACKED, WITH FEW RULES, NO FOULS, AND DELIBERATELY UNREALISTIC JAMMING. PLAYERS ARE RATED ON EIGHT ABILITY CATEGORIES, FROM STEALS AND BLOCKS, TO DUNKS AND 3-POINTERS.

UP TO FOUR HUMAN PLAYERS CAN TAKE PART, EACH ALWAYS CONTROLLING A SINGLE PLAYER FOR THEIR TEAM, AND AI FOR MISSING PLAYERS. THIS ALLOWS FOR FOUR PLAYERS TO FACE EACH OTHER IN TEAMS OF TWO, OR FOR TWO PLAYERS TO TEAM UP AGAINST A THIRD PLAYER WITH A CPU TEAM-MATE.

THE TOURNAMENT EDITION UPS EACH TEAM'S ROSTER TO THREE PLAYERS, AND ALLOWS FOR SUBSTITUTIONS BETWEEN QUARTERS. SHOVING PLAYERS NOW RESULTS IN INJURIES, WHICH LOWER A PLAYER'S STATS; ENCOURAGING YOU TO SUB THEM OUT AND LET THEM RECOVER. ASIDE FROM THE USUAL SECRET CHARACTERS AND CHEAT MODES, THE T.E. ALSO INCLUDES FOUR NEW ADDITIONS YOU CAN INDIVIDUALLY ENABLE FROM THE SPECIAL OPTIONS MENU:

1. "HOT SPOTS" ARE RANDOMIZED ZONES ON THE COURT THAT REWARD EXTRA POINTS (UP TO A 9-POINT SHOT!) FOR MAKING A BASKET WHILE STANDING WITHIN THEM.

POWERUP ICONS APPEAR RANDOMLY, AND CONVEY TEMPORARY ARCADE-LIKE BENEFITS WHEN PICKED UP. SOME EXAMPLES ARE INSTANT "ON-FIRE," ENHANCED 3-POINT ACCURACY, MONSTER DUNKS FROM ANYWHERE ON THE COURT, OR A BOMB THAT KNOCKS ALL OTHER PLAYERS TO THE GROUND.

"JUICE MODE" INCREASES THE SPEED OF THE GAME UP TO 4X.

"TOURNAMENT MODE" DISABLES ALL OTHER MODES, SPECIAL CHARACTERS, AND CHEATS, AND CHALLENGES YOU TO DEFEAT ALL THE NBA TEAMS TO UNLOCK EXTRA PLAYERS (2 EXTRA PLAYERS FOR ALMOST EVERY TEAM). WINNING TOURNAMENT MODE ALSO UNLOCKS A HIGHER CPU DIFFICULTY LEVEL.</desc>

THE PLAYER HAS THE OPTION TO DRIVE A SINGLE RACE (WHERE THE OPTION TO PRACTICE IS HIDDEN) OR GO FOR THE CROWN AGAINST 12 OTHER DRIVERS IN 15 TRACKS (WITH SOME VARIETY, NOT ONLY OVALS) ACROSS NORTH AMERICA, WITH THE SEASON OPENER IN QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA. IT IS POSSIBLE PLAY SOLO, WITH A FRIEND IN SPLIT SCREEN OR WITH SPLIT SCREEN AGAINST THE COMPUTER, AND IF MUSIC OR ENGINE SOUNDS ARE PLAYED IN THE RACE.
A KEY CHOICE IN THE GAME IS SELECTING BETWEEN ARCADE AND SIMULATION MODE - IN THE LATER, THE CAR CAN TAKE A LOT LESS DAMAGE BEFORE GIVING UP, FINE-TUNING MUST BE DONE BY THE DRIVER AND RULES ARE ENFORCED, UNDER THE RISK OF A DISQUALIFICATION.

GRAPHICALLY, THE GAME IS LESS STERILE THAN MOST DRIVING GAMES OF THE PLATFORM (AND IN 16-BIT CONSOLES, GENERALLY), THANKS TO THE INCLUSION OF SEVERAL POLYGONAL BUILDINGS SCATTERED AROUND THE CIRCUITS.</desc>

THE NHL LICENSE ENSURES THAT REAL TEAMS AND PLAYERS OF THE ERA ARE INCLUDED, WITH A FULL LEAGUE AND PLAYOFF SYSTEM. MANY GAME OPTIONS CAN BE TOGGLED - THE INFAMOUS FIGHTING IS OPTION, AS ARE THE PENALTIES AND OFFSIDES. THE CONTROL SYSTEM MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO EXECUTE ONE-TOUCH PASSES, AND SEVERAL SPECIAL TRICK MOVES TO QUICKLY ADVANCE THE BALL. AS A BONUS FEATURE, IT INCLUDED 'HOCKEY CARD' PROFILES OF EVERY PLAYER ON CD, AND INTERVIEWS WITH THE STARS OF THE GAME.</desc>

		<desc>NICKELODEON GUTS IS BASED OFF OF THE NICKELODEON TV SHOW IN THE LATE 90'S THAT IS BASICALLY AMERICAN GLADIATORS FOR KIDS.  THE EVENTS IN THE GAME ARE BASED OFF OF THE ACTUAL GAME SHOW EVENTS WITH THE MAIN GOAL BEING TO SCORE AS MANY POINTS AS POSSIBLE WHILE TRYING TO BEAT THE CLOCK.

IN ELASTIC SPORTS, THE PLAYER IS STRAPPED ONTO A LONG BUNGEE CORD AND IS BOUNCED AROUND.  THERE ARE THREE EVENTS: SLAM DUNK IS A BASKETBALL GAME, ATTACK IS LACROSSE AND SPIRAL WHERE THE OBJECTIVE IS TO THROW A FOOTBALL THROUGH A HANGING TIRE.

ACTION SPORTS IS AN OBSTACLE COURSE WHICH SOMEONE WOULD FIND AT A BOOT CAMP AND IS DIVIDED INTO TWO EVENTS:  BASIC TRAINING INVOLVES POLES, SWINGING ROPES AND PUNCHING BAGS AND TORNADO RUN WHICH ADDS WATER JETS AND MOVING PLATFORMS.  PLAYERS CAN ALSO PICK UP BONUS ITEMS THAT WILL ADD TIME OR REPLENISH HEALTH AND A CHANCE AT THE BONUS ROUND.

THE FINAL EVENT IS THE AGGRO CRAG WHICH IS A GIANT INDOOR MOUNTAIN THE PLAYER MUST CLIMB WHILE AVOIDING VARIOUS OBSTACLES SUCH AS CONFETTI CANNONS, MOVING PLATFORMS AND SMOKE VENTS.  THE GOAL OF THIS EVENT IS TO NAVIGATE THE MOUNTAIN AND ACTIVATE FIVE DIFFERENT SENSORS LOCATED ON THE MOUNTAIN BEFORE BEING ABLE TO ACTIVATE THE LAST ONE AT THE VERY TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN.

THERE IS ALSO AN OPTION FOR TWO FRIENDS TO COMPETE EITHER HEAD-TO-HEAD OR ALTERNATING DEPENDING UPON THE EVENT.  ELASTIC LETS THE PLAYERS COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER ON A SPLIT-SCREEN WHILE ACTION SPORTS AND THE AGGRO CRAG HAS TO BE PLAYED THROUGH ALTERNATING PLAY.</desc>

		<name>Nobunaga's Ambition</name>
		<desc>IN THE 16TH CENTURY, JAPAN'S SENGOKU ("WARRING STATES") PERIOD DIVIDED THE NATION INTO NUMEROUS FEUDAL STATES, EACH RULED BY A DAIMYO. THESE DAIMYOS WOULD OFTEN GO TO WAR WITH EACH OTHER. MANY DREAMT OF CONQUERING THE LAND, BECOMING THE SHOGUN AND RULING THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. ONE OF THOSE DAIMYOS WAS THE AMBITIOUS NOBUNAGA ODA, A MERCILESS RULER AND A RENOWNED STRATEGIST. PLAYERS TAKE ON THE ROLE OF NOBUNAGA ODA OR ONE OF MANY OTHER DAIMYOS TO TRY TO CONQUER JAPAN. 

NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION IS A TURN-BASED STRATEGY GAME WHICH CAN BE PLAYED IN DIFFERENT MODES. GAMEPLAY IS SIMILAR TO KOEI'S BETTER KNOWN ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS GAME. PLAYERS BEGIN BY SELECTING EITHER A 17 REGIONS SCENARIO OR A LARGER 50 SCENARIO. THEN, THE PLAYER MUST SELECT A DAIMYO, EACH OF WHICH IS RATED ATTRIBUTES IN SEVERAL CATEGORIES; AGE, HEALTH, AMBITION, LUCK, CHARM AND IQ. AS THE GAME PROGRESSES, THESE VALUES CHANGE DEPENDING ON EVENTS IN THE GAME. THE AGE VALUE REPRESENTS A TIME LIMIT OF SORTS, AS AN ELDERLY DAIMYO BECOMES INCREASINGLY LIKELY TO DIE OF OLD AGE OR SICKNESS.

DURING EACH OF TURN (ONE PER SEASON), PLAYERS CAN ISSUE ONE OF SEVERAL COMMANDS FROM A MENU. THEY INCLUDE: RECRUITING NEW SOLDIERS, TRAINING THE ARMY, BUYING  WEAPONS, INCREASING PEASANT MORALE, FORMING ALLIANCES OR HIRING NINJAS TO BRIBE &amp; ASSASSINATE. WHEN ONE PLAYER ATTACKS ANOTHER, THERE IS A WAR FOUGHT OVER THE DEFENDER'S REGION. BATTLES ARE FOUGHT IN AN OVERHEAD-VIEW HEX BATTLE MAP. EACH PLAYER TAKES TURN MOVING UNITS AND ISSUING ORDERS, WHICH INCLUDE ATTACK, MOVE, BRIBE AND SURRENDER. THE GOAL IS TO DEFEAT ALL OF THE ENEMY UNITS (OR FORCE THEM INTO SURRENDER). ARMY UNITS EACH HAVE A CERTAIN WEAKNESS AGAINST OTHER TYPES OF ENEMIES, AND ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY THE TERRAIN.</desc>

THE GAMEPLAY CONSISTS OF A COMBINATION OF ARCADE ELEMENTS AND FIRST PERSON VIEW MUCH LIKE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER AND DUNGEON MASTER.  ONE OF THE MORE REMARKABLE FEATURES IS IN THE FIRST PERSON MODE, RATHER THAN HAVING JUST 4 DIRECTS TO FACE AND FLICKING BETWEEN THEM THERE ARE 8 DIRECTIONS AND THE VIEW SCROLLS SMOOTHLY AS YOU TURN. THIS SMOOTH SCROLLING CONTINUES WHEN YOU MOVE FORWARD, GIVING THE GAME MORE OF A 3D FEEL.

THE ARCADE ELEMENTS CONSIST OF HORIZONTAL SCROLLING AREAS WHERE YOU FIGHT ENEMIES WITH YOUR BOW WHILE AVOIDING THEIR ATTACKS.  LATER YOU ENCOUNTER A SIMILAR TYPE OF GAMEPLAY THAT INVOLVES EXPLORING CASTLES AND ADDS 4 DIRECTIONAL MOVEMENT.</desc>

		<desc>OLYMPIC SUMMER GAMES IS THE 16-BIT OFFICIAL VIDEOGAME OF THE 1996 OLYMPIC GAMES HELD IN ATLANTA, THE THIRD AND THE LAST IOC OFFICIAL TITLE TO BE RELEASED ON THE CONSOLE. A TYPICAL BUTTON MASHER, INCLUDES 10 EVENTS (100M SPRINT, 110M HURDLES, POLE VAULT, LONG JUMP, TRIPLE JUMP, JAVELIN, HIGH JUMP, DISCUS, SKEET AND ARCHERY) AND 32 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD COMPETE IN CUSTOM OR FULL OLYMPICS, OR JUST PRACTICE. TWO PLAYERS CAN COMPETE HEAD TO HEAD IN THE SPRINTING EVENTS, AND A TOTAL OF EIGHT CAN PLAY IN THE SAME GAME. THREE DIFFICULTY LEVELS ALLOW COMPETITIVE EVENTS FOR BOTH ROOKIES TO VETERANS IN THE GENRE.

SPRINTING EVENTS ARE A SHORT AND STRAIGHT BUTTON MASHING FRENZY. 4 ATHLETES COMPETE SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE FIRST WINNER ADVANCING TO THE NEXT ROUND (TWO QUALIFIERS AND THEN THE MEDAL RUN). ONLY FAST FINGERS AND QUICK SHOTGUN REACTION CAN EARN WORLD RECORD TIMES. 

JUMPING EVENTS ARE A MIX OF SHORTER BUTTON MASHING BURSTS COMBINED WITH TIMELY PRESSED JUMPS. FROM THE STRAIGHT FORWARD HIGH AND LONG JUMP EVENTS (RUN AND THEN SET THE JUMP ANGLE) TO THE MORE ELABORATE TRIPLE JUMP (AS THE NAME SUGGESTS, THREE JUMPS MUST BE CAREFULLY MEASURED FOR WORLD CLASS RESULTS) AND THE COMPLEX POLE VAULT, WHERE A STRONG RUN MUST BE FOLLOWED BY A SHARP POLE FIXATION AND GOOD A RELEASE UPWARDS. BOTH LONG JUMP AND TRIPLE JUMP HAVE A FIRST ROUND COMPOSED BY THREE JUMPS, THE BETTER EIGHT PROGRESS INTO THE SECOND ROUND, WHERE THEY ARE GIVEN THREE MORE JUMPS. IN THE HIGH JUMP AND POLE VAULT THE COMPETITION CONTINUES UNTIL ALL ATHLETES MISS THREE CONSECUTIVE JUMPS.

THE THROWING EVENTS (DISCUS AND JAVELIN) WORK IN THE SAME FASHION AS THE JUMPING EVENTS, ALTHOUGH TRICKIER TO PULL, AS THE SETTING OF THE ANGLE MUST BE FOLLOWED BY A TIMELY RELEASE. EACH PLAYER IS ENTITLED TO THREE THROWS, THE TOP EIGHT ALLOWED THREE MORE ATTEMPTS.

FINALLY, THE SHOOTING EVENTS. ARCHERY IS A THREE-ROUND COMPETITION WHERE THE GOAL IS TO AMASS AS MANY POINTS AS POSSIBLE BY SHOOTING AT THE INNER RINGS OF THE TARGET. WITH SIX ARROWS PER ROUND, EACH SHOT MUST BE CALCULATED ACCORDING TO THE WIND, CHOOSING BETWEEN STEADY AIM AND LOWER TENSION (MUST BE AIMED UPWARDS AND COMPENSATING THE WIND) OR HIGHER TENSION BUT A JUMPY AIM (CAN BE AIMED DIRECTLY AT THE "GOLD" POINTS). SKEET IS A FIVE ROUND COMPETITION WHERE THE GOAL IS TO HIT FIVE CLAY PIGEONS BEFORE THEY DISAPPEAR OFF-SCREEN WITH TWO SLUGS FOR EACH.</desc>

THE GAME TAKES A DIFFERENT APPROACH TOWARD A SIMILAR END; INSTEAD OF MOVING THE BALL AROUND THE BOARD, YOU MOVE THE BOARD AROUND THE BALL.

THAT'S RIGHT; FROM THE GET-GO, GRAVITY PULLS EVER DOWN, DOWN, DOWN ON YOUR BALL TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SCREEN REGARDLESS OF BOARD ORIENTATION; THE TASK OF THE PLAYER IS TO ROTATE THE BOARD NOW CLOCKWISE, NOW COUNTER-CLOCKWISE, TO FURTHER A TIMELY AND UNOBSTRUCTED PATH BENEATH THE BALL IN ITS PROGRESS TOWARD EACH LEVEL'S GOAL BEFORE THE TIMER TICKS DOWN TO ZERO.  THE GAME MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN NAMED "INERTIA."  MANY OBSTACLES CAN BE AVOIDED, BUT SOME MUST BE ENGAGED HEAD-ON: A CERTAIN MOMENTUM, IF NOT TERMINAL VELOCITY, MUST BE ACHIEVED TO BREAK THROUGH CRUMBLING BRICK BARRIERS; OTHER OBSTACLES TOGGLE ON AND OFF LIKE TRAFFIC LIGHTS, DEMANDING NOT ONLY SPEED BUT TIMING.  SOME INFLUENCE THE BALL'S DIRECTION, AND IN ADDITION TO MERELY DELAYING THE BALL'S PROGRESS, TOUCHING SOME IMPEDIMENTS INCURS AN ADDITIONAL TIME PENALTY -- CONVERSELY, SOME BLOCKS BESTOW TIME BONUSES, IF YOU CAN AFFORD THE EVER-DIMINISHING TIME NEEDED TO TAKE THE SCENIC DETOUR AND COLLECT THEM.

IT MAY SEEM LIKE A TRANSPARENT ATTEMPT TO COBBLE TOGETHER A GAME AROUND A TECHNICAL DEMO OF THE SNES' MODE 7 ON-THE-FLY GRAPHICS-ROTATION CAPABILITIES, BUT TAITO ACTUALLY COOKED UP THIS KOOKY GAME INTERFACE TWO YEARS EARLIER FOR AN ARCADE RELEASE OF THIS GAME.

(NOW IF ONLY SOMEONE COULD EXPLAIN THE "CAMEL" PART - REFERENCING THE JAPANESE TITLE.)</desc>

		<desc>OPERATION THUNDERBOLT IS THE EXCITING SEQUEL TO OPERATION WOLF. AN AIRLINER IS HIJACKED BY TERRORISTS EN-ROUTE FROM PARIS TO BOSTON, WHO THREATEN TO KILL ALL HOSTAGES ON BOARD IF THEIR MATES AREN'T RELEASED FROM JAIL. INSTEAD OF REACHING ITS DESTINATION, THE AIRLINER MAKES A LANDING IN KALUBYA, AFRICA, AND ALL THE HOSTAGES ARE HIDDEN IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS. THE AUTHORITIES HAVE ASKED THE HERO FROM OPERATION WOLF TO RESCUE THE HOSTAGES, BUT ONLY THIS TIME, THE HERO BRINGS HIS FRIEND ALONG FOR THE RIDE.

THERE ARE EIGHT MISSIONS TO COMPLETE IN OPERATION THUNDERBOLT, AND EACH ONE HAS YOU SHOOTING DOWN SOLDIERS, CHOPPERS, AND TANKS. THE GAMEPLAY VARIES EVERY ONE OR TWO MISSIONS. IN SOME MISSIONS, YOU ARE DRIVING A JEEP OR CONTROLLING A BOAT, WHILE IN OTHERS, YOU ARE WALKING WHILE YOU'RE SHOOTING. YOU HAVE A LIMITED SUPPLY OF AMMO, AND A LIMITED SUPPLY OF ROCKET BOMBS, BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS STOCK UP BY SHOOTING DOWN CRATES FALLING FROM THE SKY, OR BY KILLING A CAT OR DOG THAT GET IN THE LINE OF FIRE. ALSO FROM CRATES, YOU CAN GET SPECIAL ITEMS LIKE BULLETPROOF VESTS, ROCKET BOMBS, AND DIFFERENT WEAPONS.

YOU ALSO HAVE A LIFE BAR TO WORRY ABOUT. IF YOU'RE SHOT AT BY SOLDIERS, OR IF ROCKET BOMBS OR GRENADES ARE THROWN AT YOU, YOU 'LL LOSE ENERGY, AND ONCE YOU'RE ENERGY IS DEPLETED,  YOU LOSE ONE OF YOUR THREE LIVES. YOU CAN LOSE A LOT OF ENERGY BY KILLING HOSTAGES ON PURPOSE,  AND YOU CAN'T EASILY AVOID KILLING THEM IF YOU DECIDE TO USE ROCKET BOMBS TO WIPE OUT ENEMIES. THE EIGHTH MISSION, THE MISSION THAT INVOLVES YOU FIGHTING TERRORISTS ON A PLANE,  PROVES TO BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE A WOMAN IN A BLUE DRESS STANDS UP AND GETS IN THE LINE OF FIRE, AND YOU HAVE TO VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO USE ROCKET BOMBS.

THERE ARE TWO ENDINGS TO THIS GAME, AND WHICH ENDING YOU CAN WATCH WILL DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF HOSTAGES YOU'VE SAVED, AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU SHOT THE PILOT INSTEAD OF THE MISSION EIGHT BOSS.</desc>

NOW HE MUST FIGHT FOR HIS LIFE, FIRST WITH HIS BARE HANDS, THEN WITH A GUN HE FINDS. BUT WHAT GIVES HIM COURAGE IS THAT HE IS NOT ALONE. ONE OF THE ALIENS, WHO TOGETHER WITH HIM ESCAPES FROM THE PRISON, HELPS HIM ON HIS DANGEROUS QUEST. FRIENDSHIP CAN OVERCOME ALL THE OBSTACLES.

OUT OF THIS WORLD IS AN ACTION ADVENTURE GAME, WHERE THE ADVENTURING ELEMENT IS CONCEALED BEHIND WHAT LOOKS LIKE A TYPICAL PLATFORM SHOOTER. THE GAMEPLAY IS BASED MAINLY ON PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PUZZLES. THERE IS NO ON-SCREEN INTERFACE, AND NO IN-GAME DIALOGUE. EACH ENEMY REQUIRES A DIFFERENT STRATEGY, AND OFTEN THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. TYPICALLY, ENEMIES WILL BE DEFEATED THROUGH THE USE OF A GUN YOU FIND NEAR THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME; THE GUN CAN BE USED TO CREATE A SHIELD FROM BEHIND WHICH YOU CAN SAFELY FIRE. 

THE GAME IS DIVIDED INTO LEVELS, EACH ONE OF WHICH CAN BE ACCESSED BY TYPING A CODE YOU LEARN AFTER HAVING COMPLETED THE LEVEL. IF YOU DIE (WHICH IS OFTEN) YOU RESTART THE LEVEL ANEW. THE GAME FEATURES VECTOR GRAPHICS AND ANIMATED CUT SCENES.</desc>

		<desc>MINDSCAPE DEVELOPED THIS GAME HOPING TO GET IT LICENSED AS AN OFFICIAL MAD MAX GAME, HOWEVER WARNER BROS NEVER MADE THIS HAPPEN. ANYWAY, THE GAME CLOSELY RESEMBLES "THE ROAD WARRIOR" (MAD MAX 2). YOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO DRIVE YOUR CAR THROUGH THE WASTELAND, TRYING TO SURVIVE MOTORCYCLE GANG MEMBERS' ATTACKS AND TO AVOID RUNNING OUT OF GAS.

THE GAMEPLAY IS A SPLIT OF TWO GENRES: RACING AND SIDE-SCROLLING. IN THE RACING PARTS YOU HAVE TO DESTROY ENEMIES LIKE MOTORCYCLE GANG MEMBERS, GYRO-COPTER CAPTAINS, RED TRUCKS, ETC. YOUR CAR HAS A MACHINE-GUN INSTALLED IN ITS FRONT, AND IF SOME GUY DRIVES ALONG SIDE OF YOU, A LITTLE WINDOW POPS UP, ALLOWING YOU TO SHOOT THEM WITH YOUR SHOTGUN.

ALONG THE ROAD THERE ARE SEVERAL TOWNS, AND EVERY TIME YOU PASS THROUGH ONE OF THEM, AN ALARM WILL WARN YOU. AS YOUR GAS RUN LOW, YOU HAVE TO STOP ON THESE TOWNS AND REFUEL YOUR RESERVES OF GAS AND AMMO. WHEN DOING SO, THE GAME TURNS TO A SIDE-SCROLLING PERSPECTIVE, AS YOU GET OUT OF YOUR CAR, DEALING WITH YOUR ENEMIES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBATS. IN THE CITIES YOU'LL ALSO FIND NEW EQUIPMENT TO YOUR CAR, SUCH AS MISSILE LAUNCHERS, NITRO, ETC.</desc>

		<desc>BASED ON NAMCO'S JAPANESE-ONLY ARCADE PUZZLER COSMO GANG THE PUZZLE, PAC-ATTACK IS SIMILAR TO MANY BLOCK-DROPPING PUZZLE GAMES FROM THE TIME, SUCH AS PUYO PUYO.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME IS TO PLACE GHOSTS AND THEN, AFTER THREE PIECES (WHICH CAN INCLUDE ONE OR TWO BLOCKS AS WELL), MAKE PAC-MAN EAT AS MANY GHOSTS AS POSSIBLE TO TRY AND CLEAR UP THE GAME AREA. PAC-MAN'S DIRECTIONS ARE CHOSEN AT RANDOM BETWEEN LEFT OR RIGHT, BUT AS HE GOES MOVING ON THE GAME AREA (AFTER YOU PLACE HIM, OF COURSE), IF HE BUMPS AGAINST A BLOCK OR A "WALL" ON THE GAME AREA, HE WILL CHANGE HIS DIRECTION. AS WITH MANY BLOCK-DROPPING PUZZLERS, IF A LINE OF BLOCKS AND/OR GHOSTS REACHES THE TOP, THE GAME ENDS. HOWEVER, BY FILLING UP A METER ON THE LEFT OF THE GAME AREA, A FAIRY MAY APPEAR THAT CAN CLEAR APPROXIMATELY 6 OR 7 LINES WITH GHOSTS, BUT IT ONLY CLEARS THE GHOSTS, ALTHOUGH THE BLOCKS THAT WERE ON TOP OF THEM WILL DROP.

ALSO, LIKE MANY PUZZLERS, IT CONTAINS A VERSUS MODE AGAINST ANOTHER HUMAN PLAYER. IT'S SIMILAR TO THE MANY VERSUS MODES OF PUZZLE GAMES: EAT PLENTY OF GHOSTS AND YOUR OPPONENT WILL RECIEVE MANY GHOSTS ON HIS AREA.

THE GAME ALSO INCLUDES A PUZZLE MODE. IT FEATURES 100 LEVELS, IN WHICH YOU HAVE TO EAT ALL GHOSTS WITH NO MORE THAN 4 PAC-MEN AT LEAST (THE NUMBER REDUCES IN CERTAIN LEVELS), AND, UNLIKE THE OTHER MODES, YOU CAN CHANGE PAC-MAN'S DIRECTION WITH THE PRESS OF A BUTTON.

ALL OF THE HANDHELD VERSIONS (INCLUDING THE ONE ON PAC-MAN COLLECTION) LACK THE VERSUS MODE.</desc>

THE GAME IS A RIGHT-TO-LEFT SCROLLING SHOOT-EM-UP. YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM 4 DIFFERENT FLYING CREATURES, WITH DIFFERENT WEAPONS. YOU MUST FINISH 7 STAGES, EACH HAVING A BOSS AT THE END. YOU MAY START AT EITHER ONE, BUT MUST COMPLETE EVERY LEVEL TO ADVANCE TO THE FINAL STAGE.</desc>

		<desc>EUROPEAN TOUR IS BEST THOUGHT OF AS A REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL GAME, RATHER THAN A SEQUEL AS SUCH. IT FEATURES 5 COURSES FROM ACROSS EUROPE, AND 60 TOP EUROPEAN PROS, RATHER THAN THE US-LEANED LINEUP OF THE ORIGINAL. THE GRAPHICS ARE MUCH MORE DETAILED AND COLORFUL, AS YOU'D EXPECT CONSIDERING THE INTERVENING YEARS OF ADVANCES IN PROGRAMMING SKILL.

THE CONTROL SYSTEM IS THE STANDARD THREE-CLICK METHOD USED IN MOST GOLF GAMES, BUT YOU CAN NOW DEFINE INTENDED DRAW/FADE LEVELS IN ADVANCE OF PLAYING THE SHOT, SO THAT A PERFECT AIM LEADS TO A MEASURED EFFECT, AND AN IMPERFECT ONE EXAGGERATING THE EFFECT.

AS WELL AS THE STROKE PLAY GAMES OF THE ORIGINAL (WHERE YOU COUNT THE TOTAL SCORE ACROSS THE WHOLE ROUND OF 18 HOLES, AND COMPARE THIS TO YOUR OPPONENT), THERE ARE ALSO MATCH PLAY (WHERE THE AIM IS TO WIN AS MANY INDIVIDUAL HOLES AS POSSIBLE) AND SKINS (THE SAME, BUT WITH MONEY) MODES AS WELL.</desc>

		<name>PGA Tour 96</name>
		<desc>PGA TOUR 96 WAS THE LAST OF THE SERIES RELEASED FOR SEGA'S 16-BIT CONSOLE, AND TECHNOLOGICALLY THE MOST ADVANCED ONE. INSTEAD OF OFFERING  SEVERAL GENERIC COURSES, THE THREE AVAILABLE (SPYGLASS HILL, SAWGRASS AND RIVER HIGHLANDS) ARE IN 3D, WITH HEIGHT DIFFERENCES VISIBLE (AS WELL AS THE LIMITED 3D ABILITIES OF THE CONSOLE ALLOW).

THE PLAYER CAN EITHER CHOSE TO PLAY AS ONE OF THE 10 PGA PROS (WHOSE SWINGS WERE DIGITIZED), OR GO PRO - THE GAME KEEPS TRACK OF STATISTICS (LONGEST DRIVE, DRIVING ACCURACY, BEST ROUND, ETC), A GAME (TOURNAMENT, STROKEPLAY, SKINS, MATCH AND SHOOTOUT), AS WELL AS A REPLAY.

GAMEPLAYWISE, PGA 96 USES THE TRIED-AND-PROVED TRIPLE CLICK SYSTEM - ONE TO START THE SWING, OTHER TO SET STRENGTH AND A FINAL ONE FOR ACCURACY. IT'S POSSIBLE TO FADE OR DRAW THE BALL (TO BEND THE TRAJECTORY), ADD BACKSPIN AND PITCH OR CHIP THE BALL (FOR SOME MEDIUM RANGE ATTEMPTS AT THE HOLE OR GO ABOVE A BUSH).THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL AFFECTS MOSTLY THE LENIENCY OF THE TRIPLE CLICK HIT AREAS - WHILE AT NOVICE IT IS POSSIBLE TO LET THE ACCURACY A BIT OFF-CENTER, IN PRO LEVELS THE BALL GOES WHERE YOUR SWING TOOK IT - NO EXCUSES TAKEN. HOWEVER, ONLY IN PRO IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THE LONGEST DRIVES, AS THE AMATEUR AND NOVICE LEVELS TAKE A FEW YARDS FROM THE TOTAL CAPACITY OF THE CLUB.</desc>

		<desc>YOU PLAY A GOD, GAMING AGAINST OTHER GODS IN A CELESTIAL GAME OF CONQUEST.  TO WIN, YOU MUST HELP YOUR CHOSEN PEOPLE TAKE OVER THE WORLD AND WIPE OUT THE VERMIN WHO WORSHIP THAT OTHER GOD.

EACH GOD STARTS OUT WITH A SINGLE HUMAN, DUMPED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE WILDERNESS.  SOMETIMES THERE IS INHABITABLE LAND IN SIGHT, SOMETIMES NOT.  TO GET WIN, YOU MUST CHANGE THE LANDSCAPE, CREATING FLAT LAND FOR YOUR FOLLOWERS TO BUILD ON.  THE MORE FOLLOWERS YOU HAVE YOU HAVE, THE MORE POWERFUL YOU WILL BE, SO TAKE CARE OF THEM. BUILD AS FAST AS YOU CAN, BECAUSE THE OTHER GOD IS DOING THE SAME.

WHEN YOU HAVE ENOUGH FOLLOWERS, YOU CAN MAKE THE LEADER OF YOUR PEOPLE INTO A HERO.  HE WILL THEN GO AROUND THE LAND YOU HAVE BUILT, LITERALLY TAKING STRENGTH FROM THE PEOPLE INTO HIMSELF, AND WORKING HIS WAY TOWARD THE ENEMY.  WHEN HE GETS THERE, HE WILL ENGAGE IN HOLY WARFARE UPON YOUR ENEMY'S PEOPLE.  HE WILL BURN; HE WILL KILL.  AND HE WON'T STOP UNTIL THEY'RE ALL DEAD... OR HE IS.

BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LET YOUR PEOPLE HAVE ALL THE FUN; THE GOD'S HAVE OTHER TOOLS AS WELL.  YOU CAN DROWN YOUR ENEMIES ONE AT A TIME WITH YOUR LAND LOWERING POWERS.  SUBMERGE THEIR TOWNS IN SWAMPS. RAISE A VOLCANO IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR BEST FARMLAND.  EVEN BETTER, YOU CAN FLOOD THE LAND AND DRAIN ALL THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T BUILD ON HIGH-GROUND. 

AND WHEN YOU WIN, YOU'LL HAVE 500 MORE WORLDS TO CONQUER.  A GOD'S PLAY IS JUST NEVER DONE.</desc>

APPARENTLY, YOUR FRIEND, DOGGIE, LIKES TO EAT COOKIES THAT HAS HIS PICTURE ON THEIR BOX, AND HE GOT HIMSELF SO CARRIED AWAY THAT HE LOST THE BALANCE, AND A BAG OF COOKIES FELL DEEP DOWN INTO AN ANT-HILL. NOW, YOU'RE GOIN' IN, IN A MISSION OF SOLVING PUZZLES, AND RETRIEVING THE COOKIES FOR YOUR FRIEND.

NOW, THIS ANT-HILL IS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM THE ONES YOU SAW, AND ESPECIALLY FROM THE ONE YOU LIVE IN. IT'S PATH IS FILLED UP WITH BOULDERS, AND ALL THE GATES, AND YOU MUST TRAVEL THE QUEST TO FIND THE COOKIES. AFTER EACH DIFFERENT PLACE INSIDE, YOU'LL FINS A SMALL BAG OF COOKIE, AND BRING IT BACK TO YOUR FRIEND DOGGIE.

THE MAIN QUEST CONSISTS OF YOU CARRYING YOUR-SIZE BOULDERS, AND PLACING THEM IN A WELL IMAGINED LINE, SO WHEN YOU PUSH THE EXACT ONE, ALL MUST FALL, AND THE ONE THAT MARKS THE END MUST FALL THE LAST, OR THE DOOR WILL STAY SHUT PERMANENTLY. BESIDE WE KNOW THAT ANTS ARE VERY EASY, AND CAN LIVE ALMOST EVERY FALL, YOU CANNOT PRACTICE THAT, SO IF YOU JUSP FROM A LITTLE BIT TOO HIGH POSITION, DON'T EXPECT MUCH, BUT TO RETRY THE LEVEL.

EVERY BLOCK, OR BOULDER IN A GAME HAS A DIFFERENT MARKINGS. LIKE FOR EXAMPLE, THE YELLOW ONES ARE BRICKS YOU CAN PUSH, AND THEY WILL JUST AS EASILY FALL, AND PUSH, OR NOT, THE BRICK IN FRONT OF IT. THE RED ONES WILL DO THE OPPOSITE, YOU CANNOT PUSH THEM, AND IF THE YELLOW, OR ANY OTHER BRICK HITS IT, IT'LL CONTINUE FALLING BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE. SOME BRICKS EXPLODE WHEN YOU PUSH THEM, OR OTHER BRICK HITS THEM, AND THAT WAY THEY LEAVE THE HOLE, SO YOUR BRICK CAN CONTINUE SPINING, OR YET AGAIN, NOT. SOME SPIN WITHOUT STOP, 'TIL THEY HIT SOME OTHER BRICK THAT CAN FALL, SOME REPLACES THE SPACES, LIKE BUILDING A BRIDGE ON THAT PLACE, SOME GO HIGH AND WHEN HIT THE TOP, THEY STICK TO IT, AND PUSH, OR NOT, THE BRICK IN FRONT OF THEM. ANYWAY, THAT'S THE GAME BASICS.

EACH LEVEL GIVES YOU THE NEW CODE/PASSWORD, SO YOU CAN CONTINUE FROM THE POSITION WHERE YOU ENDED EACH TIME YOU TYPE THAT CODE. PERSPECTIVE OF YOUR ANT IS LIKE IN ANY OTHER PLATFORM GAME, AND YOU CONTROL IT WITH ARROW KEYS, OR JOYSTICK. BUT BEWARE, THE TIME IS CLICKING, SO YOU'LL HAVE TO SOLVE EACH LEVEL IN A HURRY.</desc>

		<name>Radical Psycho Machine Racing</name>
		<desc>RPM RACING WAS PRECEDED BY RAREWARE'S R.C. PRO-AM IN 1988 AND ELECTRONIC ART'S RACING DESTRUCTION SET IN 1985, WITH THE LATTER BEING THE LARGER INFLUENCE. IT IS A PRECURSOR TO ROCK 'N ROLL RACING, WHICH WAS DONE BY THE SAME DEVELOPER.

COMBAT, OBSTACLES, AND TRACTION ON THE NON-FLAT TRACKS PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE. THERE ARE 3 VEHICLE TYPES TO CHOOSE FROM THAT PERFORM DIFFERENTLY ON PAVEMENT, DIRT, ICE, FLAT OR BUMPY TRACKS. CARS CAN BE ARMED WITH OIL, NITRO, AND MINES. ADDITIONALLY, THERE ARE 3 LEVELS OF TIRES, ENGINES, SHOCKS, AND ARMOR.

THERE ARE FULL RACE SEASON, SINGLE RACE, AND CUSTOM TRACK MODES. IN 1 PLAYER GAMES, THE 2ND PLAYER IS REPLACED WITH ONE OF 8 AI OPPONENTS WHO ARE EACH ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR OWN VEHICLE.

IN SEASON MODE, EACH TRACK HAS AN ENTRANCE FEE AND CASH PRIZE FOR PLACING 1ST; OFTEN LESSER CASH PRIZES FOR LESSER PLACEMENTS ARE ALSO AWARDED. FOR AN ADDITIONAL FEE, RACERS CAN OPT TO MOVE TO A HIGHER RACING CLASS (LEVELS) WHERE FEES AND PRIZES ARE BIGGER. EACH CLASS HAS ITS OWN SET OF TRACKS THAT THE PLAYER MAY CHOOSE FROM. NO TRACK IS MANDATORY OR UNAVAILABLE WITHIN A CLASS. THE PLAYER ALSO HAS THE OPTION OF GOING BACK TO A LOWER CLASS FOR FREE, WHICH MAY BECOME NECESSARY IF FUNDS ARE EATEN UP BE FEES WITHOUT WINNING PRIZES. HOWEVER, GOING UP ALWAYS INCURS A FEE, EVEN IF THE PLAYER HAS BEEN THERE BEFORE.

CUSTOM TRACK DESIGNING IS NOT INTUITIVE BUT FAIRLY EASY TO LEARN. PLAYERS CAN SET THE TRACK'S LAPS, GRAVITY, AND STARTING LINE TYPE. EACH TRACK SECTION CAN BE PAVEMENT, DIRT, OR ICE. TRACK SECTIONS ARE LAID OUT LIKE PUZZLE PIECES ON A 2D NON-ISOMETRIC GRID (PIPE-MANIA STYLE). SECTIONS INCLUDE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL STRAIGHTS, FOUR STANDARD 90° TURNS, EIGHT T-SECTIONS FOR DIVERGING AND CONVERGING MULTIPLE PATHS IN ANY DIRECTION, AND A CRISS-CROSS. EITHER A HORIZONTAL OR VERTICAL SPECIAL STRAIGHT SECTION IS USED AS THE STARTING GRID. THE STARTING GRID CAN BE ORIENTED FORWARD, REVERSED, FACE-OFF WITH PLAYER 1 FORWARD, OR FACE-OFF WITH PLAYER 1 REVERSED. 7 POINTS ARE USED TO ADJUST THE 6 SLOPES IN STRAIGHT SECTIONS TO 5 DIFFERENT HEIGHTS. SLOPES CAN BE FLAT (0:1), INCLINED (1:1), OR STEEP (2:1). NON-STRAIGHT SECTIONS CAN ONLY BE ADJUSTED FOR HEIGHT FOR THE ENTIRE SECTION AT ONCE. AN ISOMETRIC VIEW OF INDIVIDUAL SECTIONS IS PROVIDED TO HELP TO ORIENT THE SECTION'S DESIGN TO THE ADJACENT SECTIONS. IF THE EDGE OF A SECTION DOES NOT MATCH THE HEIGHT OF THE ADJACENT SECTION(S), THE PLAYER IS WARNED IMMEDIATELY BUT MAY PROCEED WITHOUT CORRECTING THE ERROR IMMEDIATELY. BUT SUCH ERROR MUST BE ELIMINATED BEFORE THE TRACK CAN BE SAVED. ALSO REQUIRED FOR A TRACK TO BE SAVED IS NO DEAD ENDS, AND A STARTING GRID SECTION. THE TRACK VERIFICATION IS SURPRISINGLY LIBERAL, EVEN ALLOWING DIVERGING AND CONVERGING PATHS THAT ARE AGAINST THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC (LIKE TURNING AROUND AND GOING THE WRONG WAY UP A FREEWAY MERGING LANE). THE AI OPPONENTS ARE GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO DISCERN THE FASTEST OR SHORTEST ROUTE AND CAN EVEN BE DIVERTED INTO A PATH WITH NO NATURAL EXIT, OR WITH VERY CLEVER PATH DESIGNS, VALID LAP PATHS CAN BE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FOR PLAYER 1, PLAYER 2, AND AI PLAYERS; WHICH CAN LEAD TO INTERESTING TRAFFIC PATTERNS.</desc>

		<desc>EVERYBODY HAS REMEMBERED WAKING UP EARLY ON THE WEEKEND TO WATCH SATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS. BUT WOULD WOULD HAPPEN IF THE CARTOONS WERE INTERACTIVE? WELL, YOU MIGHT END UP WITH SOMETHING LIKE DEATH VALLEY RALLY. THE OBJECT IS PRETTY SIMPLE: RACE THE ROAD RUNNER THROUGH EACH LEVEL AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN WHILE COLLECTING DIFFERENT COLORED FLAGS, WHICH ARE WORTH DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF POINTS. WHEN YOU REACH THE ENDING, IF YOU'RE FAST ENOUGH, YOU'LL ALSO GET A TIME BONUS, BUT IF YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH, YOU'LL GET A FLAG BONUS. SOME OF THE FLAGS ARE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO FIND, AND THE FACT THAT YOU WON'T USUALLY BE ABLE TO FIND THEM, WILL CHALLENGE (OR AT LEAST FRUSTRATE) MOST GAMERS. YOU CAN RUN, TURBO RUN (BY STOCKING UP ON BIRD SEED), PECK, AND JUMP IN THIS WILD ADVENTURE, AS YOU TRY TO CATCH THE ESCAPE THE EVER-WITTY WILE E. COYOTE AND HIS ASSORTED ACME CONTRAPTIONS.</desc>

		<desc>YOUR NAME IS KEVIN CODNER  RESCUE MARINER EXTRAORDINAIRE, ANSWERING THE DISTRESS CALL OF A SINKING CRUISE LINER, THE SS LUCIFER. YOU SET OFF IN YOUR LITTLE SUBMARINE AND BOARD THE SHIP WHERE A HORDE OF PASSENGERS DESPERATELY NEED YOUR KEEN OVERSIGHT AND "SHIPSMARTS".

IN 60 LEVELS YOU HAVE TO RESCUE AS MANY PASSENGERS (DUBBED THE DIM PASSENGERS) AS POSSIBLE. AT THE BEGINNING THE PASSENGERS FALL THROUGH A TUBE IN THE LEVEL. SIMILAR TO LEMMINGS YOU HAVE TO FIND A WAY FOR THE PASSENGERS TO THE EXIT OF THE LEVEL. IN ORDER TO DO SO, YOU MUST BLAST HINDRANCES SUCH CARGO BOXES AND BULKHEADS WITH BOMBS OR, WHEN NO BOMBS ARE LEFT, REPOSITION THE BOXES WITH A CRANE. THERE ARE ALSO CONVEYOR BELTS IN THE LEVELS. IF THE BELT MOVES IN THE WRONG WAY, THE PASSENGERS EITHER CAN'T USE IT OR MAY EVEN BE TRANSPORTED TO THEIR DOOMS, BEING DROPPED OFF INTO WATER, FIRE OR STEAM JETS. YOU CAN USUALLY CHOOSE THE DIRECTION OF THE BELTS BY PULLING A LEVER.

THERE ARE SEVERAL TYPES OF SCENARIOS THAT KEVIN CODNER (YOU) ARE FACED WITH THROUGHOUT THE GAME. OF COURSE THE PUZZLES GET PROGRESSIVELY MORE DIFFICULT, INVOLVING THINGS LIKE PATCHING UP CRACKED PIPES TO STOP A LETHAL JET OF STEAM FROM COOKING THE DISTRESSED PASSENGERS. YOU CAN BLAST AWAY OBSTACLES AND STACK CRATES IN CREATIVE MANNERS. FOR INSTANCE, YOU CAN HAVE THEM FALL ONTO EACH OTHER TO FORM A BRIDGE ACROSS A GAP OR TO PROVIDE SHIELDING FROM FIRE. THIS IS USUALLY DONE BY HOISTING THEM ONTO CONVEYOR BELTS USING A CRANE.

EACH LEVEL HAS A CERTAIN "SAVE LIMIT", MEANING YOU HAVE TO SAVE AT LEAST A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PASSENGERS. THIS AGAIN IS AKIN A BIT TOWARDS LEMMINGS, AND LOTS OF LEVELS HAVE A BUILT-IN TIME LIMIT, REPRESENTED BE WATER POURING INTO THE COMPARTMENT, RISING OMINOUSLY. WHEN THE WATER RISES HIGH ENOUGH, THE PASSENGERS WILL GET CARRIED ALONG WITH IT, AND THEY CAN ONLY SWIM FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE GETTING EXHAUSTED AND DROWNING, SO YOU'D BETTER BE ON TIME WITH SOME ASSISTANCE.

AT THE END OF EACH LEVEL YOU RECEIVE A PASSWORD (AGAIN, LEMMINGS-STYLE) SO THAT YOU MAY PICK UP YOUR GAME FROM THE CURRENT LEVEL WITHOUT HAVING TO PROGRESS THROUGH THEM ALL FROM THE GET-GO.</desc>

		<path>./Civilization (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Sid Meier's Civilization</name>
		<desc>CIVILIZATION HAS THE WIDEST SCOPE OF ANY STRATEGY GAME OF ITS TIME. YOU ARE A LEADER OF A NATION. YOU BEGIN IN THE STONE AGE, AND COMPLETE THE GAME IN THE XXITH CENTURY (UNLESS YOUR CIVILIZATION GETS DESTROYED EARLIER). YOUR EVENTUAL GOAL IS TO BECOME THE DOMINANT CIVILIZATION IN THE WORLD, EITHER BY WIPING OUT EVERYBODY ELSE, OR BEING THE FIRST TO GET A SPACE SHIP TO ALPHA CENTAURI.

AS THE NATION'S LEADER, YOU HAVE MANY RESPONSIBILITIES. YOU HAVE TO BUILD CITIES, AND THEN MICROMANAGE THEM, CONSTRUCTING VARIOUS BUILDINGS. MOST OF PEOPLE IN YOUR CITIES WILL BE WORKING ON THE NEIGHBOURING LANDS TO GET FOOD (WITHOUT IT, YOUR CITY WON'T SURVIVE OR GROW), PRODUCTION (USED TO BUILD MILITARY UNITS AND BUILDINGS) AND TRADE (WHICH CAN BE EXCHANGED FOR MONEY, SCIENCE (SEE BELOW) OR LUXURIES THAT MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY. YOU DECIDE HOW MUCH TRADE YOU WANT TO INVEST INTO EACH OF THESE AREAS.) YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PEOPLE ARE IN A GOOD MOOD; IF THEY GET TOO UNHAPPY, THE CITY WILL COLLAPSE INTO DISORDER, AND WON'T PRODUCE ANYTHING UNTIL YOU FIX THE SITUATION. 

IF YOU'RE AMBITIOUS, YOU CAN BUILD WONDERS OF THE WORLD - EPIC CONSTRUCTIONS, SUCH AS THE PYRAMIDS OR THE HOOVER DAM. EACH WONDER IS AN UNIQUE THING, AND ONLY ONE OF EACH CAN EXIST IN THE WORLD. THEY GIVE YOU A LOT OF BENEFITS IF YOU COMPLETE THEM, BUT THEY TAKE A LONG TIME TO BUILD, AND MANY OF THEM WILL EVENTUALLY STOP WORKING. 

THERE ARE OTHER NATIONS IN THE WORLD, AND THERE ARE ALSO BARBARIANS, SO YOU'LL HAVE TO INVEST INTO THE MILITARY TO PROTECT YOURSELF AND TO ATTACK. SURE, YOU CAN SIGN PEACE TREATIES WITH OTHER NATIONS, AND EVEN EXCHANGE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE WITH THEM (ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES THEY'LL DEMAND TRIBUTE FROM YOU), BUT EVENTUALLY YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO FIGHT. YOU CONTROL EACH OF YOUR MILITARY UNITS ON THE WORLD MAP, ATTACKING YOUR OPPONENTS' UNITS AND CITIES (POSSIBLY TAKING OVER THEM). 

NOT ALL UNITS ARE FOR COMBAT THOUGH. SETTLERS ARE USED TO BUILD CITIES, CREATE ROADS (FOR EASIER TRAVEL OF YOUR UNITS) AND IMPROVE THE LAND AROUND CITIES, INCREASING PRODUCTION. DIPLOMATS CAN BE SENT TO FOREIGN CITIES TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE OTHER NATIONS OR CREATE EMBASSIES, BUT THEY CAN ALSO BRIBE ENEMY UNITS TO JOIN YOU AND CONDUCT ESPIONAGE AND SABOTAGE IN THE ENEMIES' CITIES. CARAVANS CAN BE SENT TO FARAWAY CITIES TO INCREASE TRADE IN THEIR HOME CITY, AND THEY CAN ALSO HELP IN BUILDING WONDERS OF THE WORLD. 

SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE GAME. THE MORE SCIENCE YOUR CITIES PRODUCE, THE FASTER YOU RESEARCH NEW TECHNOLOGIES. INITIALLY, YOU'LL BE FINDING OUT ABOUT THE WONDERS OF ALPHABET OR BRONZE WORKING, BUT LATE IN THE GAME YOU'LL BE RESEARCHING COMPUTERS AND ROBOTICS. MOST TECHNOLOGIES GIVE YOU SOME NEW UNITS, BUILDINGS AND OTHER THINGS, ALTHOUGH SOME HAVE MORE INTERESTING EFFECTS - FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER INVENTING THE AUTOMOBILE, YOU'LL FIND OUT THAT YOUR CITIZENS STARTED PRODUCING POLLUTION. POLLUTION IS A BAD THING; IF THERE'S TOO MUCH OF IT, GLOBAL WARMING MAY OCCUR. 

HOW YOUR CITIES PROSPER DEPENDS PARTIALLY ON THE TYPE OF GOVERNMENT THAT YOUR NATION HAS. INITIALLY YOU'RE LIVING IN DESPOTISM, BUT THIS CAN STUNT GROWTH OF YOUR CIVILIZATION, SO IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO SWITCH TO SOMETHING ELSE - MONARCHY, REPUBLIC, DEMOCRACY OR COMMUNISM.</desc>

SUCCESSFUL MAYORING WILL CAUSE THE SMALL VILLAGE TO GROW INTO A TOWN, THEN A CITY AND FINALLY A METROPOLIS. AS THE CITY'S SIZE GROWS SO DO IT'S NEEDS. COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS MAY SUDDENLY FIND THAT THEY NEED AN AIRPORT TO EXPAND TRADE, OR HOUSING MAY FIND ITSELF CHANGING RAPIDLY AS VAST AMOUNTS OF PEOPLE COME AND LEAVE.

THE GAME ALSO INCLUDES 8 PRE-DEFINED TIME-LIMITED SCENARIOS, WITH SPECIFIC CHALLENGES AND TARGETS. THE ENVIRONMENT VARIES IN EACH GAME (ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE THE TERRAIN EDITOR ADD ON), AND THIS SHOULD AFFECT YOUR CHOICES.</desc>

		<desc>THE PIRATE SKÜLJAGGER AND HIS CREW HOLD THE ISLAND OF WESTICA HOSTAGE. FORCING THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE TO BE HIS SLAVES, SKÜLJAGGER RULES UNOPPOSED WITH AN IRON FIST. A BRAVE SAILOR NAMED STORM 
JAXON DECIDES TO REBEL AND STEAL SKÜLJAGGER'S MAGICAL SWORD. NOW HE MUST FIGHT FOR HIS LIFE AND ULTIMATELY TO FREE THE WESTICAN PEOPLE.

SKÜLJAGGER: REVOLT OF THE WESTICANS IS A SIDESCROLLING PLATFORM GAME. PLAYERS SELECT BETWEEN A 1 PLAYER GAME, AN ALTERNATING TURN 2 PLAYER GAME OR BUBBLEGUM PRACTICE. THE PLAYER CONTROLS STORM JAXON WHO IS ABLE TO RUN LEFT AND RIGHT, JUMP AND SWING SKÜLJAGGER'S MAGIC SWORD. STORM MUST REACH THE END OF EACH LEVEL BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT OR RISK LOSING A LIFE. UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, TOUCHING AN ENEMY OR PROJECTILE WILL CAUSE HIM TO DIE, THOUGH THE SWORD IS OFTEN ABLE TO DESTROY PROJECTILES. BY COLLECTING RED JEWELS, STORM IS ABLE TO BOTH AUGMENT THE SWORD WITH A PROJECTILE ATTACK AND BE PROTECTED FROM ONE ENEMY ATTACK. GREEN JEWELS WILL ALSO PROTECT FROM ONE ENEMY ATTACK, HOWEVER COLLECTING 25 OF THEM WILL GRANT AN EXTRA LIFE. BLUE JEWELS ADD ADDITIONAL TIME FOR STORM TO COMPLETE EACH LEVEL. FINDING A MASK WILL MAKE STORM INVULNERABLE FOR A SHORT TIME. THESE POWER-UPS ARE EITHER FLOATING IN THE AIR OF EACH LEVEL OR HIDDEN AWAY IN CHESTS, BOXES, ROCKS AND COCONUTS. HOWEVER THESE ITEMS WHICH MAY HIDE ITEMS CAN ALSO BE PICKED UP AND THROWN AT ENEMIES.

IN ADDITION TO THE POWER-UPS LISTED ABOVE, FRUITY BUBBLEGUM CAN ALSO BE FOUND. ONLY ONE BUBBLE GUM FLAVOR CAN BE CARRIED AT A TIME AND IT WILL BE HELD UNTIL THE PLAYER ACTIVATES IT. GRAPE BUBBLEGUM ENCASES STORM IN A GIANT INVULNERABLE BUBBLE THAT CAN BOUNCE HIGHER THAN JUMPING ALONE. CHERRY BUBBLEGUM WILL REQUIRE THE PLAYER TO INFLATE MANUALLY, BUT WILL ALLOW STORM TO FLY. BEWARE AS OVER INFLATING THE BUBBLE WILL POP IT. WATERMELON BUBBLEGUM WILL TURN STORM INTO A PROJECTILE THAT DAMAGES ANYTHING ON THE SCREEN, ALSO GATHERING ITEMS. ORANGE BUBBLEGUM WILL LET STORM SPIT OUT PELLETS AT ENEMIES WHICH WILL DESTROY THEM. BUBBLEGUM POWER-UPS CAN BE TESTED IN THE SPECIAL BUBBLEGUM PRACTICE OPTION OF THE MENU.</desc>

		<name>SOS</name>
		<desc>THE DATE IS TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 13TH, 1921.  IT'S A STORMY NIGHT, AND THE LUXURY OCEAN LINER "LADY CRITHANIA" IS ABOUT TO BE CAPSIZED BY AN ENORMOUS WAVE.  MANY OF ITS CREW AND ITS 2300 PASSENGERS WILL BE KILLED OUTRIGHT IN THE INITIAL OVERTURNING; IN THE TRANSFIGURED CATASTROPHIC SHIP ENVIRONMENT, MOST OF THE REMAINDER WILL BE UNABLE TO LOCATE, REACH AND SECURE A SAFE EXIT FROM THE SINKING SHIP BEFORE IT FLOODS ENTIRELY.  WILL YOU?

INSPIRED BY PAUL GALLICO'S 1969 NOVEL THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, THIS GAME PUTS THE PLAYER IN THE SHOES OF ONE OF FOUR DENIZENS OF THE FATED VESSEL: CAPRIS WISHER, ARCHITECT; REDWIN GARDENER, COUNSELOR; LUKE HAINES, SAILOR; OR JEFFREY HOWELL, DOCTOR.  EACH OF THESE GENTLEMEN POSSESS CERTAIN EXCLUSIVE SKILLS AND DISTINCT BACKSTORIES AND MOTIVATIONS -- A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY TOWARD WINNING THE GAME WILL VARY GREATLY DEPENDING ON WHICH CHARACTER YOU INITIALLY SELECT TO PLAY.  AND JUST HOW IS THE GAME WON?

HERE'S A HINT: DON'T BE ON THE SHIP WHEN IT GOES DOWN FOR THE LAST TIME.  ACCOMPLISHING THIS DEMANDS MASTERY OF A NEW SKILL HITHERTO UNTAPPED BY ITS PLATFORM-GAME SPIRITUAL PREDECESSORS PRINCE OF PERSIA AND FLASHBACK: EXPLORING AND NAVIGATING THE SHIP IN BOTH AN UPRIGHT AND AN UPSIDE-DOWN POSITION, AS WELL AS MANY OF THE GRADIATED PERMUTATIONS BETWEEN -- THANKS TO DIZZYING MODE 7 ABUSE, THE GAME ENVIRONMENT WILL TIP, TILT AND SKEW AT PREDICTABLE (AND PREDICTABLY INCONVENIENT) INTERVALS, GRANTING ACCESS TO SOME HITHERTO UNREACHABLE AREAS (THOSE DOORS AT FLOOR LEVEL ARE OF LITTLE USE WHEN YOU'RE ON THE CEILING!) WHILE DENYING ACCESS TO OTHER PORTIONS OF THE SHIP YOU PERHAPS INTENDED TO GO BACK THROUGH.  YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO RECOGNIZE WHERE YOU CAN AND CAN'T -- YET -- REACH, AND MAKE A NOTE TO REVISIT WHEN THE PENDULUM SWINGS THE OTHER WAY.

YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT OUT ON YOUR OWN.  A SUCCESSFUL EVACUATION IS GOING TO REQUIRE THE ASSISTANCE OF OTHER SURVIVORS.  SUPPOSING YOU CAN FIND ( -- AND REACH!) THEM, YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE TO SAFELY LEAD THEM PAST OBSTACLES AND HAZARDS (AS THE SHIP FLIP-FLOPS ON ITS WAY TO DAVY JONES' LOCKER)... AND AS WITH ALL NPCS, THEY'RE SLOWER AND LESS AGILE THAN YOU, NECESSITATING PLOTTING OUT THE SIMPLEST, SAFEST COURSE POSSIBLE (... GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.)  WHICH OF THE ENDINGS YOU CONCLUDE WITH WILL BE DETERMINED BY WHO YOU RESCUE AND HOW MANY OF THEM THERE ARE -- BUT I'M SURE YOU'LL HAVE YOUR HANDS FULL THE FIRST FEW DOZEN PLAY-THROUGHS JUST STAYING ALIVE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET TO WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE GOING.

DID I MENTION THERE'S A TIME LIMIT OF ONE MEASLY HOUR?  FOR ONCE, IT'S YOUR FRIEND; SINCE YOUR INJURY IN THIS DANGEROUS AND UNPREDICTABLE ENVIRONMENT IS SO FREQUENT AND, INDEED, INEVITABLE, DEATH HAS BEEN REPLACED BY A DEDUCTION OF 5 MINUTES FROM THE TIME REMAINING -- BUT NO MATTER HOW SAFE AND DRY A HIDEY-HOLE YOU MANAGE TO FIND, WHEN THE COUNTDOWN REACHES ZERO, IT'S GAME OVER.

HOPE YOU PACKED A TOWEL!</desc>

		<name>Soul Blazer</name>
		<desc>YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED BY THE MASTER TO RESTORE LIFE TO THE FRIEL EMPIRE.  THE RULER, KING MAGRIDD, STRUCK A DEAL WITH THE EVIL DEATHTOLL - IN EXCHANGE FOR THE SOUL OF ONE LIVING BEING, DEATHTOLL WILL GIVE HIM A PIECE OF GOLD.  MAGRIDD'S GREED GOT THE BETTER OF HIM, AND, THINKING OF THE MILLIONS OF SOULS OF EVERY LIVING CREATURE AROUND THE WORLD, READILY AGREED TO THE DEAL.  BUT MAGRIDD HIMSELF HAS SINCE DISAPPEARED, AND THE THE LAND IS NOW DEVOID OF LIFE - INSTEAD ONLY FILLED WITH DEATHTOLL'S MONSTROUS MINIONS.  WILL YOU BE ABLE TO SAVE FRIEL'S SUBJECTS FROM THEIR HORRIBLE FATE?

SOUL BLAZER IS AN ACTION RPG IN THE TOP-DOWN STYLE OF THE LEGEND OF ZELDA.  LIKE ZELDA, BATTLES ARE NOT TURN-BASED - THE PLAYER DIRECTLY ATTACKS ENEMIES AND DODGES THEM.  AS THEY PROGRESS, THEY ALSO UNLOCK SPECIAL ITEMS WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO COMPLETE TASKS FOR CHARACTERS OR ACCESS SPECIAL AREAS (SUCH AS THE DREAM ROD, WHICH TRANSPORTS YOU INTO SOMEONE'S - OR SOMETHING'S - DREAM).  UNLIKE ZELDA, THE GAME HAS AN EXPERIENCE METER, AND THE PLAYER LEVELS UP AND BECOMES STRONGER AS THEY DEFEAT ENEMIES.  THE GAME'S UNIQUE HOOK IS THAT THERE ARE "MONSTER LAIRS" SPREAD ALL OVER THE LAND OF FRIEL.  WHEN THEY DESTROY ALL THE ENEMIES IN A LAIR, THEY DON'T COME BACK, AND WHEN THEY STEP ON THE EMPTY LAIR, IT RESTORES PART OF THE GAME WORLD, BRINGING BACK ANYTHING FROM PLANTS, TO ANIMALS, TO PEOPLE, TO BUILDINGS AND MORE.  EACH RESTORED SOUL HELPS IN SOME WAY - FOR EXAMPLE, THE PLAYER CAN CLIMB REGROWN IVY TO REACH NEW AREAS, REUNITE FAMILIES BY BRINGING BACK HUSBAND AND WIFE, REBUILD CITIES BY RESTORING ARCHITECTS, AND TALK TO CHARACTERS TO COMPLETE EVEN MORE QUESTS.

THE PLAYER'S MAIN GOAL IS TO FIND SIX STONES, WHICH ALLOW THEM TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE WORLD OF EVIL, WHERE DEATHTOLL RESIDES.  THESE STONES ARE GUARDED BY KEY CHARACTERS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD, USUALLY THE RULERS, WHO REQUIRE THE PLAYER TO DEFEAT A BOSS CHARACTER TO RESCUE THEM.  WHILE MOST OF THE GAME ALLOWS THEM TO PROGRESS IN A LINEAR FASHION, THERE ARE CERTAIN SOULS THAT CAN ONLY BE RESTORED BY KILLING MONSTERS THAT CAN'T BE HARMED WITH THEIR EARLIER WEAPONS.  THE PLAYER WILL NEED TO FIND SPECIAL WEAPONRY AND THEN BACKTRACK TO PREVIOUS AREAS TO RESCUE THESE SOULS.  IT'S ALSO ADVISABLE TO REVISIT PREVIOUS LOCATIONS, AS CERTAIN CHARACTERS MAY HAVE NEW SIDEQUESTS TO COMPLETE WHICH CAN REWARD THEM WITH NEW ITEMS TO MAKE THEM EVEN STRONGER.</desc>

WHILE FOLLOWING THE SAME STORY AS THE LASERDISC CONVERSIONS, THE SNES VERSION OF SPACE ACE OBVIOUSLY LACKS THE LONG VIDEO SEQUENCES OF THE ORIGINAL, AND ALSO FEATURES DIFFERENT GAMEPLAY. 

INSTEAD OF ONLY PUSHING THE RIGHT BUTTON AT THE RIGHT MOMENT, THE PLAYER HAS COMPLETE CONTROL OVER DEXTER. MOST OF THE TIME, HE WILL BE BUSY JUMPING OVER CHASMS AND DODGING ALIEN ATTACKS, BUT OCCASIONALLY, AN 'ENERGIZE'-SYMBOL WILL APPEAR WHICH, BY PRESSING THE CORRECT BUTTON IN TIME, WILL TEMPORARILY TRANSFORM DEXTER INTO HIS STRONGER ALTER EGO AND ENABLE HIM TO SHOOT AT HIS ENEMIES.

ONCE HE BOARDS HIS SPACE SHIP, DEXTER HAS TO FIND HIS WAY OUT OF A LABYRINTHINE SEEN FROM A TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE, DESTROYING OBSTACLES WITH THE SHIP'S LASER AND AVOIDING COLLISIONS.

IN ORDER TO RETAIN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE ORIGINAL, THE SNES VERSION FEATURES A LARGE NUMBER OF (SHORT) DEATH ANIMATIONS AND THE PLATFORMER LEVELS ALWAYS FOLLOW THE EXACT SAME SEQUENCE, WHICH RESULTS IN A TRIAL&amp;ERROR-STYLE GAMEPLAY SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE ORIGINAL.</desc>

WHILE ON HIS WAY THROUGH THE FOREST HE SEE'S A WITCH IN THE SKY AND OUT OF NOWHERE BRICKS BEGIN TO MAKE A TOWER AROUND THE AREA SPANKY IS IN.

		<name>Sparkster</name>
		<desc>SPARKSTER IS A 2D SIDE-SCROLLING PLATFORMER STARRING THE EPONYMOUS HERO WHO PREVIOUSLY APPEARED IN ROCKET KNIGHT ADVENTURES. IT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE CONTEMPORARY GENESIS TITLE SPARKSTER, AS IT DOES NOT CONTINUE THE STORY FROM THE FIRST GAME AND HAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LEVELS, ENEMIES AND GAMEPLAY MECHANICS. IN THAT WAY IT CAN BE CONSIDERED A SPIN-OFF IN THE SERIES. THE INTRODUCTION MERELY SHOWS HOW AN ELDERLY MAN CAPTURES A GIRL AND TAKES HER INTO HIS AIRSHIP. AT THAT POINT SPARKSTER APPEARS AND HE DECIDES TO CHASE THEM.

SPARKSTER IS A RODENT CARRYING A ROCKET PACK ON HIS BACK. HE CAN MOVE AROUND, DUCK, JUMP AND HANG FROM BRANCHES OR RAILS. HIS REGULAR ATTACK IS A SWORD SLASH THAT SENDS OUT A CIRCULAR PROJECTILE. THROUGH THE L AND R BUTTONS HE CAN DASH LEFT AND RIGHT IN A CIRCLE OF FIRE. KEEPING THE ATTACK BUTTON PRESSED POWERS UP A ROCKET METER. WHEN FULL, DIFFERENT TYPES OR ACTIONS CAN BE PERFORMED: DASHING LEFT, RIGHT OR UP TO COVER A LARGE DISTANCE, RICOCHETING OFF WALLS IN A DIAGONAL MOTION, OR A STATIONARY ATTACK.

THE GAME CONSISTS OF NINE LEVELS OF WHICH THE LAST TWO CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED ON HIGHER DIFFICULTY LEVELS. SPARKSTER COLLECTS DIAMONDS FOR POINTS, DEFEATS ALL TYPES OF ROBOT ENEMIES AND COLLECTS APPLES TO RESTORE HIS HEART METER NEAR THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. MOST OF THE GAME CONSISTS OF REGULAR PLATFORMING GAMEPLAY, WITH A FEW DIVERSIONS WHERE SPARKSTER RIDES A ROBOT BIRD, OR IS SHOWN FROM A TOP-DOWN VIEW FLYING IN THE AIR LIKE A VERTICALLY-SCROLLING SHOOTER. ALL LEVELS HAVE A LEVEL BOSS ALONG WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF MID-LEVEL BOSSES. THE GAME SUPPORTS A PASSWORD SYSTEM.</desc>

		<path>./Spectre (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Spectre</name>
		<desc>SPECTRE IS A 3D SHOOTER WHERE THE PLAYER DRIVES A LITTLE RED CAR/TANK AND BLASTS AWAY ENEMIES.  THE GAMEPLAY IS SIMILAR TO BATTLEZONE, AND OBVIOUSLY INSPIRED BY IT.

THERE IS A SELECTION OF THREE TANKS, EACH WITH THREE VALUES (SPEED; ARMOR; AND FIREPOWER) BALANCED OUT TO MATCH ITS NAME: TOUGH GUY IS HEAVY ON ARMOR, BUT SLOW AND NOT VERY POWERFUL; SPEEDY IS FAST, BUT LOW ARMOR; AND BALANCED COMBINES BOTH STRENGTHS, BUT DECREASED. A FOURTH TANK ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO DESIGN A CUSTOM VARIANT.

EVERY LEVEL CONSISTS OF A LARGE PLANE FILLED WITH ENEMY TANKS, SEVERAL PSYCHEDELIC WALLS WITH ODD IMAGES THAT OFTEN FLICKER OR WARP RESEMBLING AN ACID TRIP, AND TACKY 3D MODELS LIKE WINDMILLS.  THE OBJECT OF EACH LEVEL IS TO EITHER DESTROY ALL THE ENEMY TANKS IN THE LEVEL, OR TO COLLECT ALL THE FLAGS. EVERY LEVEL HAS A CERTAIN THEME TO IT, ANYTHING FROM PLAIN GREEN TO A COLORFUL BLINKING EYE OR IMAGES OF SAND DUNES ARE TO BE FOUND ON THE WALLS, WINDMILLS AND FLAGS THROUGHOUT THE LEVEL.

WITH EVERY PASSING LEVEL, ENEMY TANKS GROW SMARTER AND THEIR RATES OF FIRE INCREASES.  ALSO IN LATER LEVELS, NEW, SMARTER, MORE POWERFUL ENEMY TANKS JOIN THE SKIRMISH. THE PLAYER HAS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF AMMO, BUT DRIVING OVER AMMO DEPOSITS REPLENISHES A SMALL AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION, AS WELL AS DRIVING OVER SHIELD DEPOSITS GRANTS ADDITIONAL SHIELDS. THE THREE DIFFERENT VIEWS (FIRST, THIRD, AND TOP-DOWN) ALLOW THE PLAYER TO INCORPORATE ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES INTO THE BATTLES.

THE GAME BOASTS HAVING SUPPOSEDLY AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF LEVELS, THOUGH ANYTHING AFTER LEVEL 80 IS ALMOST INSTANT DEATH.  A HIGH SCORE TABLE IS ALSO INCLUDED.

AN ADDITIONAL NOTE-WORTHY FEATURE OF THIS GAME IS THE MULTI-PLAYER MODE. UP TO EIGHT PLAYERS ARE SUPPORTED OVER IPX, OR NETBIOS (OR TWO VIA MODEM OR SERIAL PORT). THE NETWORK OPTION OFFERS THREE CYBERSPACE SCENARIOS: ARENA - FREE-FOR-ALL BATTLES, GET ONE POINT FOR EACH OPPONENT DESTROYED.
FLAG RALLY - A MATCH POINT GIVEN FOR COLLECTING SIX FLAGS, DESTROY SOMEONE TO GET ANY FLAGS BEING CARRIED.
BASE RAID - AKIN TO "CAPTURE THE FLAG".  TWO TEAMS, TWO BASES; GET MATCH POINT FOR DESTROYING OPPONENT BASE.
THE CD-ROM MANUAL INCLUDES A "CYBERPUNK STORY", TO GIVE BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE GAME WHICH CONSISTED OF A CYBERJOCK NAMED HART WHO LIVED FOR THE BATTLES IN THE ARENA.</desc>

		<desc>THE ROMULANS REQUEST PERMISSION TO ENTER THE NEUTRAL ZONE IN ORDER TO SEARCH FOR A TEAM OF THEIR RESEARCHERS THAT THEY CLAIM HAS GONE MISSING. THE USS ENTERPRISE IS SENT TO MONITOR THEIR ACTIVITIES AND FIND OUT THEIR REAL MOTIVES.

GAMEPLAY IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS: COMMANDING THE ENTERPRISE FROM THE BRIDGE, CONTROLLING AN AWAY TEAM ON A PLANETARY MISSION AND COMBAT WITH OTHER SHIPS.

FROM THE BRIDGE YOU CAN CONTROL ALL OF THE SHIPS MAIN FUNCTIONS. CONN: SET COURSE TO A DIFFERENT PLANET OR SECTOR. COMMUNICATION:  COMMUNICATE: WITH OTHER SHIPS. SENSORS: RECEIVE INFORMATION ON YOUR SURROUNDINGS OR PLANETS YOU ARE ORBITING. COMPUTER: ACCESS A DATABASE THAT CONTAINS LOTS OF INFORMATION ON PLANETS, RACES, TECHNOLOGY, YOUR CREW ETC. ENGINEERING: IF THE ENTERPRISE GOT DAMAGED DURING COMBAT, YOU CAN USE THIS COMMAND TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES TO THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SHIP THAT NEED TO BE REPAIRED. BRIEFING ROOM: RECEIVE ORDERS AND INFORMATION ON YOUR CURRENT MISSION. TACTICAL STATION: ENGAGE IN COMBAT. TRANSPORTER: ASSEMBLE AN AWAY TEAM AND BEAM IT DOWN TO A PLANET (WHICH IS ONLY POSSIBLE IF YOUR CURRENT MISSION REQUIRES IT).

BEFORE STARTING AN AWAY MISSION, YOU HAVE TO ASSEMBLE A TEAM OF FOUR CREW MEMBERS THAT DIFFER IN STRENGTH AND IN TACTICAL AND TECHNICAL ABILITY. SOME CREW MEMBERS ALSO HAVE SPECIAL ABILITIES, DR. CRUSHER CAN HEAL OTHER CREW MEMBERS, GEORDI AND DATA CAN SEE IN THE DARK AND DATA CAN SURVIVE WITHOUT AIR. AWAY MISSIONS ARE SHOWN FROM A TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE AND YOU CAN CONTROL EACH TEAM MEMBER INDIVIDUALLY OR ORDER DIFFERENT MEMBERS TO FOLLOW YOUR CURRENTLY SELECTED CHARACTER AROUND. MOST AWAY MISSIONS ARE A MIXTURE OF SIMPLE (REAL TIME) COMBAT AND PUZZLE SOLVING THAT USUALLY CONSISTS GETTING HINTS FROM TRICORDER READINGS AND FINDING OBJECTS THAT HAVE TO BE USED IN THE CORRECT WAY.

SHIP BATTLES ARE ALSO SEEN FROM A TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE AND LET YOU ATTACK ENEMY SHIPS WITH PHASERS AND PHOTON TORPEDOES, WHILE KEEPING AN EYE OR YOUR SHIELDS AND TRYING TO DODGE YOU ENEMY'S TORPEDOES. IF YOUR SHIP TOO HEAVILY DAMAGED YOU CAN SURRENDER AND HOPE THAT YOUR ENEMY SPARES YOU.

WHILE THE SNES AND GENESIS VERSIONS ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME GAMES, THERE ARE SOME NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCES. THE GENESIS VERSION PLAYS CONSIDERABLY FASTER DURING SHIP BATTLES AND ON AWAY MISSIONS AS WELL AS ON THE BRIDGE (MEANING IT TAKES MUCH LESS TIME TO REPAIR THE SHIP). THERE ARE MANY GRAPHICAL DIFFERENCES AND THE MAP LAYOUT FOR AWAY MISSIONS IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE SNES VERSION AS WELL.</desc>

THE GAME FEATURES FOUR MODES OF PLAY: 
SPEED TRAX IS BASICALLY AN ARCADE MODE WHERE THE PLAYER HAS TO QUALIFY FOR EACH UPCOMING RACE BY REACHING CHECKPOINTS WHILE COLLECTING ITEMS TO RESTORE HIS DAMAGE- AND BOOST-BAR. IT IS DIVIDED INTO A NOVICE-, EXPERT-, AND MASTER CLASS, WITH EACH CLASS FEATURING FOUR UNIQUE TRACKS.
IN STUNT TRAX THE PLAYER HAS TO COMPLETE COURSES FILLED WITH OBSTACLES WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME LIMIT WHILE TRYING TO COLLECT AS MANY STARS AS POSSIBLE.
BATTLE TRAX IS A TWO PLAYER MODE TAKING PLACE ON SPECIAL TRACKS WITHOUT ANY CPU-CONTROLLED OPPONENTS.

		<name>Super Baseball 2020</name>
		<desc>IN THE YEAR 2020, BASEBALL FINALLY EVOLVED. THERE IS NO LONGER CONVENTIONAL PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL IN 2020. BASEBALL DESIGNED BY THE SUPER BASEBALL ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN VERY POPULAR AND IS THE BEST SPORT.

HOWEVER, THE TRUTH IS THAT THE ASSOCIATION HAS USED A COLOSSAL SUM OF MONEY TO PROMOTE SUPER BASEBALL AS SHOW BUSINESS. THEY HAVE MANIPULATED EACH PLAYER'S ABILITY USING THE CONTROL COMPUTER TO SECRETLY DECIDE VICTORY OR DEFEAT IN EVERY GAME. THE PLAYERS WHO KNEW THIS REMOVED THE CONNECTING PARTS OF THE COMPUTER TO PLAY THEIR OWN GAME OF BASEBALL. FINALLY, A FAIR GAME IS GOING TO BE PLAYED AT CYBER EGG STADIUM.

IN 2020 SUPER BASEBALL IS A FAST-PACED GAME WITH NEW RULES, WHERE YOU CAN SELECT 1 OF 12 INDIVIDUAL MEN, WOMEN, OR ROBOT PLAYERS. DURING PLAY, YOU CAN MAKE YOUR TEAM STRONGER WITH PRIZES EARNED FROM AMAZING CATCHES.</desc>

		<name>Super Chase H.Q.</name>
		<desc>SUPER CHASE H.Q. IS AN ENHANCED SEQUEL TO CHASE H.Q. AS USUAL, YOU MUST DRIVE YOUR WAY TOWARDS A CRIMINAL'S VEHICLE, WHICH IS KNOWN TO BE INVOLVED IN SOME CRIME, WHILE AVOIDING PASSING CARS TO GAIN POINTS. YOUR CAR ALSO COMES EQUIPPED WITH THREE TURBOS, WHICH CAN BE USEFUL IF YOU ARE WAY BEHIND THE VEHICLE.

BUT THIS TIME, CARS AREN'T JUST THE ONLY THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. YOU WILL ALSO ENCOUNTER BIKES THAT SHOOT OR THROW FIREBOMBS AT YOU, AS WELL AS CARS THAT GO THE WRONG WAY. (IF YOU CRASH INTO ONE OF THESE, YOU'LL BE SENT FLYING THROUGH THE AIR.) NOT TO MENTION OTHER OBSTACLES SUCH AS BARRICADES.

FURTHERMORE, AS WELL AS THE CRIMINAL'S DAMAGE INDICATOR, YOU ALSO HAVE YOUR OWN. WHEN YOU FINALLY CATCH UP WITH EACH CRIMINAL,  THEY ARE LIKELY TO SHOOT AT YOU IF YOU GET TOO CLOSE TO THEIR VEHICLE, BUT YOU MAY ENCOUNTER CRIMINALS WHO HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF ATTACKING YOU. THE FOURTH CRIMINAL, FOR EXAMPLE, LAUNCHES A MISSILE AT YOU IF YOU ARE FURTHER BEHIND HIM. ONCE YOU ARE SHOT AT AND HIT, YOUR INDICATOR DECREASES FOR EVERY TIME YOU ARE HIT, BUT THIS RULE DOES NOT APPLY WHEN YOU'RE HIT BY PASSING CARS. WHEN YOUR INDICATOR IS EMPTY OR WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF TIME, THE GAME ENDS.

WHEN YOU COMPLETE EACH ROUND, A STATISTICS SCREEN WILL APPEAR, AND YOU ARE AWARDED POINTS BASED ON THE TIME REMAINING, HOW MUCH DAMAGE YOU'VE DONE, AND THE NUMBER OF NITROS THAT ARE USED. ONE OF THE OPTIONS ALLOW YOU TO DISPLAY THE GAME'S SPEEDOMETER IN EITHER MPH OR KM/H. THE GAME ALSO HAS A STORYLINE, WHICH CAN BE VIEWED IN BETWEEN ROUNDS.</desc>

DEPENDING ON THE SKILL LEVEL OR SCENARIO YOU CAN ALSO CONSTRUCT FACTORIES TO PRODUCE ADDITIONAL UNITS.</desc>

THIS GAME STARTS OFF LIKE ALMOST EVERY OTHER MARIO GAME, WITH BOWSER KIDNAPPING PRINCESS TOADSTOOL. HOWEVER, WHEN MARIO GOES TO BOWSER'S KEEP TO SAVE HER, A GIANT SWORD MADE BY THE EVIL SMITHY CRASHES INTO THE CASTLE AND SENDS MARIO, THE PRINCESS, AND BOWSER FLYING TO SEPARATE PARTS OF THE WORLD.

THE GAME PLAYS MUCH LIKE A TRADITIONAL RPG: MARIO AND THE MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY GAIN EXPERIENCE POINTS BY DEFEATING ENEMIES. THESE EXPERIENCE POINTS CAN INCREASE THE TEAM'S MAXIMUM NUMBER OF HIT POINTS AND FLOWER POINTS (MAGIC POINTS). THE BATTLES ARE ALSO TURN-BASED, BUT THIS TIME THERE ARE TIMED ATTACKS AND DEFENSES. TIMED ATTACKS ALLOW YOU TO INFLICT MORE HARM THAN NORMAL TO AN ENEMY. TIMED DEFENSES, ON THE OTHER HAND, ALLOW AN ENEMY TO INFLICT LESS HARM THAN NORMAL. YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO HAVE THREE OUT OF FIVE TEAM MEMBERS ON YOUR PARTY AT A TIME. MARIO IS ALWAYS IN YOUR PARTY, REGARDLESS. YOUR TEAM MEMBERS CAN ALSO PURCHASE MORE WEAPONS AND ABILITIES, ALONG WITH BETTER ARMOR.</desc>

O PLANETA ZEBES É UM MUNDO ABERTO QUE SAMUS ATRAVESSA DE UM LADO PARA O OUTRO. ESTE MUNDO É DIVIDIDO EM SALAS SEPARADAS POR PORTAS QUE DEVEM ATINGIDAS POR UM PROJÉTIL PARA SEREM ABERTAS. O TIRO TAMBÉM É USADO PARA ABRIR PASSAGENS SECRETAS, ALGUMAS DAS QUAIS CONTÊM ÓTIMOS BÔNUS, MAS A MAIORIA DELAS É NECESSÁRIA PARA PROSSEGUIR NO JOGO.NNNNHÁ MUITOS ITENS A SEREM ENCONTRADOS NO CAMINHO, E CADA NOVO ITEM GERALMENTE GARANTE ACESSO À ÁREAS ANTES INACESSÍVEIS PARA SAMUS. OS ITENS INCLUEM ARMAS (COMO MÍSSEIS, SUPER MÍSSEIS OU UPGRADES PARA A ARMA LASER PADRÃO DE SAMUS), TANQUES DE ENERGIA QUE AUMENTAM A SAÚDE MÁXIMA DE SAMUS E OUTROS DISPOSITIVOS (COMO UM GANCHO QUE PERMITE QUE SAMUS SE PRENDA AO TETO).NNNNEXISTEM VÁRIOS INIMIGOS - A FAUNA ALIENÍGENA - ESPREITANDO AO REDOR DO PLANETA ZEBES. TODOS OS INIMIGOS REAPARECEM DEPOIS DE ENTRAR NOVAMENTE EM UMA SALA, EMBORA OS RECURSOS CRESCENTES DE SAMUS SIGNIFIQUEM QUE ELES SE TORNAM MAIS FÁCEIS DE SEREM DERROTADOS À MEDIDA QUE O JOGADOR PROGRIDE. DEPOIS DE MATÁ-LOS, OS INIMIGOS NORMALMENTE DEIXAM PARA TRÁS UM POUCO DE SAÚDE OU MUNIÇÃO.</desc>

		<desc>YOUNG MORRIS ROLPH HAS BEEN TRAPPED IN LIMBO DUE TO A MALFUNCTION ON DR KRANKENPOT'S NEW TELEPORT MACHINE (HOW COME CHARACTERS WITH GERMAN-SOUNDING NAMES IN COMPUTER GAMES AND FILMS ARE ALWAYS EVIL OR STUPID? EVEN DARTH VADER SOUNDS GERMAN.). NOW HE'S BEEN SPLIT INTO HIS 4 COMPONENT PARTS, REPRESENTED BY LIQUID, GAS, A HARD BALL AND A BOUNCY BALL, AND HE MUST GET THROUGH 24 LEVELS (36 ON THE SPECIAL A1200 VERSION - MIRRORING THE GAME'S PLOT-LINE OF IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY CAUSING MORE PROBLEMS FOR MORRIS) TO RETRIEVE THE PARTS OF THE MACHINE SO IT CAN BE REBUILT TO BRING HIM BACK TO LIFE.

THE GAMEPLAY IS VAGUELY INFLUENCED BY LEMMINGS, AS THE LEVELS ARE POPULATED BY LOTS OF POINTS WHICH CAN'T BE CROSSED IN ALL FORMS - WALLS, FIRES, GAPS, THORNBUSHES AND SUCHLIKE. YOU GET A SET NUMBER OF TRANSFORMATIONS ON EACH LEVEL, ALTHOUGH EXTRA ONES CAN BE PICKED UP AT TIMES, AND THERE ARE HEATERS AND FREEZERS DOTTED AROUND WHICH CAUSE TRANSFORMATIONS IN SOME STATES. ALL THIS IS DONE AGAINST A TIME LIMIT. LIKE LEMMINGS 2, YOU CAN TAKE ON THE NEXT LEVEL IN EACH OF THE WORLDS AT ANY TIME, SO YOU HAVE TO BE STUCK 4 TIMES BEFORE YOU CAN'T PROGRESS.</desc>

		<desc>ONE DAY A SPACESHIP CAME DOWN FROM THE HEAVENS AND INTO THE SKIES OF CHINALAND. IT BEGAN BROADCASTING AN IMAGE OF PEACE. SOON EMPEROR CHIN WAS HOLDING A PEACE CONFERENCE WITH THE SPACE SHIP'S LEADER, RUB-A-DOC. RUB-A-DOC VISITED WITH SOME OF THE OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD BEFORE DEPARTING TO THE HEAVENS AND LEAVING THE WORLD. ALL SEEMED PEACEFUL HOWEVER THERE SEEMS TO BE TROUBLE STARTING UP, STRANGE MONSTERS HAVE BEEN SEEN THROUGHOUT CHINALAND. COULD THE INCREASE IN MONSTERS BE SOMEHOW RELATED TO THE RECENT VISIT FROM RUB-A-DOC? THE NINJA MASTERS OF MOUNT EDIN, JACK AND RYU ARE SENT TO INVESTIGATE...

SUPER NINJA BOY IS AN ACTION RPG FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS. IN A TWO PLAYER GAME, EACH PLAYER CONTROLS EITHER JACK OR RYU. IN A ONE PLAYER GAME, ONLY JACK APPEARS.A SECOND PLAYER MAY JOIN AT ANY TIME BY VISITING A CONVENIENCE STORE.

AS MENTIONED, THIS GAME IS AN RPG AND CONTAINS FAMILIAR RPG ELEMENTS SUCH AS EQUIPPING DIFFERING KINDS OF WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT AND GAINING LEVELS. THE NINJA BOYS ARE TREATED AS A SINGLE ENTITY AND SO THESE STATISTICS ARE SHARED BETWEEN JACK AND RYU WITH EQUAL VALUES. BATTLES WITH THE ENEMY, EITHER THROUGH RANDOM ENCOUNTERS OR VISIBLE ON THE MAP IS WHERE THE ACTION STARTS. THE CHARACTERS ENTER A SIDE-SCROLLING 'BATTLE MODE' WHERE THEY MAY JUMP, FIGHT, USE THEIR SPECIAL TECHNIQUES, ITEMS AND SPELLS... AS WELL AS ACTIVATE VARIOUS 'BONUSES' ON THE BATTLEFIELD BY BREAKING OPEN THE BONUS BOXES. A BATTLE IS OVER AND EXPERIENCE POINTS AWARDED WHEN A PRE-DETERMINED NUMBER OF ENEMIES ARE DEFEATED OR THE NINJA BOYS ARE DEFEATED.

WHEN BOSSES ARE ENCOUNTERED, THE GAMEPLAY CHANGES TO A TURN-BASED SYSTEM. EACH TURN, COMMANDS ARE GIVEN TO JACK &amp; RYU, WHICH INCLUDE USAGE OF SPECIAL ITEMS AND SKILLS ACCUIRED DURING THE GAME, WHO THEN PERFORM ACTIONS BASED ON THOSE COMMANDS. THE ENEMY'S TURN TAKES PLACE THE SAME WAY. THE BATTLE ENDS WHEN ONE SIDE OF THE CONFLICT RUNS OUT OF HITPOINTS.</desc>

THE GAME HAS THREE DIFFERENT TOURNAMENTS, THE MEXICO 250, ENSENADA 500 AND BAJA 1000. INSTEAD OF HAVING TO DRIVE MANY CONSECUTIVE ROUNDS ON A SMALL CIRCUIT THE CIRCUITS ARE BIG AND MORE AKIN TO RALLY RACING WITH A FINISH AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION THAN THE START. THE GAME IS STILL HELD WITH MANY OPPONENTS AS WELL AS NON PARTICIPATING TRAFFIC AND WILDLIFE THAT CAN HINDER THE PLAYER OR BE RUTHLESSLY RUN OVER. ALONG THE BUMPY OFF-ROAD TRACKS THE PLAYER CAN COLLECT BAGS OF MONEY, JUST LIKE IN ITS PREDECESSOR. MONEY CAN BE SPEND ON IMPROVEMENTS OF VARIOUS OF THE CAR'S PARTS, SUCH AS: BRAKES, TIRES, SHOCKS, LIGHTS, ENGINE AND NITROS.</desc>

THE EMPHASIS OF SUPER SCOPE 6'S GAMEPLAY IS ON FIRST PERSON SHOOTING, USING THE REQUIRED SUPER SCOPE ACCESSORY TO AIM. IT FEATURES A TOTAL OF SIX GAME MODES, CATEGORIZED AS EITHER BLASTRIS OR LASERBLAZER.

BLASTRIS MODE FEATURES A VARIETY OF UNRELATED GAMES.

1. BLASTRIS A IS A FALLING BLOCK GAME BASED ON TETRIS AND PLAYS VERY SIMILAR. BLOCKS APPEAR ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND MOVE TOWARDS THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN, WHERE THEY WILL FIT INTO PLAY. THE GOAL IS TO HAVE THE BLOCKS ON ANY COLUMN LINE UP AND DESTROY THEMSELVES. EACH LEVEL REQUIRES FIVE OF THESE TO HAPPEN. UNLIKE TETRIS, THE PLAYER CANNOT MOVE OR EVEN ROTATE BLOCKS. INSTEAD EACH SECTION OF THE BLOCK CAN BE DESTROYED BY SHOOTING IT. HIGHER DIFFICULTY LEVELS INCREASE THE SPEED OF GAMEPLAY
2. BLASTRIS B IS A FALLING BLOCK GAME BASED ON COLUMNS AND PUYO PUYO. ON EACH SCREEN ARE A NUMBER OF "JELLY BLOCKS" WHICH MUST BE DESTROYED TO COMPLETE THE STAGE. NEW BLOCKS APPEAR AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN AND MOVE TOWARDS THE BOTTOM WHERE THEY FIT INTO PLAY. BLOCKS CAN BE DESTROYED BY LINING UP A ROW OF 4 BLOCKS OF THE SAME COLOUR. THE PLAYER IS UNABLE TO MOVE THE FALLING BLOCKS BUT MAY CYCLE THEIR COLOUR BY SHOOTING AT THEM.
3. MOLE PATROL IS COMBINATION OF WHACK-A-MOLE AND A SHOOTING GALLERY. A NUMBER OF MOLES APPEAR ON THE SCREEN WITH A FLAG INDICATING THE AMOUNT THAT NEED TO BE DESTROYED THAT LEVEL, BEFORE JUMPING INTO A PIPE. FROM THERE THE MOLES WILL CLIMB OUT OF ANY ONE OF 12 HOLES ON THE SCREEN AND THE PLAYER MUST SHOOT THEM AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. ALONG WITH REGULAR MOLES ARE PINK MOLES THAT WILL TEMPORARILY SPEED UP GAMEPLAY, MAKING SHOTS MORE DIFFICULT.

LAZERBLAZER MODE FEATURE A GROUP OF GAMES SET IN A MILITARY ATMOSPHERE.

1. TYPE A: INTERCEPT IS A FIRST PERSON SHOOTING GAME WHERE THE PLAYER SHOOTS DOWN INCOMING MISSILES AND AIRPLANES. THESE MISSILES/PLANES APPEAR ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND MOVE TOWARDS THE LEFT SIDE. A RADAR IS ALSO GIVEN TO THE PLAYER TO KEEP TRACK OF OVERALL POSITIONS OF THESE OBJECTS ON THE SCREEN. AMMUNITION IS LIMITED AND THE PLAYER MUST SHOOT DOWN A CERTAIN AMOUNT EACH LEVEL.
4. TYPE B: ENGAGE IS A FIRST PERSON SHOOTING GAME WHERE THE PLAYER SHOOTS DOWN INCOMING MISSILES AND AIRPLANES, WHICH WILL CAUTIOUSLY OPEN FIRE ON THE PLAYER. THESE MISSILES/PLANES APPEAR IN FRONT OF THE PLAYER, IN THE DISTANCE AND MOVE TOWARDS THE PLAYER. THE PLAYER HAS LIMITED ENERGY WHICH IS DECREASED WHEN HIT BY AN ENEMY. A RADAR IS ALSO GIVEN TO THE PLAYER TO KEEP TRACK OF OVERALL POSITIONS OF THESE OBJECTS ON THE SCREEN. AMMUNITION IS LIMITED AND THE PLAYER MUST SHOOT DOWN A CERTAIN AMOUNT EACH LEVEL. 
5. TYPE C: CONFRONT IS A FIRST PERSON SHOOTING GAME WHERE THE PLAYER SHOOTS DOWN INCOMING SPACECRAFT, WHICH WILL ACTIVELY OPEN FIRE ON THE PLAYER. THESE UFOS CAN APPEAR ANYWHERE ON THE SCREEN AND THE PLAYER MUST SHOOT THEM DOWN BEFORE THEY OPEN FIRE ON THE PLAYER. EACH HIT BY AN ENEMY DECREASES THE PLAYER'S SHIELD ENERGY. A RADAR IS ALSO GIVEN TO THE PLAYER TO KEEP TRACK OF OVERALL POSITIONS OF THESE OBJECTS ON THE SCREEN. AMMUNITION IS LIMITED AND THE PLAYER MUST SHOOT DOWN A CERTAIN AMOUNT EACH LEVEL.</desc>

		<desc>THE YEAR IS 1999. THE WORLD'S MOST POPULAR TELEVISION SHOW IS SMASH T.V., AN ULTRA-VIOLENT CONTEST BETWEEN TWO ARMED-TO-THE-TEETH COMBATANTS, SET LOOSE IN A SERIES OF DEADLY ARENAS THAT ARE FILLED TO BURSTING WITH HORDES OF MINDLESS BEASTS AND KILLER ROBOTS. THE AIM OF THE GAME IS TO BLAST EVERYTHING IN SIGHT AND TRY TO GRAB MORE CASH AND PRIZES THAN THE OTHER GUY. TOASTER OVENS, VCRS, FANCY CARS AND LUXURY HOLIDAYS ARE THERE FOR THE TAKING... FOR ANYONE WHO CAN SURVIVE LONG ENOUGH TO ENJOY THEM.

SMASH T.V. IS AN INSANE SHOOT-EM-UP FROM THE BRAIN OF EUGENE JARVIS, CREATOR OF ROBOTRON: 2084. IT RETAINS THAT GAME'S FRANTIC STYLE OF PLAY AND TWO-JOYSTICK CONTROL METHOD, BUT ADDS PLENTY OF GORE, VIOLENCE, A HINT OF SATIRE AND THAT ALL-IMPORTANT TWO PLAYER MODE.</desc>

		<desc>THIS CONVERSION OF A TAITO ARCADE GAME WAS RELEASED TO COINCIDE WITH THE 1992 EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS. THE GAME SCROLLS HORIZONTALLY AT A SLIGHT ANGLE, AND RECREATES THE COIN-OP'S CLOSE-UP ZOOM EFFECT AFTER A PLAYER SCORES. ONLY A SMALL AREA OF THE PITCH IS ON SCREEN AT A TIME, BUT THERE IS A SCANNER TO SHOW THE WHOLE PITCH.

ALTHOUGH THE GAME HAS A REFEREE, HE OFTEN LOSES ATTENTION, AND THESE MOMENTS GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO FOUL, PUNCH OR SIDE-SWIPE OPPOSITION PLAYERS. ONE AND TWO PLAYER OPTIONS ARE INCLUDED.</desc>

		<name>Super Star Wars : The Empire Strikes Back</name>
		<desc>THE SEQUEL TO  SUPER STAR WARS IS, AS THE NAME IMPLIES, BASED ON EPISODE V: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, THE SECOND OF THE ORIGINAL  STAR WARS MOVIE TRILOGY. THE GAME FEATURES FAMILIAR LOCATIONS AND EVENTS FROM THE FILM, SUCH AS THE ICE PLANET HOTH, THE SEARCH FOR YODA ON THE JUNGLE PLANET DAGOBAH, AND THE FIGHT AGAINST DARTH VADER. SEVERAL LOCATIONS ARE EXPANDED, ADDING PLACES AND BOSS ENEMIES THAT DID NOT EXIST IN THE MOVIE, AND CERTAIN KEY EVENTS IN THE STORY ARE OMITTED OR CHANGED. 

AS IN THE PREVIOUS GAME, THE PLAYER IS ABLE TO CONTROL THREE CHARACTERS: LUKE SKYWALKER, HAN SOLO, AND CHEWBACCA. UNLIKE THE FIRST, EACH CHARACTER HAS BEEN GIVEN A DISTINCT SPECIAL MOVE. CHEWIE SPINS A PATH OF DESTRUCTION THROUGH ENEMIES, HAN HAS GRENADES AND A POWERFUL SLIDE, AND LUKE CAN SWITCH TO HIS LIGHTSABER AND BLOCK ONCOMING FIRE. GAMEPLAY IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE FIRST GAME, MOSTLY FOCUSING ON PLATFORMING ELEMENTS. AS BEFORE, THERE ARE MODE-7 VEHICLE LEVELS, DURING WHICH THE PLAYER IS ABLE TO PILOT A SNOWSPEEDER AGAINST ENCROACHING IMPERIAL WALKERS, PILOT THE MILLENNIUM FALCON THROUGH THE ASTEROID FIELD, AND BREAK THROUGH CLOUD CITY'S DEFENSES IN LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER. 

THE GAME'S OTHER MAJOR ADDITION IS THE INCLUSION OF A SUITE OF FORCE POWERS FOR LUKE. THEY ARE LEARNED BY COLLECTING HIDDEN ORBS ON THE DAGOBAH LEVEL, AND ADD A SECOND SPECIAL BAR THAT DEPLETES WITH EACH USAGE OF A FORCE POWER. POWER-UPS INCLUDE HEALTH ITEMS, WEAPON UPGRADES, SCREEN-CLEARING DETONATORS, AND ORBS THAT RESTORE LUKE'S FORCE POWER. PASSWORDS HAVE ALSO BEEN ADDED, AND ARE GIVEN UPON COMPLETION OF EACH OF THE GAME'S 25 STAGES.</desc>

		<desc>THE STORY OF THIS GAME IS BASED ON EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE, THE FIRST OF THE ORIGINAL  STAR WARS MOVIE TRILOGY. THE PLAYER INITIALLY CONTROLS THE MOVIE'S MAIN HERO, LUKE SKYWALKER, BUT TWO MORE CONTROLLABLE CHARACTERS JOIN LATER: THE CARELESS CAPTAIN HAN SOLO AND HIS WOOKIE SIDE-KICK, CHEWBACCA. THE GAME GENERALLY FOLLOWS THE MOVIE PLOT, ALLOWING THE PLAYER TO EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SEQUENCES, SUCH AS THE SEARCH FOR OBI-WAN KENOBI, RESCUING PRINCESS LEIA, AND THE FINAL CONFRONTATION AGAINST DEATH STAR AND ITS TIE FIGHTERS, LED BY THE MYSTERIOUS DARTH VADER.

MOST OF THE GAME LEVELS FOLLOW TRADITIONAL PLATFORM GAMEPLAY STYLE. AS LUKE, HAN, OR CHEWBACCA, THE PLAYER MAKES HIS WAY THROUGH THE LINEAR LEVELS, FIGHTING ENEMIES, JUMPING OVER OBSTACLES, AND COLLECTING POWER-UPS. THE POWER-UPS INCLUDE STANDARD HEALTH-RESTORING ITEMS, UPGRADES FOR THE BLASTER GUN (UP TO FIVE DIFFERENT UPGRADE LEVELS), AS WELL AS SPECIAL ITEMS THAT CAN BE USED FOR MASSIVE DESTRUCTION OF THE ENEMIES. LUKE USES A WEAK BLASTER GUN, BUT LATER GAINS ACCESS TO A LIGHTSABER, BEING ABLE TO FIGHT ENEMIES MELEE-STYLE. HAN AND CHEWBACCA USE STRONGER FLAME GUNS, BUT CANNOT UPGRADE TO BETTER WEAPONS.

SOME OF THE LEVELS ARE DEDICATED TO FAMILIAR STAR WARS VEHICLES (SUCH AS A LAND SPEEDER). CONTROLLING THE VEHICLE FROM A THIRD-PERSON VIEW, THE PLAYER HAS TO NAVIGATE IT THROUGH THE PSEUDO-3D ENVIRONMENTS, AVOIDING OBSTACLES AND SHOOTING AT ENEMIES ON THE WAY.</desc>

THIS REQUIRES THE PLAYER TO JUMP AND SHOOT HIS WAY THROUGH LARGE LEVELS FILLED WITH LOTS OF ENEMIES. TO GET RID OF ALL THE ENEMIES, SEVERAL DIFFERENT WEAPONS CAN BE USED, MOST OF WHICH ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR TO PLAYERS FROM PREVIOUS INSTALLMENTS OF THE SERIES: A LASER, A SPREAD-SHOT, AND A(IMPROVED) REBOUND. THERE IS ALSO THE OPTION TO GO
INTO "WHEEL-MODE" FOR A LIMITED TIME TO BECOME INVINCIBLE, LAY MINES AND SHOOT ROCKETS. THE FLAMETHROWER IS NEW TO THE SERIES AS WELL AS THE ROPE, WHICH CAN BE USED TO CLIMB WALLS, CLING TO PLATFORMS OR PICK UP OUT-OF-REACH ITEMS. MUCH LIKE IN SIDE-SCROLLING SHOOTERS, YOU CAN NOW PICK UP HOMING MISSILES AS SECONDARY WEAPONS. THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE TO PREVIOUS TURRICAN-GAMES HOWEVER, IS THE FACT THAT IN SUPER TURRICAN 2 ALMOST HALF OF THE LEVELS ARE STRICTLY LINEAR AND DON'T FEATURE ANY LARGE SECRET AREAS THAT HAVE BECOME SOMEWHAT OF A TRADEMARK OF THE SERIES.</desc>

TO GET RID OF THE NUMEROUS ENEMIES, TURRICAN CAN USE THREE UPGRADEABLE SHOTS: A SPREADSHOT, A POWERFUL LASER AND A REBOUND THAT BOUNCES OFF OF WALLS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A FREEZE-BEAM THAT CAN BE USED TO TEMPORARILY FREEZE ENEMIES. IT IS FULLY ROTATABLE, AND THEREFOR ALSO A GREAT HELP IN DISCOVERING SECRET CAPSULES. THESE CAPSULES CONTAIN POWERUPS AND CAN OFTEN BE USED TO REACH SECRET AREAS. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, TURRICAN HAS THE ABILITY TO TRANSFORM INTO AN ENERGY WHEEL (AS LONG AS HE HAS ENOUGH SPECIAL ENERGY), WHICH ENABLES HIM TO LAY MINES AND EVEN MAKES HIM INVINCIBLE.</desc>

SUPER WIDGET IS A PLATFORM GAME FOR THE SUPER NINTENDO, BASED ON THE CARTOON SHOW, WIDGET.  IT SHARES SOME SIMILARITIES TO THE GAME FELIX THE CAT IN HOW THE MAIN CHARACTER UPGRADES THEIR WEAPON AS THEY COLLECT MORE POWER-UPS.

WIDGET NAVIGATES THROUGH VARIOUS WORLDS AS HE TRAVELS TO EARTH, PICKING UP 'W' COINS - 100 EARNS HIM AN EXTRA LIFE.  THERE ARE ALSO SPECIAL POWER UPS IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES - THESE ALLOW WIDGET TO TRANSFORM INTO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CREATURES, EACH WITH THEIR OWN DIFFERENT RANGED ATTACK.  AS THE PLAYER COLLECTS MORE POWER-UPS OF THE SAME TYPE (UP TO THREE), THEY CHANGE INTO MORE POWERFUL CREATURES.  IF THE PLAYER GETS HIT WHILE TRANSFORMED, THEY CHANGE BACK TO THE PREVIOUS CREATURE.  IF THEY GET HIT WHILE AS NORMAL WIDGET, THEY LOSE A LIFE.

AT THE END OF EACH WORLD IS A BOSS CHARACTER.  THESE ARE LARGER ENEMIES THAT REQUIRE LEARNING THEIR BASIC PATTERN, AVOIDING THEIR ATTACKS, AND THEN FIRING BACK WITH YOUR OWN.  AFTER DEFEATING THE BOSS, THE PLAYER IS GRADED BASED ON HOW LONG IT TOOK TO COMPLETE THE LEVEL AND THEIR COMBAT SKILLS.  THEY ARE THEN AWARDED 'WATCHER EXPERIENCE' BASED ON THESE GRADES.</desc>

		<desc>IN THE FUTURE, THE WORLD IS CONTROLLED BY A HANDFUL OF GLOBAL CORPORATIONS (SYNDICATES).  YOU ARE THE MARKETING DIRECTOR (HIT MAN) FOR ONE OF THESE COMPANIES.  IT IS YOUR JOB TO TAKE CONTROL AWAY FROM THE COMPETITORS.  THE JOB IS NOT ONE OF DIPLOMACY, BUT ONE OF BRUTE FORCE AND PHYSICAL CONTROL.  ADVANCE YOUR WAY TO THE TOP OF THE CORPORATION BY SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING YOUR MISSIONS AND MANAGING THE MONEY YOU MAKE FROM YOUR TERRITORIES.

THE GAMEPLAY IS VISUALLY REMINISCENT OF X-COM, WITH AN ANGLED TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE, BUT IT IS REAL TIME RATHER THAN TURN BASED. YOU HAVE MISSIONS RANGING FROM INFILTRATE AND CAPTURE, TO SEEK AND DESTROY. IN EACH OF THESE YOU DIRECT A TEAM OF FOUR AGENTS AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE WORLD SHOOTING AT ANYTHING THAT GETS IN THEIR WAY.

YOU CAN UPGRADE AND MODIFY YOUR AGENTS, AS WELL AS EQUIP THEM WITH TOOLS YOU HAVE RESEARCHED OR LIBERATED FROM OPPOSING SYNDICATES.  AS YOU COMPLETE MISSIONS, YOU GAIN MORE FUNDS TO USE FOR PURCHASING AGENTS OR RESEARCHING UPGRADES AND EQUIPMENT.</desc>

		<desc>SYVALION IS A TAITO SHOOT 'EM UP THAT BUCKS TRENDS BY REMOVING THE FORCED SCROLLING AND ALLOWING THE PLAYER TO MOVE IN ANY DIRECTION AT ANY PACE THEY WISH. THE PROTAGONIST IS A GOLDEN METALLIC DRAGON WITH SEVERAL TRAILING SEGMENTS THAT CAN BREATHE FIRE IN EIGHT DIRECTIONS TO DESTROY ENEMIES - THE TRAILING SEGMENTS MAKE IT VULNERABLE, SO THE PLAYER NEEDS TO KEEP MOVING TO STAY OUT OF HARM.NNNNTHE GAME WAS ORIGINALLY RELEASED IN ARCADES IN 1988. IT WAS LATER PORTED TO THE SHARP X68000 IN 1990 AND THE SNES IN JAPAN AND EUROPE IN 1992/93 - AN AMERICAN SNES VERSION WAS PLANNED BUT CANCELLED. IN 2006, SYVALION WAS EVENTUALLY RE-RELEASED FOR THE PLAYSTATION 2 AS A PART OF TAITO LEGENDS 2, WHICH MADE IT AVAILABLE TO US AUDIENCES FOR THE FIRST TIME.NNNNDARIUS BURST, FROM TAITO'S ACCLAIMED DARIUS SERIES, FEATURES A BOSS WILL MULTIPLE FORMS. ONE OF THE FORMS GREATLY RESEMBLES THE METAL DRAGON OF THIS GAME. THE GAME WAS DESIGNED BY FUKIO MITSUJI, CREATOR OF BUBBLE BOBBLE.</desc>

		<name>T2 : The Arcade Game</name>
		<desc>AS THE TITLE STATES, THIS IS THE HOME CONVERSION OF THE ARCADE RAIL-SHOOTER BASED ON THE FILM TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY. UP TO TWO PLAYERS SHOOT THROUGH FUTURE AND PRESENT LEVELS AS ROBOTIC KILLERS REPROGRAMMED TO SERVE THE HUMAN RESISTANCE. 

BOTH PLAYERS WIELD A MACHINE GUN WITH INFINITE AMMO THAT LOWERS ITS FIRING RATE (OVERHEATS) AS IT IS CONTINUOUSLY FIRED. A SECONDARY WEAPON (MISSILE LAUNCHERS IN THE FUTURE, SHOTGUNS IN THE PRESENT) HAS LIMITED AMMO BUT DEALS HEAVY DAMAGE. POWERUPS INSIDE THE GAME WORLD INCLUDE SECONDARY WEAPON AMMO AND COOLANT FOR THE MACHINE GUNS, AND ARE SHOT TO BE COLLECTED.

T2: THE ARCADE GAME FEATURES SEVEN LEVELS BASED ON SPECIFIC SCENES OR GENERAL CONCEPTS IN THE FILM. THE FIRST FOUR LEVELS ACT AS A PRELUDE, AS THE PLAYER GUNS DOWN WAVES OF METAL TERMINATORS ACROSS A POST-APOCALYPTIC BATTLEFIELD, A BESIEGED HUMAN HIDEOUT, AND THROUGH THE SECURITY CHECKPOINTS OF THE ENEMY SUPERCOMPUTER SKYNET. AFTER DESTROYING THE COMPUTER, PLAYERS TRAVEL BACK IN TIME TO PROTECT JOHN AND SARAH CONNOR, WHILE ALSO DESTROYING EVERY SCRAP OF SKYNET RESEARCH AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF ITS MANUFACTURER. FROM THERE, PLAYERS MUST FEND OFF THE INDESTRUCTIBLE T-1000 UNTIL THE FINAL SHOWDOWN IN THE STEEL MILL.

ASSETS FROM THE MOVIE ARE USED WHEN POSSIBLE, SUCH AS VOICE CLIPS FROM ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, AND CLOSE-UP DIGITAL STILLS OF ROBERT PATRICK FOR THE FINAL BATTLE AGAINST THE T-1000. THE GENESIS AND SNES VERSIONS ALSO SUPPORT LIGHTGUNS (THE MENACER AND SUPER SCOPE, RESPECTIVELY).</desc>

SOME OBSTACLES TAZ FACES ARE TREES, TELEPHONE POLES, TOUR BUSES, EVEN PTERODACTYLS WHO WILL BRING TAZ BACK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LEVEL, BUT ALSO HAVE TO AVOID CHARACTERS SUCH AS AXL &amp; BULL, A PAIR OF GATORS WHO TRY TO CAPTURE TAZ FOR THE ZOO, THE SHE-DEVIL WHO IS IN LOVE WITH TAZ AND IF THE PLAYER IS CAUGHT BY HER, THE GAME IS INSTANTLY OVER AND WENDAL T. WOLF, WHO WILL JUMP ON TAZ'S BACK AND COVER THE SCREEN WITH HIS HANDS MAKING IT HARD TO SEE.

YOU CAN AVOID SOME OBSTACLES BY USING TAZ'S TORNADO SPIN, BUT USING THE SPIN WILL CAUSE TAZ'S HEALTH METER TO DROP, BUT IT CAN BE REFILLED BY EATING KIWI'S ALONG WITH BLUE AND RED BIRDS, BUSHRATS AND ITEMS THROWN TO TAZ BY DIDGERI DINGO, BUT BEWARE, HE CAN ALSO THROW OBSTACLES AT TAZ AS WELL INCLUDING T.N.T.  THERE IS ALSO A BONUS STAGES AFTER COMPLETING THREE LEVELS IN WHICH YOU COLLECT AS MANY ITEMS YOU CAN IN THE ALLOTTED TIME TO RAISE THE SCORE.</desc>

		<desc>TWO OF THE MOST POPULAR PUZZLE GAMES RETURN, BUT NOW TOGETHER IN AN EXCLUSIVE COMPILATION FOR SNES. THE GAMES HAVE A SLIGHT GRAPHICAL UPDATE WHEN COMPARED WITH THE ORIGINAL GAME BOY AND NES GAMES, BUT THE GAMEPLAY REMAINS TOTALLY FAITHFUL TO THE GAMES RELEASED FOR BOTH PLATFORMS.

IN TETRIS, THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO PILE BLOCKS THAT WILL FALL DOWN CONTINUOUSLY, IN ORDER TO CREATE A ROW OR "LINE" WITHOUT SPACES. FOR THIS COLLECTION, THE GAME COMES WITH TWO BONUS OPTIONS: 2 PLAYER GAME (ABSENT IN THE NES VERSION) AND VS. COM (ABSENT IN BOTH VERSIONS), WITH 3 CPU OPPONENTS AVAILABLE, EACH ONE REPRESENTING A DIFFICULTY LEVEL (EASY, MEDIUM, AND HARD, RESPECTIVELY).

IN DR. MARIO, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ELIMINATE ALL THE VIRUSES CONTAINED IN A BIG BOTTLE. DR. MARIO (SITUATED IN THE UPPER-RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN) WILL THROW CAPSULES WITH 6 DIFFERENT COLOR COMBINATIONS (RED-RED, RED-BLUE, YELLOW-YELLOW, RED-YELLOW, BLUE-BLUE AND BLUE-YELLOW) IN ORDER TO LINE UP AT LEAST FOUR VIRUSES OR CAPSULES OF THE SAME COLOR HORIZONTALLY OR VERTICALLY AND TO MAKE THEM DISAPPEAR. IN THIS COMPILATION, THE GAME COMES WITH A BONUS OPTION: VS. COM, WHERE YOU'LL FACE THE CPU PLAYERS: BLUE VIRUS (EASY), YELLOW VIRUS (MEDIUM), AND RED VIRUS (HARD).

FOR COMPETITIVE PLAYERS IN BOTH GAMES, THERE IS MIXED MATCH, WHERE YOU AND A FRIEND CAN PLAY TETRIS AND DR. MARIO LIKE A TOURNAMENT! ADJUST THE HANDICAP LEVELS, PLAY TIME, MUSIC, AND OTHER SETTINGS TO BALANCE YOUR DIFFERENT SKILLS. THE GAME ORDER IS: TETRIS B-TYPE (CLEAR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LINES), DR. MARIO (DISINFECT A PREDETERMINED NUMBER OF VIRUSES) AND TETRIS A-TYPE (CLEAR LINES UNTIL THE TIME EXPIRES). AT THE END OF THE TIME LIMIT, THE PLAYER WITH THE HIGHEST SCORE IS THE WINNER.</desc>

EACH OF THE GAME'S EIGHT LEVELS (OR EPISODES) SENDS BATMAN AGAINST ONE PARTICULAR VILLAIN. MOST LEVELS PRESENT BATMAN WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF HENCHMEN TO TAKE OUT AND ENVIRONMENTAL DANGERS TO AVOID ON HIS WAY TO ONE OR MORE BOSS BATTLES, BUT SOME DEVIATE FROM THE NORM. FOR INSTANCE, CATWOMAN'S STAGE IS A LARGE CHASE OVER GOTHAM CITY'S ROOFTOPS WITH NO ENEMIES BESIDES CATWOMAN HERSELF. IN THE PENGUIN'S LEVEL, BATMAN MUST NAVIGATE THE DARK CORRIDORS OF GOTHAM CITY'S MUSEUM, RESCUING THE STAFF. TWO-FACE'S LEVEL IS A DRIVING SEQUENCE, SEEN FROM A TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE.

BESIDES KICKS, THROWS AND PUNCHES, BATMAN CAN USE A VARIETY OF EQUIPMENT AGAINST THE ENEMIES. ALWAYS AVAILABLE ARE BATARANGS AND THE GRAPPLING HOOK. BEFORE EACH MISSION, BATMAN CAN ALSO SELECT ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT, LIKE KNOCKOUT GAS SPRAY, THROWING STARS, SMOKE BOMBS AND PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES, ALL WITH LIMITED AMMUNITION. SPECIAL EQUIPMENT REQUIRED FOR CERTAIN LEVELS INCLUDE A FLASHLIGHT, GAS MASK AND X-RAY GOGGLES. IF SOME NECESSARY EQUIPMENT IS MISSING, IT IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO RETURN TO THE BATCAVE TO CHANGE THE GEAR AND THEN RESTART THE CURRENT LEVEL.

MANY OF THE SITUATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTS OF THE LEVELS ARE BASED ON EPISODES FROM THE SERIES AND THE GAME'S GRAPHICS EMULATE THE ANIMATION AND DRAWING STYLE OF THE SHOW.</desc>

ALONG THE WAY THE FIRE FIGHTERS WILL ENCOUNTER OBSTACLES THAT WILL STOP OR KILL THE PLAYER INCLUDING COLLAPSING FLOORS AND EXPLOSIVE BARRELS.

		<name>The Peace Keepers</name>
		<desc>IT'S THE YEAR 2015 AND THE MOST POWERFUL ORGANIZATION OF THE PLANET, A COMPANY NAMED DEUTSCHLAND MOLDAVIA, IS THREATENING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD BY GENETICALLY MANIPULATIN HUMANS INTO MINDLESS SLAVES OR POWERFUL MONSTERS.

THE PEACE KEEPERS IS A SIDE-SCROLLING FIGHTING GAME SIMILAR TO GAMES IN THE FINAL FIGHT SERIES. THE PLAYER CAN CHOOSE FROM FOUR CHARACTERS (PLUS TWO THAT BECOME AVAILABLE LATER IN THE GAME) WITH DIFFERENT STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. IN ADDITION TO COMBINATIONS OF STANDARD ATTACKS, JUMP-, RUN-  AND THROWING ATTACKS, ALL CHARACTERS CAN ALSO BLOCK ATTACKS, PERFORM SINGLE HEAVY ATTACKS, SPECIAL ATTACKS THAT CONSUME A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND SUPER ATTACKS. SUPER ATTACKS DAMAGE ALL ENEMIES ON-SCREEN, BUT CAN ONLY BE USED TWICE PER CONTINUE. IF A CHARACTER IS HIT REPEATEDLY, THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THEY TEMPORARILY SWITCH INTO "ANGRY-MODE" DURING WHICH THEY ARE INVINCIBLE AND MORE POWERFUL. 

MOST LEVELS OFFER DIFFERENT PATHS AND EXITS, AND AFTER EVERY LEVEL, A DIFFERENT CHARACTER MAY BE SELECTED. THIS MEANS THAT LEVELS MAY BE PLAYED THROUGH IN DIFFERENT ORDERS AND THAT IT IS NOT AT ALL NECESSARY TO PLAY THROUGH ALL THE LEVELS TO REACH ONE OF SEVERAL ENDINGS.</desc>

THE PLAYER CHOOSES A CHARACTER, FROM AMONG PRINCE REN AND HIS TWO COMPANIONS TULA AND IOZ, WHO DIFFER IN STRENGTH AND AGILITY, BUT WHO USE THE SAME BASIC ATTACKS. THERE ARE TWO ATTACK BUTTONS, ONE FOR FAST ATTACKS AND COMBINATIONS AND ONE FOR A SINGLE HEAVY ATTACK. OTHER CONTROLS INCLUDE: BLOCKING ATTACKS, GRABBING AND THROWING OPPONENTS, DASH ATTACKS WHILE RUNNING, AND A SPECIAL ATTACK THAT HITS MULTIPLE ENEMIES CONSUMING LIFE ENERGY AT THE SAME TIME. MOST LEVELS ALSO REQUIRE YOU TO AVOID OBSTACLES LIKE CHASMS, FALLING ROCKS OR SPIKES THAT SHOOT OUT OF THE GROUND.</desc>

		<desc>THIS VERSION OF THE THE UNTOUCHABLES IS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER VERSIONS.  WHILE THE OTHER VERSIONS ARE BASED ON THE BRIAN DE PALMA FILM STARRING KEVIN COSTNER, THIS VERSION IS BASED ON THE 1993 REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL 1960'S SERIES THAT STARRED ROBERT STACK.

THERE ARE FIVE DIFFERENT ASSIGNMENTS (MISSIONS) TO CHOOSE FROM, EACH WITH THEIR OWN SET TIME LIMIT.  THE FIRST MISSION IS SET IN THE OVER THE SHOULDER, THIRD-PERSON PERSPECTIVE IN AN ALLEYWAY USING A SHOTGUN TO TAKE DOWN MOBSTERS HIDING IN BUILDINGS.  THE SECOND MISSION IS A 2D SIDE-SCROLLER SET IN A WAREHOUSE WHERE THE PLAYER MUST DEFEND AGAINST GANGSTERS AND PICK UP COUNTERFEITING PLATES SCATTERED THROUGHOUT A WAREHOUSE.  THE THIRD MISSION IS A SIDE-SCROLLING SHOOTER, LOCATED ON A DOCK, WHERE THE PLAYER USES A TOMMY GUN TO TAKE OUT VARIOUS BAD GUYS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE STAGE.  THE FOURTH MISSION IS A TOP-DOWN SHOOTER LOCATED AT THE TOP OF A COURTHOUSE WHERE THE PLAYER MUST RESCUE HOSTAGES WHILE DEFENDING AGAINST VARIOUS BAD GUYS.  THE FIFTH AND FINAL MISSION IS A FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER LOCATED ON THE ROOFTOPS OF CHICAGO AGAINST AL CAPONE HIMSELF. 

THE STORY IS TOLD BETWEEN MISSIONS THROUGH OLD-TIME LOOKING NEWSPAPERS THAT REPORT ON THE SUCCESS OR THE FAILURE OF THE PLAYER'S MISSION.</desc>

		<desc>THE WIZARD OF OZ FOR THE SNES IS A RE-TELLING OF L. FRANK BAUM'S CLASSIC STORY AS STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY MGM'S 1939 MUSICAL.  TO A LESSER DEGREE, INDIVIDUAL LEVELS ADAPT LOCATIONS FROM THE 1993 WIZARD OF OZ ANIMATED SERIES BY DIC BY USING SETTINGS FROM THE SERIES, SUCH AS TIME TOWN.

THE GAME IS A PLATFORM ADVENTURE, WHICH HIGHLY ENCOURAGES EXPLORATION.  THE ACTION IS SPLIT INTO FOUR WORLDS.  IN EACH OF THE FIRST THREE WORLDS, THE SCARECROW, TIN MAN, AND LION CAN BE FOUND, WHILE IN THE LAST RATHER THAN GAIN A COMPANION THE WITCH MUST BE FOUGHT.  AFTER GAINING A COMPANION, THE CHARACTERS MAY BE SWITCHED ON THE FLY, AND EACH COMPANION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ATTACKS AND ABILITIES.  SEVERAL OF THE LEVELS REQUIRE USING A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THESE ABILITIES TO FULLY EXPLORE. THE GAME ALSO INCLUDES A VARIETY OF MINI-GAMES WHICH GIVES THE PLAYER A CHANCE TO PLAY AS TOTO ALSO.

ALL LEVELS CAN BE REVISITED ONCE PASSED AND DOING SO REQUIRED BOTH FOR THE PURPOSES OF STOCKING UP ON ITEMS AND TO FIND THE EMERALD CITY TICKETS WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO ENTER THE FINAL AREA.</desc>

THE FIRST TASK IS TO SET UP YOUR RIDES WITHIN THE AVAILABLE LAND, STRUCTURING CONVENIENT PATHS AND QUEUES AND IDEALLY LEAVING SOME SPACE FOR BIGGER RIDES ONCE THEY BECOME AVAILABLE, AND INCLUDE SOME LAKES AND TREES TO INCREASE THE PARK'S ALLURE. RIDES RANGE FROM TEACUPS AND HAUNTED HOUSES TO THE BIGGEST MOST ELABORATE ROLLER-COASTER YOU CAN DESIGN, AND WATER RIDES THAT LOOP AROUND OTHER RIDES.

		<desc>BASED OFF OF THE JEAN CLAUDE VAN DAMME FILM TIMECOP, THIS GAME ACTS AS A SEQUEL OF SORTS. WE LEARNED WELL FROM THE FILM THAT THE POWER TIME TRAVEL AFFORDS CORRUPTS ALL MEN WEAKER THAN THE MUSCLES FROM BRUSSELS, AND THIS HAS EXTENDED TO THE ORIGINAL INVENTOR OF TIME TRAVEL. HE PROCLAIMS HIMSELF DICTATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, CAPTURES VAN DAMME AS HE ARRIVES FROM FIXING ALL THE WRONGS IN THE FILM, AND CHALLENGES HIM TO A "DUEL ACROSS TIME." PLATFORMING ACTION FOLLOWS ACROSS MULTIPLE PERIODS OF HISTORY.

THE PRIMARY FEATURE OF THIS GAME IS ITS DIGITIZED CHARACTERS, UNCOMMON FOR CONSOLE GAMES OF THAT ERA. ACTORS WERE TAPED IN FRONT OF A BLUESCREEN AND STILLS WERE TAKEN FROM THE VIDEO TO CREATE ALL CHARACTERS AND THEIR ANIMATIONS. THE EFFECT IS IMPRESSIVE FOR THE SNES, THOUGH IT DOES RESULT IN ROBOTIC ENEMIES WHO DO NOT RESPOND WELL TO BEING PUNCHED OR KICKED. THE "TIMING,", BOTH IN TERMS OF CONTROLLING YOUR CHARACTER AND FIGHTING WITH ENEMY CHARACTERS SEEMS OFF THROUGH THE ENTIRE GAME.

THERE ARE 15 LEVELS IN TOTAL, MOST OF WHICH ARE STANDARD FIGHTING PLATFORM LEVELS. THREE BASIC FIGHTING MOVES ARE AVAILABLE TO THE CHARACTER, NOT INCLUDING JUMPING AND CROUCHING KICKS, AND NOT INCLUDING THE USE OF A GUN WITH EXTREMELY LIMITED AMMO. SOME VEHICLE LEVELS ARE MIXED IN, AND THE GAME CULMINATES IN A JETPACK DUEL OVER LOS ANGELES WITH THE VILLAINOUS TIME TRAVEL CREATOR FELLOW.

THE GAME ALSO FEATURED SOME RARE USE OF DIGITAL VOICE, PRIMARILY IN THE "FBI... GET ON IT!" BACKGROUND THEME IN THE FIRST FEW LEVELS.</desc>

THE GAME TAKES PLACE OVER A WEEK WITH EACH DAY BEING A DIFFERENT STAGE. STAGES ARE BROKEN DOWN INTO 4 PARTS. THE FIRST PART IS A TRAINING SECTION WHERE PLAYERS CAN PRACTICE SHOOTING. THE NEXT TWO PARTS ARE ACTION SCENES. IN THE ACTION SCENES, GAMEPLAY CONSISTS OF MOVING A CROSS-HAIR OVER VARIOUS ENEMIES AND SHOOTING THEM. THE FINAL PART ENDS THE DAY WITH A SHOWDOWN. THE SHOWDOWN INVOLVES A ONE ON ONE DUEL IN WHICH A DRAW ICON WILL RANDOMLY POP UP ANYWHERE ON THE SCREEN WHICH MUST BE SHOT THEN IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS THE ENEMY THE PLAYER IS FACING THEN MUST ALSO BE SHOT. THIS CONTINUES ON UNTIL EITHER THE PLAYER'S OR THE ENEMY'S LIFE BAR IS DRAINED.

IF A PLAYER DOESN'T SHOOT AN ENERGY CANTEEN DURING A LEVEL A BONUS SCREEN WILL APPEAR. THE BONUS SCREEN SHOWS A WOMAN SPINNING AROUND ON A ROUND BOARD WITH STARS NEXT TO HER BODY. SHOOTING THE STARS WITHOUT MISSING AND WITHOUT ACCIDENTALLY SHOOTING THE WOMAN WILL HELP PLAYERS PICK UP LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY.

AT THE END OF A LEVEL THE AMOUNT OF MONEY MADE IS TALLIED UP. FOR EVERY BULLET WASTED AND DAMAGE TAKEN THE PLAYER LOSES MONEY. THE PLAYER GAINS MONEY EQUAL TO THE THEIR ACCURACY AND THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THEY HAD LEFT AT THE END OF THE STAGE.</desc>

THE REST IS MORE LOOSELY ADAPTED: IN CONTRAST TO THE COMIC, WHICH IS MOSTLY BASED IN PERU, THIS GAME OFFERS MANY DIFFERENT LOCATIONS ALL OVER THE WORLD.

THE GAMEPLAY ITSELF IS A TYPICAL PLATFORMING ACTION: TINTIN WALKS THROUGH THE LEVELS WHILE AVOIDING THE ENEMIES. PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE, E.G. LITTLE GIRLS AND SECURITY GUARDS, IS OUT TO HURT TINTIN WHO HAS NO MEANS OF DEFENDING HIMSELF. THIS MEANS THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS LEARNING ENEMY PLACEMENTS, THEIR PATTERNS AND HOW TO AVOID THEM. BUT HE HAS TO HURRY BECAUSE OF THE TIME LIMIT. REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS IS THE USAGE OF THE TWO PLAYING PLAINS: FROM THE PLAYER'S PERSPECTIVE IN THE FOREGROUND AND FURTHER TOWARDS THE BACKGROUND.

		<name>Tom and Jerry</name>
		<desc>BASED ON MGM'S WORLD-KNOWN CARTOON, THE PLAYER CONTROLS JERRY, THE MOUSE (IN 2-PLAYER MODE, P2 WILL CONTROL JERRY'S NEPHEW, TUFFY) AS HE EXPLORES FOUR DIFFERENT WORLDS (MOVIE THEATER, JUNKYARD, A TOY-BASED STAGE AND THE HOUSE INNER). GAME CONTROLS ARE SIMPLE: B BUTTON MAKES JERRY/TUFFY TO JUMP (TAPPING IT AGAIN LIGHTLY UPON LANDING WILL ACTIVATE THEIR SUPER JUMPS), WHILE A/Y/X BUTTONS WILL MAKE THEM TO THROW MARBLES UPWARD (Y BUTTON) AND DOWNWARD (X/Y BUTTONS) IN THE ENEMIES.

TO EARN EXTRA LIVES THROUGHOUT THE GAME, PLAYERS HAVE TWO AVAILABLE OPTIONS: THE RAREST AND, SOMETIMES, HARDEST WAY IS TO FIND A 1-UP ICON; HOWEVER, THE EASIEST MODE IS TO COLLECT 100 OF SMALL BALLS OF CHEESE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE LEVELS (CHEESE BITS). ALSO, JERRY AND TUFFY'S HEALTH METERS ARE DISPLAYED IN THE FORM OF FOUR HEARTS, THAT CAN BE REPLENISHED THROUGH COLLECTIBLE LARGER CHEESE WEDGES (CHEESE CHUNKS). AT THE END OF EACH WORLD, JERRY AND TUFFY WILL TAKE A CONFRONTATION WITH TOM, THE CAT.</desc>

		<name>Top Gear 2</name>
		<desc>THIS THIRD-PERSON RACING GAME RESEMBLES GREMLIN'S EARLIER LOTUS SERIES, IN TERMS OF ITS GENERAL LOOK AND FEEL, RIGHT DOWN TO THE TEXT FONT USED IN THE GAME. YOUR TASK IS TO RACE THROUGH 16 COUNTRIES, EACH OF WHICH FEATURES FOUR RACES, WITH MANY REAL-WORLD CIRCUITS RECREATED IN INCONGRUOUS LOCATIONS (SUCH AS THE MONZA LAYOUT IN AYERS ROCK, AND THE OLD HOCKENHEIM IN VANCOUVER). 

THESE FOUR-RACE BLOCKS EACH REPRESENT THEIR OWN MINI-CHAMPIONSHIP, IN WHICH YOU RACE AGAINST 19 CARS, NEEDING TO FINISH IN THE TOP 10 TO CONTINUE, AND WITH THE TOP 6 SCORING POINTS 10-6-4-3-2-1, AND THE RESPECTIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THOUSANDS. THIS CAN BE SPENT ON VARIOUS UPGRADES, RANGING FROM ENGINE TO TIRES (WET AND DRY) AND FROM SHOCKS (FRONT, SIDE AND REAR) TO GEARBOXES. THE IDEAL APPROACH IS TO BUY THE MORE EXPENSIVE VERSIONS ASAP, AS YOU GET NO SAVING WHEN UPGRADING. IF YOU WIN THE FOUR-RACE CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU GET THE NEXT PASSWORD. 

YOU GET A SET AMOUNT OF NITRO BOOST TO USE DURING EACH RACE, ALTHOUGH BONUS NITROS, MONEY AND INSTANT SPEED-UP TOKEN APPEAR ON MANY TRACKS. HAZARDS SUCH AS PUDDLES, BARRIERS AND RAMPS ARE ALSO FREQUENT.</desc>

		<desc>TOP GEAR É O PRIMEIRO JOGO DA FRANQUIA TOP GEAR, LANÇADO EM 1992. É UM JOGO DE CORRIDA, E É UM DOS PRIMEIROS JOGOS DESSE GÊNERO PARA O SNES. O OBJETIVO DO JOGO É SE TORNAR O PILOTO MAIS RÁPIDO DO MUNDO CORRENDO EM VÁRIOS PAÍSES.

A JOGABILIDADE CONSISTE EM SIMPLES COMANDOS, UM BOTÃO DE ACELERAÇÃO, DE FREIO, TURBO OU NITRO E DOIS DIRECIONAIS PARA ESQUERDA E DIREITA. O JOGO SIMULA AS PISTAS EM PERSPECTIVA CÔNICA E SIMULA AS CURVAS DESVIANDO A PISTA PARA A ESQUERDA OU PARA DIREITA. INDEPENDENTE DA JOGABILIDADE SIMPLES O JOGO AUMENTA O NÍVEL DE DIFICULDADE NO DECORRER DAS PARTIDAS, COM PISTAS COM CURVAS ACENTUADAS E COM OBSTÁCULOS. O CARRO FICA SEMPRE AO CENTRO DA TELA E O CENÁRIO SE MOVE CONFORME OS MOVIMENTOS DO CARRO.

ALÉM DISSO, O PILOTO TEM DE FAZER O USO DE ESTRATÉGIAS, UMA VEZ QUE HÁ A NECESSIDADE DE SE ENTRAR NOS BOXES PARA REABASTECIMENTO. ASSIM, COMO ALGUMAS CORRIDAS PRESSIONAM O JOGADOR A PARAR PARA REABASTECIMENTO, DEPENDENDO DO CARRO, ISSO FAZ COM QUÊ O JOGADOR PLANEJE QUAL CARRO ESCOLHER, QUANDO PARAR NOS BOXES, A QUANTIDADE DE COMBUSTÍVEL COLOCADA NO CARRO (QUANDO SAIR DOS BOXES), E QUANDO É O MOMENTO CERTO PARA USAR OS NITROS (TURBOS).</desc>

		<desc>SIDE-SCROLLING SHOOT-EM-UP, IN A SIMILAR STYLE TO SUCH GAMES AS GRADIUS, R-TYPE AND SCRAMBLE. THE AIM IS TO WIPE OUT THE ENEMY, WHICH HAS GATHERED AROUND THE ALLIED AIRSPACE OF 'AREA 88', IN A SERIES OF MILITARY AIRCRAFT-BASED SCENARIOS.
 YOU CHOOSE ONE OF THREE UNIQUE PILOTS; SHIN KAZAMA, MICKY SCHYMON OR GREG GATES, EACH WITH VARYING ABILITIES AT DAMAGE REPAIR, WEAPON HANDLING AND FLYING SKILL, AND ENGAGE THE ENEMY OVER A SERIES OF CHALLENGING MISSIONS. THE PLAYER STARTS OUT WITH THE WEAKEST PLANE, THE F8E CRUSADER, WHICH CAN ONLY BE ARMED WITH A VERY BASIC RANGE WEAPONS. BUT, THROUGH COMPLETING VARIOUS MISSIONS, ENOUGH CASH CAN BE RAISED TO PURCHASE HIGHER-QUALITY AIRCRAFT. THESE SUPERIOR PLANES ARE MORE AGILE, HAVE IMPROVED RESILIENCE TO DAMAGE AND HAVE A GREATER RANGE OF FIRE. FURTHERMORE, THE MORE ADVANCED FIGHTERS CAN BE ARMED WITH SUPERIOR SPECIAL WEAPONS, SUCH AS NAPALM.
 THE MISSIONS INCLUDE ATTACKS ON SAND BASES, THE NUCLEAR SUBMARINE 'SEAVET' AND ENEMY SUPPLY CAMPS, AS WELL AS SEEING OFF GROUPS OF AIRBORNE 'BANDITS' WHO SWARM-IN ON AREA 88.
 THE ENEMY IS PLENTIFUL, AND THE PACE IS FRANTIC. SHOOT AT EVERYTHING ON THE SCREEN THAT MOVES, AND THE ALLIED FORCES MIGHT JUST COME OUT ON TOP......</desc>

AFTER CRASHING HIS SHIP ON EARTH WHILE IN PURSUIT OF THE EVIL ALIEN BEMULAR, THE SUPER-BEING ULTRAMAN IS HERE TO HELP WHENEVER THE ATTACKING ALIENS PROVE TOO MUCH FOR HUMANITY ALONE TO HANDLE. STANDING HUNDREDS OF FEET TALL WITH INCREDIBLE STRENGTH AND AMAZING ABILITIES, HE CAN ONLY REMAIN ON EARTH FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND SO MUST DEFEAT HIS FOES BEFORE HIS POWER DRAINS COMPLETELY.

BASED ON THE POPULAR TELEVISION SHOW FROM 1967, ULTRAMAN DIRECTLY FOLLOWS THE STORY OF ITS SOURCE MATERIAL. CAST IN THE ROLE OF THE TITULAR ULTRAMAN, THE PLAYER MUST DEFEAT MANY OF THE SAME MONSTERS THAT APPEARED IN THE ORIGINAL SERIES. TAKING THE APPEARANCE OF A 1-ON-1 FIGHTING GAME, ULTRAMAN CAN PUNCH, KICK, AND GRAPPLE HIS OPPONENT, AS WELL AS USE A VARIETY OF VARIOUS SPECIAL MOVES THAT MUST BE CHARGED. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY DEFEAT HIS OPPONENT, ULTRAMAN MUST DEPLETE THEIR CONTINUALLY-RECHARGING LIFE BAR, AND AT THAT MOMENT HIT WITH HIS MOST POWERFUL SPECIAL ATTACK: THE SPECIUM BEAM. AS THE GAME CONTINUES, DIFFERENT ENEMIES MAY EVEN FIND WAYS TO AVOID THIS MOST FORMIDABLE ATTACK, AND ULTRAMAN MUST ADAPT... EACH STAGE HAS A TIME LIMIT OF ONLY THREE MINUTES, AND THERE ARE THREE LIVES AND NO CONTINUES.</desc>

THE DISARRAY THAT FOLLOWED BROUGHT ABOUT AN END TO THE NOBILITY OF THE FRANCO NAME. 100 YEARS HAVE PASSED AND PORTUGAL HAS PROSPERED THROUGH IT'S SAILING AND TRADING EMPIRES.

		<desc>WHAT DO YOU GET IF YOU CROSS SONIC THE HEDGEHOG WITH TONY HAWK'S PRO SKATER?

IT MIGHT SEEM AN ODD COMBINATION, BUT IT DESCRIBES UNIRACERS PERFECTLY. ONE OF THE MORE SUCCESSFUL RELEASES OF THE SUPER NINTENDO'S TWILIGHT ERA, UNIRACERS MIXES PLATFORM-BASED HIGH-SPEED RACING, WITH CRAZY STUNTS AND TRICKS.

THE BASIC IDEA IN MOST LEVELS OF THE GAME IS SIMPLE. GET YOUR UNICYCLE FROM A TO B AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, AND FINISH AHEAD OF YOUR OPPONENT. IT'S LIKE SONIC, BUT WITH NONE OF THOSE PESKY ENEMIES, POINTLESS POWER-UPS AND FRUSTRATING OBSTRUCTIONS. IN FACT IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH OF A GAME AT ALL...

HERE'S THE KEY, THOUGH. TRICKS PERFORMED AND LANDED DURING THE RACE INCREASE YOUR SPEED. THE BETTER THE TRICK, THE GREATER YOUR INCREASE IN SPEED WILL BE.

ALSO, SOME LEVELS ARE SET IN AREAS DESIGNED SOLELY FOR STUNTS. SUCH LEVELS REQUIRE YOU TO EARN AS MANY STYLE POINTS AS POSSIBLE, BY DOING TRICKS. THESE LEVELS ARE AGAINST THE CLOCK, AND A SET POINTS SCORE, RATHER THAN AN OPPONENT.

UNICYCLES ARE STUPID AND DIFFICULT, AND YET FUN, ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF THEM. MUCH THE SAME COULD BE SAID ABOUT UNIRACERS...</desc>

		<name>Universal Soldier (Proto.)</name>
		<desc>UNIVERSAL SOLDIER WAS IN DEVELOPMENT BY A COMPANY CALLED CAROLCO AND WAS TO BE PUBLISHED BY ACCOLADE. THE GAME WAS ACTUALLY A SEQUEL TO THE MANFRED TRENTZ GAME, TURRICAN, BUT THE CHARACTER SPRITE WAS CHANGED SO THAT IT COULD BE REBRANDED AS A MOVIE TIE-IN. A ROM OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE COMPLETE VERSION OF THIS GAME EXISTS. THE ENEMIES AND GAMEPLAY CLOSELY MATCH TURRICAN, AS TO BE EXPECTED. IT IS UNKNOWN WHY THIS GAME WAS CANCELED. GENESIS AND GAME BOY VERSIONS OF THIS GAME WERE RELEASED, AND TURRICAN 2 WAS RELEASED ON VARIOUS COMPUTER PLATFORMS. NINTENDO POWER COMMENTED IN THE OCTOBER 1992 ISSUE THAT IT WAS SIMILAR TO CONTRA, BUT COMPLAINED ABOUT THE POOR CONTROLS.
THE GAME WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED USING THE ORIGINAL C64 SOURCE CODE AND AMIGA GRAPHICS AS A BASE. AT A LATE STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT, ACCOLADE ALSO ACQUIRED RIGHTS TO PRODUCE A GAME SPIN-OFF OF THE JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME MOVIE UNIVERSAL SOLDIER AND DECIDED TO REBRAND THE GAME AS UNIVERSAL SOLDIER. TURRICAN'S SPRITE WAS CHANGED INTO A MARINE AND SEVERAL OTHER SUBSTITUTIONS WERE MADE. AMONGST OTHER CHANGES, THE EYEBALLS-WALKING-ON-FINGERS BECAME MINI TANKS, AND INSTEAD OF A LARGE MECH/STEEL DRAGON IN THE FIRST STAGE, THE PLAYER NOW FACES A LARGE REPRESENTATION OF DOLPH LUNDGREN'S CHARACTER IN THE FILM.
THE THREE SHOOT 'EM UP STAGES, CUT OUT FROM THE PORT, WERE REPLACED BY THE DEVELOPERS WITH THREE ORIGINAL STAGES (A VIETNAM JUNGLE, A FORTRESS, AND A MOTEL/CAR JUNKYARD) THAT IN THEORY SHOULD LINK THE GAME TO THE FILM'S ATMOSPHERE. THE REST OF THE ORIGINAL TURRICAN II STAGES ARE STILL PRESENT AND REMAIN MOSTLY INTACT IN OVERALL DESIGN, THOUGH SOME OF THEM APPEAR IN DIFFERENT ORDER, ALONG WITH THE THREE NEW LEVELS DIFFERENTLY SCATTERED THROUGH THEM.</desc>

THE GAME IS SET IN THE DISTANT FUTURE, WHERE YOUR JOB IS NOTHING LESS THAN COLONY ADMINISTRATOR FOR A NEW SETTLEMENT ON SOME FAR-FLUNG PLANET. YOUR AIM IS TO PROVIDE THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF LIFE RATING FOR THE COLONISTS. 

YOU DO SO BY ENSURING THAT THERE IS ENOUGH LIFE SUPPORT, POWER, HOUSING, EMPLOYMENT, POLICE AND ENTERTAINMENT TO KEEP THE CITIZENS OF YOUR COLONY HAPPY. HINDERING YOUR GOAL ARE RANDOM EVENTS SUCH AS SOLAR ECLIPSES (WHICH CAN RENDER YOUR SOLAR PANELS INACTIVE) AND ALSO A DIFFERENT, HOSTILE ALIEN RACE THAT INHABITS THE PLANETS IN THE MANY SCENARIOS AT OFFER. 

NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO BE A GOOD MAYOR BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO BE A GOOD GENERAL. RESOURCES MUST NOT ONLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO CIVILIAN RESEARCH BUT INTO WEAPONS RESEARCH, INTELLIGENCE AND THE BUILDING OF TANKS AND SPACESHIPS, IF YOU WISH TO SURVIVE LONG ENOUGH TO SEE YOUR COLONY FLOURISH INTO A METROPOLIS. AS A RULE, YOU WILL HAVE BUILT A STRONG COLONY BEFORE THE ALIENS COME, BUT THE FINAL PUSH TOWARDS A QOL OF 80% OR HIGHER CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED ONCE THERE IS NO OUTSIDE THREAT.</desc>

PLAYERS TAKE CONTROL OF A SECRETLY ASSEMBLED FORCE AND MUST TRY TO RESTORE ORDER.

WAR 2410 IS A TURN-BASED STRATEGY GAME IN WHICH PLAYERS MOVE VARIOUS UNITS, SUCH AS MECHS, TANKS, TROOPS OR PLANES OVER A GRID-MAP. UNITS DIFFER IN MOVEMENT AND ATTACKING RANGE. SOME GROUND UNITS CANNOT ATTACK AIR UNITS AND VICE VERSA. TERRAIN ALSO AFFECTS COMBAT AS SOME TYPES OF TERRAIN, LIKE TREES OR BUILDINGS IMPROVE A UNITS DEFENSE. ATTACKED UNITS ALWAYS COUNTERATTACK AS LONG AS THE ATTACKER IS WITHIN RANGE. THE GOAL OF MOST MISSIONS IS TO DESTROY ALL ENEMY UNITS, WHILE IT IS SOMETIMES NECESSARY TO CAPTURE THE ENEMIES' BASES. UNITS CANNOT NOT BE IMPROVED OR MODIFIED AND EVERY MISSION STARTS WITH ALL UNITS ALREADY IN PLACE.</desc>

WAR 3010 IS A TURN-BASED STRATEGY GAME IN WHICH PLAYERS MOVE SPACESHIPS OVER A GRID-MAP. THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SHIPS, SUCH AS FIGHTERS, MARAUDERS OR DESTROYERS, THAT DIFFER IN MOVEMENT RANGE AND WEAPON POWER. WEAPON POWER IS ALSO DIVIDED INTO LONG AND SHORT RANGE, I.E. A SHIP THAT IS VERY GOOD AT LONG RANGE COMBAT MAY HAVE POOR CLOSE RANGED WEAPONS ETC. DURING COMBAT, THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS CAN BE CHOSEN FROM A MENU: MOVEMENT, ATTACKING, TERRAIN INFORMATION, UNIT INFORMATION, A MAP OF THE BATTLEFIELD, OVERVIEW OF ALL UNITS, INCLUDING THOSE OF THE ENEMY; AND AN OPTION TO SCOUT PLANETS FOR TECHNOLOGY. WHEN AN ATTACKING UNIT IS WITHIN RANGE OF AN ATTACKED UNIT, THE ATTACKED UNIT WILL ALWAYS COUNTER-ATTACK (IF IT ISN'T DESTROYED FIRST). IN LATER MISSIONS IT BECOMES POSSIBLE TO SCOUT PLANETS FOR TECHNOLOGY AND UPGRADE SHIPS, AS WELL AS TAKE CONTROL OF SPACE STATIONS TO BUILD NEW SHIPS.

		<desc>WARIO'S WOODS IS A PUZZLE GAME SIMILAR TO TETRIS OR COLUMNS, BUT WITH A TWIST. INSTEAD OF DIRECTLY CONTROLLING THE MONSTERS AND BOMBS THAT ARE FALLING DOWN, THE PLAYER CONTROLS TOAD WHO HAS TO CARRY AROUND STACKS OF MONSTERS AND BOMBS AND TO COMBINE THEM IN THE RIGHT WAY. ONE BOMB PLUS AT LEAST TWO MONSTERS OF THE SAME COLOR HAVE TO BE COMBINED TO MAKE THEM DISAPPEAR. IF FIVE OR MORE OBJECTS ARE CLEARED AT THE SAME TIME, A DIAMOND WILL APPEAR. DESTROYING THE DIAMOND WILL CLEAR ALL MONSTERS OF THE DIAMOND'S COLOR.
THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS TO PICK UP OBJECTS. THE A BUTTON LETS TOAD PICK UP THE WHOLE STACK THAT IS IN FRONT OF HIM, THE B BUTTON LETS HIM ONLY PICK UP ONE OBJECT, EVEN IF IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A STACK, THE Y BUTTON LETS HIM KICK A MONSTER OR BOMB THAT'S IN FRONT OF HIM AND THE X BUTTON PLACES HIM ON TOP OF THE STACK THAT HE IS CARRYING. HE CAN ALSO RUN UP WALLS AND STACKS TO CATCH FALLING OBJECTS OUT OF THE AIR OR TO PICK UP CERTAIN PARTS OF A STACK.

THERE ARE 5 DIFFERENT MODES OF PLAY: A "ROUND GAME" IN WHICH TOAD HAS TO CLEAR NUMEROUS LEVELS, A MATCH VERSUS A COMPUTER CONTROLLED OPPONENT, A TWO PLAYER MODE, A "TIME RACE" MODE, AND FINALLY, AN EXTENSIVE TRAINING MODE.

THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SNES AND NES VERSIONS. DUE TO A LACK OF BUTTONS, CONTROLS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN THE NES VERSION (ALTHOUGH ALL THE MOVES FROM THE SNES VERSION ARE PRESENT). ALSO, THERE IS NO VS. MODE AGAINST THE COMPUTER, BUT THE "ROUND GAME" MODE FEATURES TWO MODES OF PLAY: ONE THAT INCLUDES BOSS-FIGHTS ON EVERY LEVEL ENDING WITH A 9.</desc>

EACH LEVEL IS PLAYED OUT AGAINST A TIME LIMIT, AND THE PATHS THROUGH THE LEVEL ARENT ALWAYS CLEAR-CUT. THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF DOORS, EACH OF WHICH NEEDS A PARTICULAR ICON TO PASS (THE ICONS REPRESENT THE DOOR TYPE, SUCH AS ICE OR BRICKS, RATHER THAN HOT WATER OR A KEY, OR ANYTHING YOUD LOGICALLY EXPECT TO CLEAR THE PATH). YOU CAN AVOID THE BADDIES, WHICH MAY BE THE BEST OPTION, AS KILLING THEM COSTS YOU SOME ENERGY THIS REDUCES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE POINTS SYSTEM.</desc>

		<desc>KABOOM!

ANNIE &amp; CLINT, TWO GUNSLINGERS, ARRIVE AT CARSON CITY AND GET CAUGHT UP IN A GUNFIGHT. IT'S RAINING BULLETS AND THERE ARE EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE. AFTER AN INTENSE BATTLE THEY ENTER THE SALOON WHERE THEY DISPOSE OF EVERY COWBOY IN SIGHT WHILE REDECORATING THE INTERIOR. OUR HEROES FLEE THE SCENE BY CLIMBING ON THE ROOF, BUT WHAT'S THAT SOUND? ... IT'S A HUGE ROBOT!

WILD GUNS IS A SHOOTER WITH A WESTERN &amp; SCI FI THEME. GAMEPLAY IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE TIME CRISIS &amp; HOUSE OF THE DEAD GAMES, WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT THE GAME ISN'T PLAYED FROM A FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE BUT FROM A THIRD-PERSON PERSPECTIVE. YOU CONTROL YOUR ON-SCREEN CHARACTER AS WELL AS THE AIMING CROSSHAIR (AT THE SAME TIME). SELECT EITHER CLINT (YES, INSPIRED BY MR. EASTWOOD) OR ANNIE AND SHOOT DOWN TONS OF ENEMIES WHILE DODGING BULLETS AND JUMPING OVER INCOMING ROCKETS.

AFTER THE CARSON CITY LEVEL, THE ACTION CONTINUES IN DESOLATION CANYON, AN AMMUNITION DEPOT, A GOLD MINE AND A ARMORED TRAIN (YOU CAN PLAY THESE LEVELS IN ANY ORDER). FINALLY THERE'S A SHOWDOWN WITH THE BIG BAD GUY. EACH OF THE 6 LEVELS IS DIVIDED INTO 3 SUBLEVELS. THE 3RD ONE IS ALWAYS A BOSS-BATTLE. DURING THE GAME YOUR STANDARD WEAPON CAN BE TEMPORARILY UPGRADED BY COLLECTING POWER-UPS. IF YOU WANT TO CREATE SOME SERIOUS MAYHEM YOU CAN DETONATE ONE OF YOUR BOMBS. ALMOST ANY OBJECT IN THE BACKGROUND CAN BE DESTROYED.

WILD GUNS HAS A TWO-PLAYER CO-OP MODE. THERE'S ALSO A SHOOTING GALLERY MODE IN WHICH YOU CAN'T DIE; THIS ONE IS ALL ABOUT SCORING AS MANY POINTS AS POSSIBLE.</desc>

		<name>Wild Snake</name>
		<desc>WILDSNAKE IS A PUZZLE GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYER MUST MANAGE FALLING SNAKES IN A  CONFINED SPACE AND KEEP THE SNAKES FROM REACHING THE TOP OF THE SPACE. SNAKES FALL AND SLITHER UNTIL THEY REACH A RESTING SPOT ON THE FLOOR OF THE SPACE. A SNAKE WILL DESTROY ANY OTHER SNAKES OF THE SAME COLOR AND PATTERN THAT IT TOUCHES WITH ITS HEAD ON THE WAY DOWN, WHICH OFTEN HAS THE CHAIN EFFECT OF LOOSENING THE PILE OF SNAKES SO THAT ALL THE SNAKES SLITHER INTO NEW POSITIONS, POSSIBLY ELIMINATING EVEN MORE SNAKES.

THE GAME IS PLAYED AGAINST A SELECTION OF BACKGROUNDS INCLUDING DESERT, FOREST, WATER, OR GRASS. FURTHER, THERE ARE 7 GAME GRIDS INCLUDING THE STANDARD GRID (A TALL RECTANGLE), X, PLUS, FLASK, DIABOLO (AN HOURGLASS PATTERN), T-SQUARE, AND OBSTACLE (WITH A NUMBER OF INTERMEDIATE BLOCKS).

THE PLAYER STARTS OUT AS A NESTLING AND EARNS HIGHER AND HIGHER DISTINCTIONS TAKEN FROM THE SNAKE REALM (GARTER SNAKE, WATER SNAKE, BOA, MAMBO, PYTHON, KING COBRA, ETC.) AS MORE SNAKES ARE CLEARED. ALSO, AS THE LEVEL INCREASES. MORE TYPES OF SNAKE PATTERNS MUST BE HANDLED. SOMETIMES, THERE IS A FLASHING RED SNAKE THAT ELIMINATES THE FIRST SNAKE IT TOUCHES. FURTHER, THERE IS OCCASIONALLY AN UNSTOPPABLE SNAKE THAT BARRELS DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SPACE, ELIMINATING ALL SNAKES IN ITS PATH.

THE GAME CAN BE PLAYED WITH 1 OR 2 PLAYERS IN EITHER EASY, NORMAL OR HARD MODE. IN THE SINGLE PLAYER MODE, THE PLAYER CAN CHOOSE WHETHER THE PREVIEW SHOWING THE NEXT SNAKE WILL BE SHOWN. IN 2-PLAYER MODE, THERE IS ALWAYS A PREVIEW WINDOW. IN FACT, THERE IS A QUEUE OF 3 SNAKES BETWEEN THE 2 PLAYER SPACES FROM WHICH THE NEXT SNAKE IS DRAWN. AS A BONUS DURING COMPETITION, MULTIPLE SNAKE ELIMINATIONS BY ONE PLAYER RESULT IN OBSTACLES APPEARING IN THE SPACE OF THE OPPOSING PLAYER.</desc>

EACH CHARACTER HAS SPECIAL ATTRIBUTES THAT HELP THE TEAM. FOR EXAMPLE, PANTHERA'S RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE ALLOWS HIM TO SQUEEZE INTO SPOTS WHERE THE OTHER 2 CHARACTERS CAN NOT TRAVEL. THE CHARACTERS CAN GATHER A NUMBER OF UNIQUE POWERUPS AND WEAPONS TO HELP THEM ON THEIR MISSION.</desc>

GENOSHA'S GOVERNMENT IS APPARENTLY USING APOCALYPSE TO BRING THEIR MUTANT POPULATION UNDER CONTROL. HOWEVER, XAVIER SUSPECTS APOCALYPSE TO FOLLOW HIS OWN PLANS AND SENDS FIVE X-MEN, CYCLOPS, WOLVERINE, PSYLOCKE, BEAST AND GAMBIT, TO INVESTIGATE.

X-MEN: MUTANT APOCALYPSE COMBINES THE GAMEPLAY OF A SIDE-SCROLLING BRAWLER LIKE FINAL FIGHT WITH ELEMENTS OF A PLATFORMER, THAT IS, PLAYERS HAVE TO FIGHT VARIOUS ENEMIES AND SURVIVE THE OCCASIONAL JUMPING-PUZZLE. MOST LEVELS ALSO FEATURE MID- AND END-BOSSES IN FORM OF ROBOTS, MONSTERS OR KNOWN SUPER-VILLAINS.

EACH CHARACTER HAS UNIQUE ABILITIES AND SPECIAL MOVES: CYCLOPS USES HIS OPTIC BLAST TO ATTACK ENEMIES FROM A DISTANCE, WOLVERINE CAN CLIMB WALLS, PSYLOCKE IS VERY AGILE AND THE BEST JUMPER OF THE TEAM, BEAST CAN CLING TO THE CEILING WHILE GAMBIT THROWS EXPLOSIVE CARDS AT HIS ENEMIES. SPECIAL MOVES ARE QUITE SIMILAR TO THOSE FOUND IN STREET FIGHTER II (WOLVERINE HAS A DRAGON-PUNCH-STYLE ATTACK AND GAMBIT'S DOUBLE KICK IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO M. BISON'S SCISSORS KICK), AND REQUIRE SIMILAR BUTTON COMBINATIONS.

WHILE MOST STAGES ARE UNIQUE FOR EACH CHARACTER, SOME CAN BE PLAYED WITH ANY OF THE X-MEN. PROGRESS IS SAVED VIA PASSWORD.</desc>

HIDDEN AREAS AND OTHER SECRETS CAN BE UNLOCKED BY SHOOTING AT LARGE GATES. THERE ARE BOSSES ALONG THE WAY THAT MUST BE DESTROYED BEFORE PLAYERS CAN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT AREA. GAME SUPPORTS SINGLE OR MULTI-PLAYER GAME MODES.</desc>
