		<name>Alien Hominid</name>
		<desc>YOU'RE A LITTLE YELLOW ALIEN.  THE FBI HAS SHOT DOWN YOUR SHIP WHILE FLYING OVER PLANET EARTH.  AND IT, QUITE LITERALLY, LANDS RIGHT ON THEIR DOORSTEP.  AFTER A SERIES OF FBI AGENTS SWIPE YOUR SHIP, WHAT OPTION DO YOU HAVE OTHER THAN TO BLOW UP EVERYTHING IN YOUR PATH TO GET IT BACK?

ALIEN HOMINID IS A 2D SIDE-SCROLLING SHOOTER WITH HEAVY REFERENCES TO THE METAL SLUG SERIES OF GAMES - FROM THE HAND-DRAWN GRAPHICS, HUGE EXPLOSIONS, RIGHT DOWN TO THE ABILITY TO EVISCERATE FBI AGENTS WHEN YOU GET UP CLOSE TO THEM.  THE GRAPHICS ARE BY FEATURED ARTIST DAN PALADIN.  YOUR GOAL, IS QUITE SIMPLY, TO GET TO THE END OF THE STAGE, AND DIE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE.  WHICH IS MADE DIFFICULT DUE TO THE FACT THAT ANY BULLET IS AN INSTANT KILL.

TO HELP YOU OUT, YOU CAN GRAB A RANGE OF POWER-UPS, SUCH AS LASERS, SPREAD SHOTS, SHOTGUNS AND MORE, AS WELL AS HIJACKING VEHICLES AND USING THEM FOR PROTECTION.  GRENADES CAN BE LOBBED, AND YOU CAN JUMP ON ENEMY SHOULDERS AND CHOOSE TO BITE THEIR HEADS OFF IF YOU LIKE, OR PICK THEM UP AND THROW THEM AT OTHER ENEMIES.  YOU CAN ALSO DIVE UNDERGROUND FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO AVOID ENEMIES - WHILE UNDERGROUND, YOU CAN DRAG AGENTS INTO THE GROUND TO KILL THEM.

THE GBA VERSION OF THE GAME IS IDENTICAL IN GAMEPLAY, HOWEVER, WITH A FEW BOSSES REMOVED (SUCH AS THE ROBOT BEE AND THE FBI BIG-FISTED TANK ROBOT).  THE PLAYSTATION 2, XBOX AND XBOX 360 VERSIONS OF THE GAME INCLUDE A SPECIAL "PDA GAME" WITH VERY SIMPLE-LOOKING GRAPHICS.  YOUR GOAL IN THIS GAME IS TO KILL ALL THE AGENTS BY HOPPING ON THEIR HEADS, AND THEN REACH THE EXIT.  INCLUDED WITH THIS GAME IS A LEVEL EDITOR, ALLOWING YOU TO MAKE YOUR OWN LEVELS AND THEN SEND THEM TO FRIENDS IF YOU HAVE THE XBOX OR XBOX 360 VERSION.</desc>

		<desc>IT'S TOUGH BEING AN INTERGALACTIC SUPERHERO WHEN YOU'VE GOT TO FINISH YOUR HOMEWORK AND MAKE IT IN TIME TO THE BASKETBALL FINALS - BUT THAT'S JUST WHAT ATOMIC BETTY, DEFENDER OF THE COSMOS, HAS TO DO!  TAKE CARE OF THE SPOILED PENELOPE WITH THE HELP OF YOUR FRIENDS WHILE YOU'RE ON EARTH, THEN BLAST OFF INTO SPACE AND COMBAT THE VILLAINOUS GENIUS, MAXIMUS I.Q. (EVIL MASTER MIND).

ATOMIC BETTY IS A MIX OF THE PLATFORM AND PUZZLE GENRES, AND PLAYS VERY SIMILARLY TO THE LOST VIKINGS, IN THAT YOU CONTROL THREE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS SIMULTANEOUSLY, EACH WITH VARYING ABILITIES.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE ATOMIC BETTY IS AIMED AT A YOUNGER AUDIENCE, THERE ARE TWO NOTABLE DIFFERENCES: FIRST, IT IS A LOT MORE DIFFICULT TO DIE, AND SECOND, THE PLAYER ONLY NEEDS TO GET ONE CHARACTER TO THE EXIT TO SUCCESSFULLY FINISH THE LEVEL.

WHEN ON EARTH, THE PLAYER CONTROLS ONE CHARACTER THAT CAN FINISH THE HOMEWORK, ONE THAT CAN PUSH OR PULL OBJECTS, AND THE LAST THAT CAN SLIDE UNDER NARROW GAPS.  IN SPACE, ONE CHARACTER CAN REPEATEDLY ATTACK AND USE SPECIAL GADGETS, ONE CAN USE A JETPACK FOR A VERY HIGH JUMP, AND THE LAST CAN GRAB ITEMS AND ENEMIES.  IN ADDITION TO THE MAIN LEVELS, THE GAME ALSO FEATURES LEVELS WHERE THE PLAYER MUST CONTROL THE SPACESHIP AS IT ZOOMS THROUGH ASTEROID BELTS AND HIGH-SPEED SPACE WARPS.</desc>

2. CLASSIC: THE SAME GAMEPLAY AS ARCADE, REQUIRING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CHICKENS TO BE SHOT, BUT NOW WITH A TIME LIMIT ADDED. CERTAIN CHICKENS CARRY TIME PACKAGES, PROVIDING TIME BONUSES.

3. MULTIPLAYER: SCORE MORE POINTS THAN YOUR OPPONENT IN A SET AMOUNT OF TIME.

THERE ARE THREE DIFFICULTY LEVELS AND SUPPORT FOR HIGH SCORES (NOT SAVED AFTER POWERING OFF). AT THE END OF EACH LEVEL, STATISTICS ARE SHOWN BASED ON THE SHOTS FIRED, HITS, ACCURACY, GENERAL SCORE, AND ENERGY OR TIME REMAINING. THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WEAPONS (PISTOL, SHOTGUN, UZI, MACHINE GUN, LASTER, FLAME THROWER AND BOMBS) AND A LIMITED AMOUNT OF AMMO. DURING GAMEPLAY, ACCURACY IS SHOWN THROUGH A THERMOMETER ON THE SCREEN. WHEN IT RISES TO THE TOP, ALL HITS ARE AWARDED WITH DOUBLE POINTS.</desc>

EACH BOMB EXPLODES INTO A CROSS-SHAPED BLAST (4 DIRECTIONS) WHICH CAN DESTROY EITHER ENEMIES OR BLOCKS. POWER-UPS MAY BE FOUND TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE BLAST, PLACE ADDITIONAL BOMBS, INCREASE THE SPEED OF THE BOMBERMAN OR TO WALK THROUGH WALLS. YOUR GOAL ON EACH LEVEL IS TO DESTROY ALL ENEMIES AND ESCAPE THROUGH THE EXIT BEFORE THE TIME LIMIT IS UP.. HITTING THE EXIT WITH A BOMB BLAST RELEASES MORE ENEMIES WHICH MUST ALSO BE DESTROYED.</desc>

		<name>CT Special Forces</name>
		<desc>CT SPECIAL FORCES IS A SIDE SCROLLING PLATFORM SHOOTER THAT HAS A SUPERFICIAL SIMILARITY TO THE GAMES OF THE METAL SLUG SERIES. THE PLAYER CONTROLS AN OPERATIVE OF A COUNTER-TERRORIST FORCE ON A MISSION AROUND THE GLOBE TO STOP TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND ARREST ITS LEADERS. THE DIGITAL PAD MOVES THE CHARACTER, WHILE THE B BUTTON SHOOTS THE WEAPON AND THE A BUTTON MAKES THE CHARACTER JUMP. THE CHARACTER CAN'T SHOOT DOWNWARDS. THE L TRIGGER CYCLES THROUGH THE INVENTORY (DISPLAYED ON THE TOP-LEFT CORNER OF THE SCREEN) AND THE R TRIGGER THROWS GRENADES (WHEN THEY ARE AVAILABLE). BY SELECTING AN AMMUNITION TYPE, THE CHARACTER USES THE CORRESPONDING WEAPON (GAS CANISTERS FOR THE FLAMETHROWER, MACHINE GUN PENTS FOR THAT WEAPON, ETC). THE DEFAULT RIFLE HAS AN INFINITE NUMBER OF BULLETS. OTHER ITEMS INCLUDE A GRAPPLING ROPE AND A PAIR OF HANDCUFFS TO ARREST SURRENDED ENEMIES. AMMUNITION AND HEALTH PACKS ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE LEVELS, AS ARE PROXIMITY MINES AND ASSORTED ENEMIES.

THE REGULAR GAMEPLAY IS OCCASIONALLY BROKE BY MINI-GAMES AND ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SECTIONS: WHEN THE CHARACTER COLLIDES WITH A RETICULE PLACARD, THE GAME SWITCHES TO A FIRST-PERSON SHOOTING GALLERY WHERE THE PLAYER HAS TO SHOOT DOWN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF TERRORISTS AND RESCUE THE HOSTAGES. WHEN COLLIDING WITH A PARACHUTE, TWO GAUGES WITH A RED LINE ON THE MIDDLE APPEAR ON THE SCREEN. THE ONE ON THE LEFT MEASURES THE POSITION OF THE FALLING CHARACTER AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT MEASURES HEIGHT. THE CHARACTER MUST BE GUIDED TO THE RIGHT SPOT, AND THE SHOOTING BUTTON MUST BE PRESSED WHEN BOTH GAUGES REACH THE RED BAR. SOME MISSION STAGES CHANGE THE GAME TO A VERTICAL SHOOTER THAT RECALLS TIGER-HELI AND SIMILAR GAMES, WHERE THE PLAYER CONTROLS A HELICOPTER VIEWED FROM THE TOP.

THE GAME HAS 4 MISSIONS, EACH WITH ITS OWN THEME: SNOW MOUNTAIN, DESERT, JUNGLE AND A CITY. A PASSWORD SYSTEM IS PROVIDED  (THE PASSWORD IS DISPLAYED AFTER THE COMPLETION OF EVERY MISSION).</desc>

THE CARTRIDGE INCLUDES SEVERAL VARIANTS OF THE GAME. THE MAIN MODE IS CALLED "XGP". ITS BASICS ARE THE SAME AS IN THE ORIGINAL: THE PLAYER'S SPACESHIP FLIES LEFT OR RIGHT OVER A SCROLLING LANDSCAPE THAT WRAPS AROUND AFTER A FEW SCREENS. THE GOAL IS DESTROY ALL INVADING ALIENS BEFORE THEY CAN CAPTURE THE HUMANS SITTING ON THE GROUND. BESIDES UPDATED GRAPHICS WITH VARIOUS BACKGROUNDS AND SPRITES FOR THE ENEMIES AND HUMANS, THERE ARE OTHER DIFFERENCES AS WELL: PLAYERS CAN SELECT FROM DIFFERENT SHIPS, ALL WITH SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WEAPONS AND RATINGS FOR SHIELDS AND SPEED. THE XGP MODE OFFERS SIX DIFFERENT LEVELS TO COMPLETE. IT CAN ALSO BE PLAYED BY TWO PLAYERS OVER THE SYSTEM LINK.

THE CARTRIDGE ALSO INCLUDES "CLASSIC" MODE, WHICH IS A PORT OF THE ORIGINAL ARCADE GAME. FINALLY, "XG" MODE IS THE SAME GAMEPLAY-WISE AS CLASSIC, BUT HAS BEEN UPDATED WITH GRAPHICS SIMILAR TO THE XGP MODE.</desc>

		<desc>THE DIGIMON PROVE THEMSELVES TO BE VERSATILE CREATURES AS THEY HOP IN CARS AND COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER IN THIS KART-STYLE RACING GAME.

THE THIRD DIGIMON GAME FOR THE GAME BOY ADVANCE, DIGIMON RACING HAS ALL THE FEATURES YOU'D EXPECT OUT OF A RACING GAME. THERE'S A GOOD VARIETY OF COLORFUL AND LIGHT-HEARTED TRACKS (15 IN ALL, INCLUDING A WIDE VARIETY OF THEMES SUCH AS JUNGLES, DESERTS, BUSY CITY STREETS, ICE TRACKS, AND GRAVEL-COVERED HILLS), NEARLY A DOZEN DIGIMON TO PICK FROM AND UNLOCK, AND SEVERAL GAMEPLAY MODES RANGING FROM CUP RACES TO TIME TRIALS. A HANDFUL OF BOSS RACES ROUND OUT THE ACTION, AND PROVIDE A CHALLENGE FOR PLAYERS.

THE TWIST TO THIS GAME COMES AS THE RACERS COLLECT ENERGY ON THE TRACK TO DIGIVOLVE INTO UPGRADED VERSIONS OF THEMSELVES. ONCE YOU'VE DIGIVOLVED, YOU CAN USE ADDITIONAL OFFENSIVE POWERS TO FURTHER HAMPER YOUR OPPONENTS AND KEEP YOUR OWN DIGIMON AHEAD OF THE OTHERS.

WHILE THE SINGLE-PLAYER GAME WILL KEEP YOU BUSY FOR A WHILE WITH ITS MANY MODES AND CHARACTERS, DIGIMON RACING REALLY SHINES IN THE MULTIPLAYER ARENA. SINCE IT INCLUDES SUPPORT FOR UP TO FOUR PLAYERS USING THE LINK CABLE OR WIRELESS ADAPTER, THE MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE IS THE REAL HIGHLIGHT OF THE GAME.</desc>

		<desc>KING K. ROOL HAS STOLEN DONKEY KONG'S BANANA STASH, AND DONKEY KONG NEEDS YOUR HELP TO GET THEM BACK. IN SEARCH OF K. ROOL, THE KREMLING HORDE IMPEDES YOUR PROGRESS. KREMLINGS, CROCODILE-LIKE CREATURES, INCLUDE KRITTERS (THEY SUCCUMB TO A SIMPLE JUMP ON THE HEAD), KRUSHAS (THEY ARE VIRTUALLY INDESTRUCTIBLE), AND OTHERS. THERE ARE ALSO OTHER ENEMIES THAT BLOCK YOUR PATH, SUCH AS BEAVERS, SNAKES, VULTURES. LEADING THEM ARE DASTARDLY BOSSES, INCLUDING VERY GNAWTY, NECKY, BUMBLE B, AND DUMB DRUM, AND THEY ALL BAR THE WAY WITH THEIR OWN SPECIAL BLEND OF VILLAINY.

DONKEY KONG IS JOINED BY DIDDY KONG: THESE TWO PRIMATES DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY. FOR EXAMPLE, DONKEY KONG IS GENERALLY STRONGER; HE CAN DESTROY MOST ENEMIES WITH A SINGLE JUMP AND CAN LIFT BARRELS STRAIGHT OVER HIS HEAD TO THROW THEM FARTHER. ON THE OTHER HAND, DIDDY IS FASTER AND NOT AS STRONG AS DONKEY; HE CAN RUN REALLY FAST AND DO CARTWHEELS. DIDDY CARRIES BARRELS IN FRONT OF HIM, CREATING A SHIELD AGAINST FRONTAL ATTACKS.

THE GAME IS SPLIT INTO DIFFERENT WORLDS, WHICH ARE SPLIT INTO DIFFERENT LEVELS. EACH LEVEL CONTAINS BONUS AREAS, WHERE ONE CAN COLLECT BANANAS, MEDALLIONS, AND LIVES. AT THE END OF EACH WORLD IS A BOSS, WHICH IS USUALLY A LARGER VERSION OF A MINOR ENEMY.</desc>

		<name>Doom II</name>
		<desc>IN THIS SEQUEL TO THE ORIGINAL DOOM, YOU PLAY THE SAME HERO - THE LAST REMAINING SPACE MARINE. AFTER HAVING SINGLE-HANDEDLY SAVED MARS FROM DEMONIC THREAT, YOU RETURN TO EARTH, ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THE DEMONS HAVE ALREADY INVADED IT, KILLED ALL ITS INHABITANTS OR TURNED THEM INTO DEMONS. IT'S YOUR TASK TO KILL ALL THE DEMONS AND TO SAVE THE EARTH.

DOOM II LOOKS AND PLAYS VERY SIMILARLY TO ITS PREDECESSOR, UTILIZING THE SAME 3D GRAPHICAL ENGINE WITH 2D SPRITES FOR ENEMIES. THE GAMEPLAY ONCE AGAIN CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF NAVIGATING THE HERO FROM FIRST-PERSON VIEW THROUGH 3D ENVIRONMENTS AND SHOOTING AT THE DEMONS WHILE ATTEMPTING TO FIND YOUR WAY OUT BY FLIPPING SWITCHES AND LOOKING FOR KEYS. UNLIKE IN DOOM, WHICH IS DIVIDED INTO THREE EPISODES, THE 30 LEVELS OF DOOM II (PLUS THE 2 SECRET LEVELS) FORM ONE LONG EPISODE. 

YOU HAVE THE SAME WEAPONS AS IN THE FIRST DOOM, PLUS A NEW ONE: A SUPER SHOTGUN. THERE ARE ALSO SOME NEW DEMONS IN THIS SEQUEL, SUCH AS THE CHAINGUN-TOTING HEAVY WEAPON DUDES, THE SKELETAL REVENANTS WHO LAUNCH HOMING MISSILES AND THE ARCH-VILES WHO HAVE A HIGHLY DAMAGING FIRE ATTACK. THERE IS ALSO ONE NEW POWER-UP, A MEGASPHERE WHICH BOOSTS YOUR HEALTH AND ARMOR TO THE MAX.</desc>

		<desc>THE UNION AEROSPACE CORPORATION HAS BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH TELEPORTATION TECHNOLOGY ON MARS' MOONS PHOBOS AND DEIMOS. AFTER EARLY SUCCESSES, SOMETHING GOES WRONG. IT SEEMS THE SCIENTISTS HAVE OPENED A GATEWAY STRAIGHT TO HELL. PHOBOS BASE IS OVERRUN WITH DEMONIC CREATURES, AND THE WHOLE OF DEIMOS SIMPLY VANISHES. A SQUAD OF MARINES IS SENT TO PHOBOS, BUT ALL EXCEPT ONE ARE QUICKLY SLAUGHTERED. IT FALLS TO THE SURVIVING MARINE TO GRAB SOME GUNS AND STRIKE BACK AT THE DEMONS.

ID SOFTWARE'S FOLLOW-UP TO THEIR GENRE-DEFINING WOLFENSTEIN 3D, DOOM IS ANOTHER FIRST PERSON SHOOTER: FULL-ON ACTION SEEN FROM THE SPACE MARINE'S PERSPECTIVE. LIKE WOLFENSTEIN, THE GAME CONSISTS OF DISTINCT EPISODES, PLAYABLE IN ANY ORDER. THE FIRST EPISODE, KNEE-DEEP IN THE DEAD, TAKES PLACE IN THE PHOBOS BASE AND IS FREELY AVAILABLE AS SHAREWARE. THE FULL GAME CONTINUES ON DEIMOS IN THE SHORES OF HELL AND CULMINATES IN INFERNO, THE FINAL EPISODE WHICH TAKES PLACE IN HELL ITSELF. EACH EPISODE CONSISTS OF NINE LEVELS, ONE OF WHICH IS A HIDDEN LEVEL.

THE BASIC OBJECTIVE IN EACH LEVEL IS SIMPLY TO REACH THE EXIT. SINCE DOZENS OF ENEMIES STAND IN THE WAY, THE ONLY WAY TO GET THERE IS THROUGH KILLING THEM. SWITCHES AND BUTTONS MUST BE 
PRESSED TO ADVANCE AT CERTAIN POINTS AND OFTEN COLOR-CODED LOCKED DOORS WILL BLOCK THE WAY - MATCHING KEYCARDS OR SKULL KEYS MUST BE FOUND TO PASS.

DOOM'S ENGINE TECHNOLOGY IS MORE ADVANCED THAN WOLFENSTEIN'S, AND THUS THE LEVELS ARE MORE VARIED AND COMPLEX. THE ENGINE SIMULATES DIFFERENT HEIGHTS (STAIRS AND LIFTS APPEAR FREQUENTLY) AND DIFFERENT LIGHTING CONDITIONS (SOME ROOMS ARE PITCH BLACK, OTHERS ONLY BARELY ILLUMINATED). THERE ARE OUTDOOR AREAS, POOLS OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE THAT HURT THE PLAYER, CEILINGS THAT COME DOWN AND CRUSH HIM, AND UNLIKE WOLFENSTEIN'S ORTHOGONALLY ALIGNED CORRIDORS, THE WALLS IN DOOM CAN BE IN ANY ANGLE TO EACH OTHER. AN AUTOMAP HELPS IN NAVIGATING THE LEVELS.

STYLISTICALLY, THE LEVELS BEGIN WITH A FUTURISTIC THEME IN THE MILITARY BASE ON PHOBOS AND GRADUALLY CHANGE TO A HELLISH ENVIRONMENT, COMPLETE WITH SATANIC SYMBOLS (PENTAGRAMS, UPSIDE-DOWN-CROSSES AND PORTRAITS OF HORNED DEMONS), HUNG-UP MUTILATED CORPSES AND THE DISTORTED FACES OF THE DAMNED.

DOOM FEATURES A LARGE WEAPON ARSENAL, WITH MOST WEAPONS HAVING BOTH ADVANTAGES AND DRAWBACKS. THE STARTING WEAPONS ARE THE FISTS AND A SIMPLE PISTOL. ALSO AVAILABLE ARE A SHOTGUN (HIGH DAMAGE, SLOW RELOAD, NOT GOOD AT DISTANCES), A CHAINGUN (HIGH FIRING RATE, BUT SLIGHTLY INACCURATE IN LONGER BURSTS) AND A PLASMA RIFLE (COMBINING A HIGH FIRING RATE AND LARGE DAMAGE). THE ROCKET LAUNCHER ALSO DEALS OUT LOTS OF DAMAGE, BUT THE EXPLOSION CAUSES BLAST DAMAGE AND MUST BE USED WITH CARE IN CONFINED AREAS OR IT MIGHT PROVE DEADLY TO THE PLAYER AS WELL AS THE ENEMIES. TWO FURTHER (IN)FAMOUS WEAPONS IN DOOM ARE THE CHAINSAW FOR CLOSE-QUARTER CARNAGE, AND THE BFG9000 ENERGY GUN, THAT, WHILE TAKING SOME PRACTICE TO FIRE CORRECTLY, CAN DESTROY MOST ENEMIES IN A SINGLE BURST. THE DIFFERENT WEAPONS USE FOUR DIFFERENT AMMUNITION TYPES (BULLETS, SHELLS, ROCKETS AND ENERGY CELLS), SO COLLECTING THE RIGHT TYPE FOR A CERTAIN GUN IS IMPORTANT.

DOOM DROPS SOME OF WOLFENSTEIN'S ARCADE-INSPIRED ASPECTS, SO THERE ARE NO EXTRA LIVES OR TREASURES TO BE COLLECTED FOR POINTS, BUT MANY OTHER POWERUPS ARE STILL AVAILABLE. MEDPACKS HEAL DAMAGE WHILE ARMOR PROTECTS FROM RECEIVING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. BACKPACKS ALLOW MORE AMMUNITION TO BE CARRIED, A COMPUTER MAP REVEALS THE WHOLE LAYOUT OF THE LEVEL ON THE AUTOMAP (INCLUDING ANY SECRET AREAS), LIGHT AMPLIFICATION VISORS ILLUMINATE DARK AREAS AND RADIATION SUITS ALLOW TRAVEL OVER WASTE WITHOUT TAKING DAMAGE. ALSO AVAILABLE ARE BERSERK PACKS (WHICH RADICALLY INCREASE THE DAMAGE INFLICTED BY THE FISTS) AS WELL AS SHORT-TIME INVISIBILITY AND INVULNERABILITY POWERUPS.

THE ENEMIES TO BE DESTROYED INCLUDE FORMER HUMANS CORRUPTED DURING THE INVASION, PLUS DEMONS IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES: FIREBALL-THROWING IMPS, FLOATING SKULLS, PINK-SKINNED DEMONS WITH POWERFUL BITE ATTACKS AND LARGE ONE-EYED FLYING MONSTROSITIES CALLED CACODEMONS. EACH EPISODE ENDS WITH A BOSS BATTLE AGAINST ONE OR TWO ESPECIALLY POWERFUL CREATURES.

DOOM POPULARIZED MULTIPLAYER IN THE GENRE WITH TWO DIFFERENT MODES: COOPERATIVE ALLOWS UP TO FOUR PLAYERS TO MOVE THROUGH THE SINGLE-PLAYER GAME TOGETHER, WHILE DEATHMATCH IS A COMPETITIVE GAME TYPE WHERE PLAYERS BLAST AT EACH OTHER TO COLLECT 'FRAG' POINTS FOR A KILL AND RE-SPAWN IN 
A RANDOM LOCATION AFTER BEING KILLED.</desc>

		<name>Dynasty Warriors Advance</name>
		<desc>DYNASTY WARRIORS ADVANCE IS A GAME BOY ADVANCE ADAPTATION OF THE DYNASTY WARRIORS FRANCHISE. BASED ON THE "THREE KINGDOMS PERIOD" OF ANCIENT CHINA,  IT TAKES PLACE AT THE END OF THE HAN DYNASTY DURING 190 A.D. AS THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT COLLAPSES, WARLORDS RISE UP AND FIGHT AMONG ONE ANOTHER, EVENTUALLY ESTABLISHING THREE POWERFUL KINGDOMS: WEI, WU AND SHU. GENERALS FROM EACH OF THESE NATIONS SPEND THE NEXT 100 YEARS FIGHTING AMONG ONE ANOTHER, EACH TRYING TO BECOME THE DOMINANT POWER.

DYNASTY WARRIORS ADVANCE IS A TOP-DOWN TURN-BASED STRATEGY BOARD GAME, BUT WITH A FOCUS ON ACTION COMBAT. SINCE IT IS BASED ON THE EARLIER DYNASTY WARRIORS TITLES, MANY OF THE SAME CONCEPTS CARRY OVER. PLAYERS BEGIN BY CHOOSING ONE OF THREE AVAILABLE CHARACTERS FROM THE LANDS OF EITHER WU, SHU OR WEI. EACH CHARACTER HAS THEIR OWN UNIQUE STORYLINE AND MISSIONS. A BRIEFING IS GIVEN FOR EACH MISSION DETAILING SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES BEFORE ALLOWING THE PLAYER TO EQUIP THEMSELVES WITH WEAPONS AND SKILLS AT THE CAMP. ONCE BEGUN, THE PLAYER MOVES THE DESIGNED NUMBER OF SPACES (DETERMINED BY MOVEMENT) AROUND THE "BOARD". IF AN ENEMY PLAYER IS ENCOUNTERED, THE GAME SHIFTS TO A TOP-DOWN ACTION FIGHTING MODE. HERE THE PLAYER USES ONE BUTTON TO ATTACK, ANOTHER BUTTON TO CHARGE AND ANOTHER TO UNLEASH A MISOU SPECIAL ATTACK ONCE IT IS POWERED UP. MISOU ENERGY IS CHARGED BY SUCCESSFUL ATTACKING ENEMY UNITS. THE PLAYER'S SUCCESS AGAINST THE ENEMY UNIT WILL DETERMINE THE UNIT'S "HEATH" AND WILL BE DESTROYED COMPLETELY IF ALL OF IT'S UNITS ARE DESTROYED. SOME ENEMY UNITS CONTAIN NOT JUST SOLDIERS BUT ENEMY GENERALS WHO HAVE THEIR OWN SPECIAL MOVES AND GREATER HEALTH. MANY MISSIONS FEATURE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES RATHER THAN JUST DEFEATING ALL ENEMIES.</desc>

THE GAME CONTENT IS EXACTLY THE SAME, BUT IT FEATURES A MULTIPLAYER MODE BETWEEN OTHER SYSTEMS (IF THEY HAVE A COPY OF THE GAME AND THE GBA LINK CABLE, OF COURSE) AND A BRAND NEW STORYLINE: THE PLAYER CONTROLS A F-14 PILOT CHOSEN BY THE US GOVERNMENT TO BE ASSIGNED IN THE THEATER OF OPERATIONS OF A WAR BETWEEN THE REPUBLICS OF CHINA AND TAIWAN TO PROTECT AMERICA'S "INTERESTS" IN THE REGION.

THE GAME INCLUDES, APART FROM THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED MULTIPLAYER MODE, A LANDING PRACTICE MODE, LIKE TURN AND BURN. IT WAS LATER IMPLEMENTED IN MAJESCO'S TWO FOLLOWING GBA FLIGHT SIMS, 2004'S SUPER HORNET F/A-18F AND 2007'S F24 STEALTH FIGHTER, WHICH RE-USED THIS GAME'S ENGINE, WITH THE OPTION OF SELECTING BETWEEN A LANDING CARRIER OR A LANDING STRIP.</desc>

		<name>Fantastic 4</name>
		<desc>THIS GAME IS A LICENSEE OF THE 2005 MOVIE "FANTASTIC 4". UNLIKE MANY LICENSED TITLES, THIS THIRD-PERSON ACTION GAME IN THE VEIN OF THE ONIMUSHA OR DEVIL MAY CRY SERIES ONLY TAKES THE BASE OF ITS PLOT FROM THE ACTUAL MOVIE, THEN LIBERALLY CHANGES IT TO MAKE FOR BETTER GAMEPLAY. GENERALLY, THE GAME BRINGS IN MORE CONTENT FROM THE COMIC BOOKS THAN THE MOVIE, PARTICULARLY CONSIDERING THE VILLAINS THAT APPEAR. WHILE THE MOVIE PRETTY MUCH ONLY CONCERNED ITSELF WITH VICTOR VON DOOM AKA "DOCTOR DOOM" AS ITS SUPERVILLAIN OF CHOICE, THE GAME BRINGS IN VARIOUS CHARACTERS FROM THE COMIC BOOKS AS WELL - THE MOLE MAN, THE PUPPET MASTER, OR DIABLO, TO NAME A FEW. THE GAMEPLAY USUALLY CONSISTS OF WALKING THE HEROIC TITLE CHARACTERS AROUND A LEVEL AND BEATING UP THE VARIOUS ENEMIES THAT CROSS THEIR PATH. THERE ARE MISSION OBJECTIVES, BUT USUALLY THE ONLY WAY TO ACHIEVE THEM LEADS THROUGH THE ENEMIES AND JUST AS USUALLY THE ONLY WAY TO FAIL THEM IS TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THE BAD GUYS. BEATING UP ENEMIES YIELDS POINTS, WHICH CAN BE USED TO UPGRADE CHARACTERS WITH NEW SPECIAL MOVES OR UNLOCK VARIOUS BONUS MATERIALS. TO SPICE IT ALL UP, DEVELOPER SEVEN STUDIOS HAVE ALSO THROWN IN A CO-OP MODE THAT ALLOWS FOR PLAYING THE NORMAL SINGLE-PLAYER MISSION IN A TAG TEAM WITH A SECOND PLAYER.</desc>

		<name>Fortress</name>
		<desc>FORTRESS IS A TETRIS-VARIANT PUZZLE GAME. AS IN THAT CLASSIC GAME, GEOMETRIC PIECES FALL FROM THE TOP OF THE SCREEN AND MUST BE ARRANGED IN LINES. ONLY INSTEAD OF ELIMINATING LINES, THE OBJECTIVE THIS TIME IS TO ADD THEM TO THE SCREEN. THE GAME STARTS WITH A TIMER (THAT COUNTS A MOMENT WHERE NEITHER PLAYER ATTACK) AND A CASTLE GATE FALLING BETWEEN TWO FLAGS (THE OPPONENT'S FLAGS CAN BE SEEN TO THE LEFT OF THE SCREEN). ONCE PLACED, THE REMAINING PIECES ARE USED TO BUILD A CASTLE AROUND IT, AS EVERY 2X3 GRID OF PIECES TRANSFORMS INTO ITS WALLS. A GRID OF 8X3 PIECES TRANSFORMS INTO A WIZARD'S TOWER THAT CAN SUMMON A CREATURE TO ATTACK THE ENEMY CASTLE. 

CERTAIN SPECIAL BLOCKS ADD FEATURES TO THE BUILDING: A CANNON BLOCK PLACES A SHOOTING CANNON THAT STARTS TO ATTACK AUTOMATICALLY THE OPPONENT'S FORTRESS. A BLOCK WITH A WINDOW ADDS ONE TO THE BUILDING. REPAIRING PEONS COME OUT OF IT TO HELP FIX THE DAMAGE TO THE CASTLE'S WALLS. A BLOCK WITH A BOMB ADDS A CANNON THAT FIRES A PEON TOWARDS THE OPPONENT'S CASTLE (AN AIMING RETICULE IS SHOWN OVER THE ENEMY CASTLE TO HELP CHOOSE THE RIGHT SPOT). BUILDING WALLS AROUND THESE SPECIAL BLOCKS PREVENT THEIR DESTRUCTION FROM THE ENEMY ATTACK. A MONSTER APPEARS RANDOMLY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN TO ATTACK BOTH PLAYERS.

THE PLAYER'S GOAL AT EACH LEVEL IS TO REACH A NUMBER OF SCORE POINTS BEFORE THE OPPONENT. THE PIECES CAN BE MANEUVERED WITH THE DIGITAL PAD, AND PRESSING UP ON IT MAKES THEM FALL FAST DOWNWARDS. THEY CAN BE ROTATED CLOCKWISE AND ANTI-CLOCKWISE WITH THE A AND B BUTTONS, RESPECTIVELY. HOLDING THE R TRIGGER ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO MOVE THE SCREEN WITH THE DIGITAL PAD (FOR A FULL VIEW OF BATTLE SCENE). WHEN PRESSED, THE L TRIGGER DESTROYS THE TOP 3 ROWS OF YOUR CASTLE AND DECREASES THE SCORE.

THE GAME HAS THREE GAME MODES: TOURNAMENT, BATTLE AND BLITZ. THEY VARY IN THE AMOUNT OF SECONDS ON THE TIMER AND THE GOAL SCORE. THERE ARE FOUR THEMES: PRE-HISTORIC, MEDIEVAL, PIRATE AND SPACE.</desc>

AS HARRY IS OFTEN IN PLACES HE SHOULDN'T BE, STEALTH SEQUENCES ARE ALSO A LARGE PART OF THE GAME. TO AVOID TEACHERS AND PREFECTS, HE CAN SNEAK AROUND SLOWLY AND HIDE BEHIND CURTAINS. IF HE IS CAUGHT, HE IS THROWN OUT (TO TRY AGAIN) AND HOUSE POINTS CAN BE DEDUCTED.

AS IN OTHER POTTER GAMES, THERE ARE A LOT OF COLLECTIBLES, FOUND BOTH IN PLAIN VIEW AND IN HIDDEN AREAS. SETS OF FAMOUS WIZARD CARDS UNLOCK BONUSES, EVERY FLAVOUR BEANS GET HARRY PASSWORDS THAT LET HIM MOVE THROUGH SHORTCUTS IN THE SCHOOL AND CHOCOLATE FROGS INCREASE HIS MAXIMUM STAMINA.

FINALLY, QUIDDITCH IS ALSO BACK IN THIS GAME, THIS TIME IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL SPACE, VIEWED FROM THE BACK.</desc>

THE ANCIENTS DISAPPEARED, LEAVING ONLY THEIR DEVICES FOR FUTURE CIVILIZATIONS TO DISCOVER.  YEARS LATER, THE "SETTLERS" ARRIVED AND BUILT THEIR CITIES IN THE LANDS WHERE THE MACHINERY WAS LEFT, AND ALL WAS PROSPEROUS.

HOWEVER, NOTHING REMAINS PERFECT FOREVER.  POWERFUL ALCHEMISTS TRIED TO HARNESS THE POWER OF THE ANCIENTS' MACHINES IN THEIR LUST FOR POWER, AND WAR BROKE OUT.  THOSE THAT TRIED TO USE THE ANCIENTS' MACHINES, OR THE DARK ALCHEMISTS, AS THEY BECAME KNOWN, WERE KILLED OR EXILED, AND PEACE EVENTUALLY RETURNED.  RUMOUR HAS IT THOUGH, THAT THE LAST OF THE DARK ALCHEMISTS, THE MONOPHONIC MENACE, HAS RETURNED TO CONQUER THE WORLD.

JUKA AND THE MONOPHONIC MENACE IS AN ACTION-ADVENTURE GAME.  THE TITLE CHARACTER, JUKA, IS AN ALCHEMIST WHO CAN COLLECT INGREDIENTS FROM TREES, WATER, BUSHES, AND OTHER PLACES TO MIX AND CREATE POTIONS.  POTIONS CAN BE USED AS A FORM OF DEFENSE AGAINST ENEMIES, CAN ALTER THE LANDSCAPE, OR EVEN ACTIVATE MACHINES.  JUKA ALSO HAS A "SOUND STAFF", WHICH CAN BE USED TO ABSORB AND FIRE BACK DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOUNDS AT CERTAIN ENEMIES.</desc>

YOU'LL CONVENIENTLY FIND CRATES FOR COVER AND BARRELS TO HELP YOU PULL OFF BIG EXPLOSIONS. LOCKING THE ENEMY IN YOUR CROSSHAIRS, SIGNIFIED BY YOUR CROSSHAIRS TURNING RED, DOESN'T GUARANTEE A DIRECT HIT? THE ACCURACY DEPENDS ON THE WEAPON OF CHOICE.

THE PLAYER IS CAST AS PEPPER RONI, A LEAD STUNTMAN IN A BIG MOVIE PRODUCTION SET ON LEGO ISLAND.

EVEN THOUGH THE PLAYER IS FREE TO GO WHEREVER HE WANTS, THERE IS A STORY BEHIND THE GAME DIVIDED OVER 25 MISSIONS. ALL THE MISSIONS ARE STUNT-BASED. RUNNING AROUND THE WORLD IN 3RD-PERSON VIEW, THE CONTROLS ARE PRETTY BASIC AND DO NOT OFFER THE TRICK COMBINATIONS OF OTHER STUNT/TRICK-BASED GAMES. IT IS EASY TO PICK UP AND PLAY, EVEN FOR THE YOUNGER PLAYERS, WITHOUT WORRYING TOO MUCH ABOUT WHAT BUTTON COMBINATION WILL DO WHAT TRICK. INSTEAD THE PLAYER CAN FOCUS ON THE MISSIONS BY ONLY HAVING TO COMPLETE BASIC TRICKS WITH A FEW BUTTON PRESSES.</desc>

		<path>./March of the Penguins (USA).zip</path>
		<name>March of the Penguins</name>
		<desc>BASED ON THE DOCUMENTARY MARCH OF THE PENGUINS, THIS GAME FOLLOWS THE STORY OF THE EMPEROR PENGUINS AS THEY EMBARK ON A LONG JOURNEY TO BREED THEIR YOUNG. THE GAME HAS BEEN DIVIDED INTO TWELVE CHAPTERS, WITH DIFFERENT GAMEPLAY. THE PENGUINS NEED TO BE NAVIGATED THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENT, FIND A SUITABLE MATE, FIND FOOD, TAKE CARE OF THE EGG, GUARD THE YOUNG ONES AND FINALLY MAKE IT ALL THE WAY BACK.

A LARGE PART OF THE GAME IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF LEMMINGS. AS THE PENGUINS MARCH ON, PLAYERS NEED TO HELP THEM LAND SOFTLY, MELT OBSTACLES, ATTRACT THEM IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION USING FISH AND PLACE TRAMPOLINES, RAMPS, SLIDES, BRIDGES AND STEPS TO MAKE THEM ACCESS NEW AREAS. THE LEVELS CAN BE EXPLORED USING BINOCULARS AND THE PENGUINS NEED TO COLLECT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SNOWFLAKES TO PASS. THE PENGUINS CANNOT DIE. WHEN THEY FALL OFF A CLIFF, THEY SIMPLY RESTART AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LEVEL, BUT THE PLAYERS NEEDS TO BRING THEM TO THE END AS A GROUP TO SUCCEED.

OTHER LEVELS HAVE THE PENGUINS SLIDE DOWN HILLS WITH FASTER GAMEPLAY, FEATURE MAZES, OR TAKE PLACE UNDERWATER WHERE PREDATORS NEED TO BE AVOIDED WHILE COLLECTING FOOD.

		<name>Mario Party Advance</name>
		<desc>THE FIRST PORTABLE INCARNATION OF THE MARIO PARTY SERIES, MARIO PARTY ADVANCE SHAKES THINGS UP QUITE A BIT ON THE GBA.  WITH THE FOCUS ON THE SINGLE-PLAYER, THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF SINGLE-PLAYER MINI-GAMES, ONE GIANT SINGLE-PLAYER BOARD TO TRAVERSE INSTEAD OF MULTIPLE ONES (SHROOM CITY), AND ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT GADDGETS AND GAMEPLAY MODES TO INDULGE IN.

THE MAIN SINGLE-PLAYER EXPERIENCE INVOLVES TRAVELING ACROSS "SHROOM CITY," WHICH IS A MAJOR DEPARTURE FROM THE STANDARD SET-UP IN PAST MARIO PARTY TITLES.  YOU HAVE THE CHOICE TO BE MARIO, LUIGI, PEACH, OR YOSHI, AND DEPENDING ON WHO YOU CHOOSE, YOU'LL START AT A DIFFERENT SPOT ON THE BOARD, WHICH IS QUITE LARGE.

YOU'RE GIVEN DIE ROLLS TO NAVIGATE THE BOARD AND, WHEN YOU REACH SPECIAL SECTIONS OF THE MAP, COMPLETE SPECIAL QUESTS, WHICH OFTEN INVOLVE HELPING RESIDENTS OF SHROOM CITY AND/OR PARTICIPATING IN SPECIAL CHALLENGES.  MOST QUESTS INVOLVE COLLECTING SOME SORT OF OBJECT ELSEWHERE OR A MINI-GAME.  BY COMPLETING THESE QUESTS, YOU'LL COLLECT STARS, WHICH EVENTUALLY ALLOW FOR SPECIAL BOSS BOUTS WITH BOWSER, AND YOU'LL UNLOCK MINI-GAMES AND GADDGETS, WHICH ARE SIMPLE, TOY-LIKE CONTRAPTIONS THAT YOU CAN PLAY WITH.

THE GAME ENDS WHEN YOU COMPLETE YOUR ALLOTTED NUMBER OF TURNS, ALTHOUGH ADDITIONAL TURNS AND DIE ROLLS CAN BE EARNED DURING THE GAME BY COMPLETING THE "MUSHROOM CHALLENGES" THAT OCCUR RATHER OFTEN.  AFTER COMPLETING YOUR SESSION, YOUR REWARDS ARE SAVED, AND YOU CAN PLAY WITH YOUR MINI-GAMES AND GADDGETS IN PLAY MODE.

THERE ARE ALSO TWO ADDITIONAL MODES AVAILABLE, "PARTY LAND," WHERE YOU CAN PLAY SPECIAL DUEL MINI-GAMES WITH A FRIEND, AND "CHALLENGE LAND," WHERE YOU PLAY THROUGH SPECIAL MODES THAT TEST YOUR MINI-GAME SKILLS TO EARN COINS, WHICH CAN BE USED TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL UNLOCKABLES IN A SHOP.

FINALLY, THERE IS ALSO A FEATURE CALLED THE "BONUS BOARD."  YOU CAN PLAY WITH A BOARD THAT IS INCLUDED WITH THE GAME USING THE GBA.  THE GBA TAKES CARE OF DIE ROLLS, MINI-GAMES, AND END-OF-THE-GAME EVENTS.</desc>

IN THIS CASE, THE PRINCESS IS TRANSFORMED INTO A BALL AND LAUNCHED FROM A SUPER MARIO 64-STYLE CANNON, WHICH A PAIR OF GOOMBAS AIM DIRECTLY AT BOWSER'S CASTLE. MARIO IS ALSO TRANSFORMED INTO A BALL AND CHASES AFTER HER.

THERE ARE 5 LEVELS, EACH CONSISTING OF A SET OF PINBALL TABLES. EACH TABLE HAS SOME EXITS (INCLUDING THE ONE BELOW THE FLIPPERS) THAT MARIO CAN USE TO MOVE TO OTHER TABLES. ALSO, EACH ONE HOLDS A STAR, NORMALLY OBTAINED BY DEFEATING ALL ENEMIES ON THE TABLE. SOME EXITS REQUIRE THAT MARIO HAS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF STARS. TO GAIN ACCESS TO BOWSER'S CASTLE, MARIO MUST DEFEAT THE BOSSES OF THE FIRST 4 LEVELS, WHICH GIVES HIM STAR KEYS. THE GAME ALSO FEATURES A "TIME ATTACK" MODE, WHICH ALLOWS PLAYERS TO FIGHT ALREADY DEFEATED BOSSES AGAIN.</desc>

TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR FAVORITE CHARACTER AND FACE OFF AGAINST MANY OPPONENTS AS YOU MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE HEAD OF THE GP TO REACH THE ULTIMATE PRIZE, AN INCREDIBLY RARE BATTLE CHIP!

GAMEPLAY IS BASED AROUND THE MEGA MAN BATTLE NETWORK SERIES OF GAMES, IN THAT PLAYERS PURCHASE AND USE VARIOUS BATTLE CHIPS TO COMBAT THEIR OPPONENTS.  HOWEVER, UNLIKE THE MAIN GAMES, PLAYERS DO NOT HAVE DIRECT CONTROL OVER THEIR NET NAVI.  INSTEAD, PLAYERS PRE-SELECT THEIR BATTLE CHIPS, AND ONE OF THESE CHIPS ARE USED IN THE BATTLE AGAINST THE OPPONENT.  ONCE SELECTED, THE GAME AUTOMATICALLY PLAYS OUT THE BATTLE.

THERE IS ALSO A PROCESS CALLED 'SLOTTING IN', WHICH CAN BE PERFORMED BY PRESSING L OR R DURING BATTLE WHEN YOUR SLOT IN GAUGE IS FULL.  SLOTTING IN ALLOWS YOU TO USE AN ADDITIONAL BATTLE CHIP DURING GAMEPLAY TO ASSIST YOU.  IF SUCCESSFUL, THE CHIP WILL BE USED, AND AID YOU WITH HEALING, DEALING EXTRA DAMAGE, AND SO ON.</desc>

		<desc>MONSTER RANCHER ADVANCE IS A MONSTER RAISING SIM THAT ALLOWS PLAYERS TO RAISE AND CUSTOMIZE 440 MONSTER TYPES. THESE MONSTERS CAN THEN BE TESTED IN IN-GAME TOURNAMENTS, OR BATTLED AGAINST OTHER PLAYERS IN 2P MODE WITH THE GBA LINK CABLE. 

MONSTERS ARE CREATED IN THE GAME'S SHRINE THROUGH THE ENTRY OF LETTERS, NUMBERS AND PUNCTUATION SYMBOLS. PLAYERS BEGIN WITH THE ABILITY TO ENTER UP TO 4 CHARACTERS TO MAKE MONSTERS, AND CAN UNLOCK THE ABILITY TO USE UP TO 8 CHARACTERS THROUGH GAINING HIGHER TRAINER RANKS. DIFFERENT WORDS OR COMBINATIONS OF CHARACTERS CAN NOT ONLY MAKE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MONSTERS, BUT EACH MONSTER CAN HAVE VARYING ATTRIBUTES AND CHARACTERISTICS, MAKING EACH ONE UNIQUE.

PLAYERS THEN TRAIN THE MONSTERS BY CHOOSING  WHICH FOODS TO FEED, WHICH DRILLS TO DO TO RAISE ATTRIBUTES, WHAT TRAINING TO SEND THEM TO FOR NEW ATTACKS, AND WHAT ITEMS TO GIVE THEM. THE GAME STARTS WITH A MODEST AMOUNT OF MONEY WITH WHICH FOOD AND ITEMS CAN BE PURCHASED, MORE MONEY IS EARNED IN TOURNAMENTS. GAMEPLAY REVOLVES AROUND PLANNING TRAINING SESSIONS, ADDING NEW ATTACKS AND JUGGLING A BANK ACCOUNT, ALONG WITH ATTEMPTING TO WIN TOURNAMENTS. AS MONSTERS AGE, THEY CAN BE ADDED TO A COACHING STAFF TO HELP RAISE NEW MONSTERS TO BETTER ATTRIBUTES, OR THEY CAN BE COMBINED WITH OTHER MONSTERS TO MAKE STRONGER BABIES. MONSTERS DO NOT DIE IN THIS GAME, HOWEVER, THEY DO FACE AN ENFORCED RETIREMENT AGE.

THERE IS A FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD STORYLINE, WHERE SOME CHARACTERS FROM OLDER MONSTER RANCHER GAMES VISIT, AND NEW CHARACTERS ARE INTRODUCED. THE GAMEPLAY ITSELF, LIKE MOST OTHER MONSTER RANCHER GAMES, IS OPEN-ENDED AND HAS UNLIMITED REPLAY VALUE.

THE 2 PLAYER MODE, INVOLVING A LINK CABLE AND TWO COPIES OF THE GAME, ALLOWS PLAYERS TO TEST THE MONSTERS THEY HAVE RAISED AGAINST OTHER PLAYERS. THE 2P MODE ALSO ALLOWS PLAYERS TO TRADE ITEMS AND CASH WITH ONE ANOTHER, TO WAGER ITEMS OR CASH ON TOURNAMENTS, AND TRADE RAISED MONSTERS INTO EACH OTHERS' GAMES.</desc>

		<name>Monster! Bass Fishing</name>
		<desc>ALTHOUGH THE NAME IMPLIES YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH MONSTERS, MONSTER! BASS FISHING IS A NORMAL FISHING GAME WHERE YOU CAN CATCH A VARIETY OF FISH INCLUDING VARIOUS BASS, NORTHERN PIKE, CATFISH, AND MORE.  THE "MONSTER" PART IS THAT YOU GET BONUS POINTS FOR CATCHING MONSTER-SIZED FISH.

THE GAME IS PLAYED IN ONE OF TWO MODES, CHALLENGE OR FREE FISH.  IN FREE FISH, YOU CAN FISH IN ANY LOCATION THAT IS UNLOCKED FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.  IN CHALLENGE, YOU ARE COMPETING IN A TOURNAMENT AND WILL HAVE A TIME LIMIT AND A SPECIFIC LOCATION TO FISH AT.

WHEN YOU START AT A LOCATION IN EITHER MODE, YOU HAVE THE OPTION TO MOVE YOUR BOAT TO ANY PLACE ON THE MAP.  HOWEVER, THIS DOES TAKE TIME AND MAY NOT ALWAYS BE IN YOUR BEST INTEREST IN THE CHALLENGE MODE.  YOU CAN THEN EITHER START CASTING, OR YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR LURE FIRST.

CATCHING FISH IS REALLY JUST A MATTER OF USING A GOOD LURE AND TEMPTING MOVEMENTS.  WHEN A FISH STRIKES, YOU NEED TO KEEP ENOUGH PRESSURE ON THE LINE TO KEEP THE HOOK SET, OR THE FISH WILL GET AWAY.  IF YOU LET THE LINE GET TOO TIGHT, THE LINE WILL BREAK AND YOU'LL LOSE THE FISH THEN AS WELL.  NOW JUST REEL IT IN AND SEE WHAT YOU CAUGHT.

THE GUI SHOWS A NICE FISH FINDER THAT IS COLOR-CODED BY THE TYPE OF FISH THAT IS SEEN.  NOTE THAT THIS FINDER IS NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE.

STATISTICS FOR THE GAME ARE VERY NICE.  YOU CAN SEE A NICE PICTURE OF YOUR FISH THAT YOU CATCH ALONG WITH THE SIZE OF IT.  THE TOP 6 CAN THEN BE SAVED IN THE AQUARIUM FOR VIEWING AT ANY TIME.  YOUR TOURNAMENT SCORES WILL BE BASED ON WEIGHT OF FISH AND ANY MONSTER BONUSES (BONUSES FOR CATCHING ONE OF THE TOP 3 LARGEST FISH THAT ROUND).  WINNING THE TOURNAMENTS WILL UNLOCK NEW LOCATIONS AND LET YOU PROGRESS TO A NEW LOCATION FOR THE NEXT TOURNAMENT.  IT WILL ALSO GET YOU A NICE TROPHY.</desc>

		<name>Moorhen 3 : The Chicken Chase!</name>
		<desc>THIS REALLY COULDN'T BE ANY SIMPLER; MOORHEN FEATURES NO COMPLICATED GAMEPLAY WHATSOEVER. YOU JUST SHOOT THINGS. THE REAL SKILL THOUGH IS IN KNOWING JUST WHAT TO SHOOT AND WHEN TO SHOOT IT AND WHERE SOME TARGETS REAP SIZEABLE REWARDS OTHERS WILL DRAIN YOUR SCORE IN NO TIME AT ALL. ONE ADDITION TO VERSION THREE IS THE INTRODUCTION OF PROTECTED BIRDS FLYING AROUND WITH YOUR INTENDED TARGETS WHICH MEANS THAT SHOOTING NOW TAKES A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT THAN SIMPLY BLASTING INTO THE SKY. OTHER FEATURES REMAIN INTACT AND THERE ARE STILL ITEMS THAT NEED TO BE AVOIDED SUCH AS BALLOONS AND VARIOUS ANIMALS ON THE GROUND. AS USUAL THOUGH YOU'LL NEED TO EXPERIMENT TO FIND OUT JUST WHAT'S WORTH HITTING AND WHAT'S NOT.

ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF THE MOORHEN SERIES HAS BEEN THE HIDDEN BONUSES AND SECRETS BUT THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN WELL CONCEALED AND YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO DISCOVER THEM BY ACCIDENT RATHER THAN ACTUALLY WORK THEM OUT. I WON'T SPOIL SOME OF THE GOODIES WE'VE DISCOVERED IN THIS VERSION BUT MOORHUHN 2 FEATURED SPIDERS THAT COULD BE SPUN AROUND TREES AND THE FIRST EDITION HAD YOU SHAKING TREES THEN SHOOTING DOWN TEN LEAVES FOR A 100 POINT BONUS. FINALLY THE HI-SCORE CHART IS STILL THERE AS IS THE WONDERFUL BATTERY BACK UP SO YOU CAN PROVE THAT YOU DID ACTUALLY GET A SCORE OVER 50.</desc>

ADDITIONALLY, WITH THE POWER OF THE ONI GAUNTLET, HE CAN ABSORB THE SOULS OF ENEMIES AND USE THE DEMON GENMA STONES TO RECREATE LOST WEAPONS AND ARMOR. WITH THIS NEW KNOWLEDGE OF WHO HIS IS AND OF HIS DESTINY, HE ASSEMBLES A HASTY SQUAD OF FIGHTERS INCLUDING HIS SISTER ORORO AND SETS OFF TO AVENGE HIS PROVINCE AND STOP NOBUNAGA'S DEMONIC WAR UPON THE LAND.

1. PAC-MAN: THE ORIGINAL ARCADE CLASSIC, COMPLETE AND UN-CUT. 
2. PAC-MANIA: A CONVERSION OF THE 1987 UPDATE TO PAC-MAN, WHICH TAKES THE ELEMENTS OF THE ORIGINAL ARCADE GAME AND PUTS IT INTO AN ISOMETRIC VIEW, AS WELL AS ADDING THE ABILITY TO JUMP.
3. PAC-MAN ARRANGEMENT: NEVER RE-PRODUCED OUTSIDE OF THE ARCADE, ARRANGEMENT AGAIN USES THE ELEMENTS OF THE ORIGINAL PAC-MAN AND ADDS A FIFTH GHOST, WHO CAN CHANGE SHAPE AND SIZE WHEN COMBINED WITH THE OTHER 4 GHOSTS, AND MAKE LIFE HARDER FOR PAC-MAN. NEW POWER-UPS ARE ALSO INCLUDED, LIKE THE ABILITY TO DASH QUICKLY AROUND THE SCREEN, WARP POINTS TO GET FROM ONE PLACE TO THE OTHER AND NEW WAYS OF CATCHING GHOSTS.
PAC-ATTACK: LIKE TETRIS BEFORE IT, YOU MUST FIT FALLING BLOCKS TOGETHER TO COMPLETE A LINE TO CLEAR THE SCREEN. IN THIS CASE, THE FALLING TILES ALSO HAVE GHOSTS IN THEM, AND ONCE THE PAC-MAN TILE APPEARS (A TILE WITH THE PAC-MAN SYMBOL), PAC-MAN WILL EAT ALL OF THE GHOSTS THAT ARE IN HIS PATH UNTIL HE GETS TO A DEAD END.</desc>

HE MUST ALSO RUN, JUMP, AND SWIM HIS WAY PAST OTHER MALEVOLENT CREATURES, SUCH AS SKELETONS, SPIDERS, AND KILLER FISH. THANKFULLY, PAC-MAN HAS A VARIETY OF ATTACK METHODS. EXCLUDING GHOSTS, MOST BADDIES ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO PROJECTILE "PAC-DOTS," THE "ULTRA BUTT-BOUNCE" (WHICH ALSO HELPS HIM JUMP HIGHER), OR THE "REV ROLL," A SPEED BURST ALLOWING PAC-MAN TO MAKE LENGTHY JUMPS OFF RAMPS.

		<name>Penny Racers</name>
		<desc>SOMETIME IN THE 1980S, THE JAPANESE CHORO-Q RACING TOYS MADE THEIR WAY TO U.S. SHORES. RENAMED PENNY RACERS FOR THE BENEFIT OF AMERICAN SALES, THE WIND-UP CARS WERE BUILT TO PERFORM DIFFERENT TRICKS (WHEELIES AND SPINS, MOSTLY) WHEN A PENNY WAS INSERTED INTO THEIR CHASSIS. THE PLASTIC RACERS ARE STILL VERY POPULAR IN JAPAN, INSPIRING A VIDEO GAME CALLED CHORO-Q ADVANCE. THE U.S. RELEASE OF THE GAME IS CALLED GADGET RACERS, AND IT'S EVERY BIT AS EXCITING AS THE TOYS THAT IT'S BASED ON. COMMAND ANY OF 50 UNIQUE VEHICLES THROUGH 40 DIFFERENT COURSES OF OBSTACLES, TRICKS, AND GENERAL MAYHEM. YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE YOUR RACER TO MEET YOUR SPECIFICATIONS, USING MORE THAN 130 DIFFERENT PARTS TO SOUP THINGS UP UPGRADE YOUR TIRES, BRAKES, STEERING, ENGINES, AND MORE. ADDING TO THE EXCITEMENT IS THE FACT THAT YOU CAN GET FOUR PLAYERS COMPETING FOR GLORY VIA A LINK CABLE AND FOR GAME BOY ADVANCE CONSOLES. IT'S A MYSTERY WHY THE TOYS NO LONGER ROAM THE BEDROOM FLOORS OF AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS, BUT MAYBE THIS AWESOME VIDEO GAME WILL CREATE A RESURGENCE.</desc>

FROM PINOBEE'S FLUID ANIMATION TO THE DETAILED ENVIRONMENTS HE EXPLORES, IT'S OBVIOUS THAT A LOT OF SPIT AND POLISH HAS BEEN APPLIED TO THIS PAK. PINOBEE SCREENSHOTS MAY LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A STANDARD ACTION PLATFORM GAME, BUT THAT IS FAR FROM AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION. PINOBEE CAN WALK ALONG THE GROUND OR SHIMMY UP WALLS, BUT HIS MAIN MEANS OF LOCOMOTION IS DASHING THROUGH THE AIR. AS HE MAKES IT DEEPER IN HIS QUEST, PINOBEE GAINS THE ABILITY TO DASH FARTHER AND FARTHER THROUGH THE AIR. SOON ENOUGH, HE'S SPENDING MORE TIME HOVERING AND DASHING THROUGH THE SKY THAN ON THE GROUND. THIS UNIQUE PLAY CONTROL SYSTEM GIVES PINOBEE A FRESH FEEL.</desc>

		<name>Polarium Advance</name>
		<desc>POLARIUM ADVANCE IS BASICALLY THE SAME AS POLARIUM FOR THE NINTENDO DS, BUT A COUPLE OF NEW BLOCKS HAVE BEEN ADDED.

THIS IS A PUZZLE GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYER MUST CREATE HORIZONTAL LINES OF ALL THE SAME COLOR (EITHER BLACK OR WHITE). TO CHANGE THE COLOR (OR "POLARITY") OF A BLOCK, YOU MUST SELECT THE BLOCKS IN ONE LINE. IN MOST PUZZLES, YOU CAN USE THE BORDER TO LENGTHEN THE LINE. THE NEW BLOCKS IN THE ADVANCE VERSION ARE: HURDLE TILES, WHICH YOU CANNOT PASS, MULTI-TILES, WHICH COUNT AS BLACK OR WHITE, AND SOLID TILES, WHICH WILL NOT TURN BUT ARE REMOVED SO THAT THE TILES ABOVE THEM FALL DOWN. THERE ARE 365 PUZZLES IN THIS MODE (DAILY POLARIUM) RANGING FROM VERY EASY TO QUITE CHALLENGING.

THE TIME ATTACK MODE REQUIRES YOU TO SOLVE EITHER TEN EASY PUZZLES OR FIVE HARD PUZZLES WITHIN THE TIME GIVEN. LEAVING A BLOCK OF THE WRONG COLOR IN A LINE RESULTS IN A 30 SECONDS PENALTY. 

IT IS POSSIBLE TO CREATE YOUR OWN PUZZLES AND SHARE THEM WITH FRIENDS. PUZZLES CREATED IN THE NINTENDO DS VERSION OF THE GAME ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE GBA VERSION.</desc>

WITH EACH VEHICLE AND DRIVER PAIR YOU CAN RACE IN PRACTICE MODE TO FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH TRACKS OR CHOOSE A CHAMPIONSHIP MODE TO PROGRESS THROUGH A SERIES OF CIRCUITS. AFTER EACH RACE YOU'LL NEED TO SPEND SOME OF THE MONEY YOU'VE EARNED (EITHER BY PLACING OR PICKING UP MONEY ICONS DURING THE RACE) TO REPAIR AND -- IF POSSIBLE -- UPGRADE YOUR CAR. THE UPGRADES CAN IMPROVE YOUR CAR AS A RACING MACHINE (E.G. A LARGER ENGINE OR BETTER BRAKES) OR AS A WAR MACHINE (E.G. ADDING MORE WEAPONS BAYS OR BUYING A NEW TYPE OF WEAPON).

THE TRACK DESIGN USES THE ISOMETRIC VIEW, AND ALMOST NEVER PUTS THE CAR BEHIND AN OBSTACLE. HOWEVER, AMONG THE TWISTY ROADS ARE A FEW SHORTCUTS THAT REQUIRE YOU TO THINK OUTSIDE THE LINES OF THE ROAD, AND OCCASIONALLY TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH.</desc>

		<name>R-Type III : The Third Lightning</name>
		<desc>R-TYPE III WAS ORIGINALLY RELEASED ONLY ON THE SUPER FAMICOM/SNES, BUT LATER PORTED TO THE GAME BOY ADVANCE. IT WAS THE FIRST GAME IN THE SERIES TO INTRODUCE NEW FORCES. AS WELL AS THE ORIGINAL FORCE (WHICH WAS NOW NAMED THE ROUND FORCE, LATER NAMED AS THE STANDARD FORCE IN R-TYPE DELTA), THE PLAYER COULD CHOOSE FROM TWO OTHER FORCES: THE SHADOW FORCE AND THE CYCLONE FORCE. THESE BOTH HAD NEW, DIFFERENT WEAPON SETS AND SPECIAL ENHANCEMENTS.

IT ALSO REFINED THE WEAPONS AND CHARGING SYSTEM. IT REVERTED TO THE ORIGINAL RED-BLUE-YELLOW WEAPON SYSTEM, AND THE DIFFUSION WAVE CANNON FROM R-TYPE II WAS REPLACED WITH A MORE STANDARD WAVE CANNON. CHARGING THIS CANNON TO FULL BEAM STRENGTH RESULTS IN A MASSIVE, POWERFUL BEAM THAT PASSES THROUGH ALL ENEMIES AND OBSTACLES. A NEW WEAPON CALLED THE HYPER WAVE CANNON WAS ALSO ADDED TO THE SHIP, WHICH THE PLAYER COULD USE INSTEAD OF THE NORMAL WAVE CANNON IF DESIRED. BY SWITCHING TO HYPER MODE AND SUPERCHARGING THE WAVE CANNON, THE SHIP TEMPORARILY GAINS THE ABILITY TO USE THE HYPER WAVE CANNON, WHICH IS UNIQUE AMONG WAVE CANNONS IN HAVING A RAPID FIRE CAPABILITY. THE SHOTS FIRED CREATE DAMAGING EXPLOSIONS, AND IF THE PLAYER HAS COLLECTED ONE OR TWO BITS, THEY SPIN AROUND THE SHIP BURNING WITH ENERGY. HOWEVER, THIS HYPER MODE CAUSES THE SHIP TO OVERHEAT AFTER A SHORT WHILE, AND IT MUST SUBSEQUENTLY SPEND SECONDS COOLING DOWN, DURING WHICH TIME THE WAVE CANNON IS INOPERATIVE.

THE FIGHTER IN R-TYPE III IS IDENTIFIED IN R-TYPE FINAL AS THE R-9Ø RAGNARÖK; IT WAS ORIGINALLY REFERRED TO AS 'R-90'. IN FACT, THE ORIGINAL R-90 HAS BEEN SPLIT INTO THREE IN FINAL: THE R-9S STRIKE BOMBER HAS THE R-90'S BASIC STANDARD FORCE UNIT AND FIRST WAVE CANNON, IDENTIFIED AS MEGA WAVE CANNON. FINAL'S VERSION OF THE R-90 HAS THE SHADOW FORCE AND HYPER WAVE CANNON, BUT IS UNABLE TO CHOOSE ITS FORCE OR SWITCH BETWEEN WAVE CANNONS. FINALLY, THE R-9Ø2 RAGNAROK II HAS THE R-90'S FINAL FORCE, THE CYCLONE FORCE, AND THE GIGA WAVE CANNON, WHICH CAN BE CHARGED THROUGH 7 LOOPS. IT CAN BE ASSUMED THAT THIS IS BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL R-90 WOULD SIMPLY BE TOO POWERFUL FOR THE GAME TO BE ANY KIND OF CHALLENGE.</desc>

		<name>Shining Force : Resurrection of the Dark Dragon</name>
		<desc>SHINING FORCE IS A TURN-BASED TACTICAL RPG. BATTLES TAKE PLACE IN SQUARE GRIDS, AND EACH UNIT OCCUPIES ONE SQUARE. EACH UNIT CAN MOVE UP TO A FIXED AMOUNT OF SQUARES ALONG THE BATTLEFIELD, DETERMINED BY ITS MOVE STATISTIC. DEPENDING ON ITS LOCATION RELATIVE TO ENEMIES AND TO ALLIES, A UNIT CAN ALSO PERFORM ONE ACTION: ATTACK, CAST A SPELL, USE AN ITEM, OR SEARCH THE AREA. SOME COMMANDS, SUCH AS EQUIPPING OR DROPPING ITEMS, DON'T COUNT AS ACTIONS. THE ORDER OF TURNS IS DETERMINED BY THE UNIT'S AGILITY SCORE AND A RANDOM SEED.

IN SHINING FORCE, EACH ALLIED UNIT IS REPRESENTED BY A CHARACTER WITH HIS OR HER OWN BACKGROUND AND PERSONALITY, MUCH LIKE IN THE FIRE EMBLEM SERIES. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO "GENERIC" UNITS, EXCEPT ON THE ENEMY SIDE, MOST CHARACTERS CONTRIBUTE LITTLE OR NOTHING TO THE PLOT UPON JOINING THE PLAYER ARMY.

EACH ALLIED UNIT ALSO HAS A CLASS, WHICH DEFINES A SET OF ABILITIES FOR THAT UNIT AND DETERMINES THE SPELLS AND EQUIPMENT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO. A UNIT CAN BE PROMOTED TO ANOTHER CLASS AT ANY LEVEL BETWEEN 10 OR 20. UPON PROMOTION THE CHARACTER'S LEVEL RESETS TO 1 AND STATISTICS ARE REDUCED BY A FIXED AMOUNT, ALTHOUGH THEY BEGIN HIGHER IF THE CHARACTER HAD BEEN PROMOTED AT A HIGHER LEVEL.

BATTLE GOALS FOR THE PLAYER ARE FAIRLY SIMPLE: KILL ALL ENEMIES, KILL THE ENEMIES' LEADER, OR ADVANCE TO A TOWN OR LANDMARK. THE ENEMY SIDE WINS IF THEY KILL THE PLAYER'S LEADER, MAX, OR IF THE PLAYER CHOOSES TO ESCAPE THE BATTLE BY CASTING EGRESS. EVEN IF THE PLAYER ARMY IS DEFEATED, THE PLAYER CAN RECOVER ALLIES AND RETRY THE BATTLE. THE FORCE KEEPS ANY EXPERIENCE THAT IS OBTAINED, REGARDLESS OF THE BATTLE'S OUTCOME. THUS, THERE IS NO GAME OVER, AND THE PLAYER'S ARMY GETS STRONGER EVEN UPON ITS DEFEAT, ALTHOUGH MAX'S DEATH RESULTS IN THE PLAYER LOSING HALF OF THEIR MONEY.</desc>

		<name>Shining Soul II</name>
		<desc>THE DARK DRAGON WAS DEFEATED BY OUR HERO IN THE FIRST SHINING SOUL, AND THE PEOPLE REJOICED AS THE DARKNESS FADED AWAY.  PEOPLE ARE QUICK TO FORGET, HOWEVER.  AS TIME PASSED, PEOPLE'S LIVES IMPROVED AND THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE DARKNESS.  BUT AS THE LIGHT GREW MORE AND MORE POWERFUL, IT UPSET THE BALANCE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARK AND SOON DARKNESS WAS ON THE RISE ONCE AGAIN.

A PROPHET COMES AND WARNS THE PEOPLE OF THE IMPENDING DANGERS, BUT NO ONE LISTENS TO HIM.  ALTHOUGH HIS CRYSTAL SHOWS THE UPCOMING DANGERS, THE PEOPLE PASS BY WITHOUT ANY INTEREST.  AN AGENT OF THE DARKNESS, GILLESPIE, LURES THIS PROPHET OUTSIDE THE CITY AND KILLS HIM AND SHATTERS HIS CRYSTAL SO THE PEOPLE REMAIN IGNORANT OF WHAT IS COMING.

THIS SAME AGENT GIVES THE "FORBIDDEN FRUIT" TO DEATHARTE, THE TRUSTED ADVISER TO KING MARCEL IN KLANTOL CASTLE.  THE ADVISER DIDN'T TRUST GILLESPIE, BUT CURIOSITY IS A POWERFUL FORCE.

IT IS NOW UP TO ANOTHER HERO TO TAKE ON THE JOURNEY TO ONCE AGAIN STOP THIS GROWING DARKNESS.  AFTER CHOOSING YOUR CHARACTER FROM 8 POSSIBLE, YOU START OUT ON HIS OR HER WAY TO A TOURNAMENT BEING HELD AT KLANTOL CASTLE.  ON YOUR WAY, YOU MEET AN ADVENTURER WHO WILL EXPLAIN HOW TO BATTLE.  YOUR JOURNEY THEN TAKES YOU TO THE CASTLE TO START THE TOURNAMENT.

THIS TOURNAMENT IS INTERRUPTED WHEN THE KING FINDS OUT HIS DAUGHTER IS MISSING.  THE KING'S ADVISER HEADS OUT TO FIND HER, AND THE KING ASKS THAT YOU GO AS WELL.  IT IS HERE THAT YOUR STORY REALLY BEGINS.

THE GAMEPLAY IS SIMILAR TO MOST RPGS OF THIS TYPE WHERE THE MONSTERS ARE FOUGHT IN REAL-TIME.  AN INTERESTING PART OF THIS GAME IS THAT YOUR RESISTANCES WILL INCREASE WHEN USED.  OUTSIDE THE CASTLE, YOU CAN STAND ON A FIRE THAT WILL NOT DAMAGE YOUR HP, BUT AS YOUR RESISTANCE REACTS TO THE FIRE, IT WILL INCREASE SLOWLY.  TRAPS WILL ALSO INCREASE YOUR RESISTANCE IF YOU ARE HIT BY THEM, THOUGH YOU WILL ALSO BE HURT.  ONLY THE ONE FIRE IS SAFE.

TAKE ON MANY MONSTERS, CAST SPELLS, GET NEW EQUIPMENT.  BUT MOST OF ALL, SAVE THE WORLD FROM DARKNESS.</desc>

		<name>Snood</name>
		<desc>SNOOD IS A PUZZLE GAME BASED ON A SIMPLE IDEA, OF THE KIND THAT WAS COMMONPLACE IN THE LATE 1980S. THE GAME IS SET OUT WITH A GRID OF SMALL DIFFERENTLY-COLOURED SHAPES, EACH FEATURING FACES DRAWN ON THEM. A SUCCESSION OF BLOCKS ARE PLACED IN AN AIMING DEVICE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, AND YOU MUST ROTATE THIS SO AS TO AIM THEM, OFF THE WALLS IF NECESSARY, TO HIT ONES OF THE SAME COLOUR.

WHEN 3 OR MORE OF THE SAME COLOUR MAKE CONTACT, THEY ARE REMOVED FROM THE FIELD OF PLAY. ANY BLOCKS WHICH WERE ONLY CONNECTED TO THOSE BLOCKS (AND NOT TO ANY OTHERS OR THE CEILING) GET REMOVED FROM PLAY AS WELL. THIS IS CRUCIAL, BECAUSE EACH SHOT THAT FAILS TO DROP ANY BLOCKS OFF CAUSES A METER TO MOVE ON ONE LEVEL. WHEN THIS REACHES THE TOP, THE LINE OF BLOCKS DROPS BY ONE LEVEL. ONCE IT REACHES THE POINT WHERE BLOCKS ARE MOVED DOWN BELOW THE PLAYING AREA, IT IS GAME OVER.

THERE ARE FIVE SKILL LEVELS, AS WELL AS A SET OF 50 CHALLENGE LEVELS, AND A JOURNEY MODE IN WHICH YOU PLAY THROUGH ONE LEVEL FROM EACH DIFFICULTY. FROM MEDIUM DIFFICULTY UPWARDS, YOU'LL HAVE TO CONTEND WITH SKULLS AMONG THE LAYOUT - THESE CAN ONLY BE REMOVED BY BEING DROPPED AWAY.</desc>

SPACE INVADERS IS YET ANOTHER CLASSIC ARCADE GAME REMAKE BY ACTIVISION.  (SEE BATTLEZONE AND ASTEROIDS.)  BUT THIS TIME, ACTIVISION LICENSED A GAME FROM TAITO INSTEAD OF ATARI.  THE GAME STAYS CLOSE TO ITS ROOTS WHILE ADDING MANY POWER-UPS AND ENEMIES.

YOU CAN PLAY EITHER ONE OR TWO PLAYERS AGAINST THE INVADERS, WHO MARCH DOWN THE SCREEN IN ORDERLY ROWS AND COLUMNS, AT ONE OF THREE SKILL LEVELS.  YOU'LL START AT PLUTO AND WORK YOUR WAY THROUGH THE SOLAR SYSTEM TO MARS, THEN VENUS, AND FINALLY EARTH.  THERE ARE FOUR COMMON ALIENS (RED, GREEN, BLUE, AND YELLOW), PLUS SEVEN MORE LESS COMMON ONES.  YOU RECEIVE SPECIAL ONE SHOT POWER-UPS BY SHOOTING FOUR OF THE SAME TYPE OF INVADERS IN A ROW.  AS IN THE ORIGINAL GAME, THERE ARE ALSO MOTHER SHIPS THAT FLY ABOVE THE ACTION, BUT IN THIS VERSION IF YOU HIT THEM YOU CAN PICK UP OTHER USEFUL POWER-UPS LIKE SHIELDS OR DOUBLE SHOTS.  PLUS, AFTER FIGHTING OFF SEVERAL WAVES ON EACH PLANET, YOU'LL FACE A UNIQUE BOSS.  IF YOU MANAGE TO FINISH THE GAME, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PLAY A REPRODUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL COIN-OP.</desc>

DRIVING THE LIGHTNING-QUICK G-6155 INTERCEPTOR A VEHICLE THAT CAN SWITCH FROM CAR TO BOAT TO MOTORCYCLE YOU'LL TRY TO DESTROY THE N.O.S.T.R.A. ORGANIZATION BEFORE IT DESTROYS YOU.

THIS VERSION OF SPYHUNTER ACTUALLY SERVES AS SOMETHING OF AN UPDATE ON THE ORIGINAL, AS THERE ARE SEVEN REAL-WORLD LOCALES TO TEST YOUR RESOLVE, AND THE GAMEPLAY IS NOW MISSION BASED. THE GRAPHICS HAVE ALSO GOTTEN A BIT OF AN OVERHAUL, WITH VISUALS TAKING PLACE IN NEAR 3D.

COMBINING RACING WITH TRICKS, THE GAME ALLOWS PLAYERS TO CHOOSE FROM DIFFERENT EVENTS AND CHALLENGES AS THEY DESIRE. THE STORY MODE OF SSX 3 INVOLVES, LIKE THE PREVIOUS ENTRIES IN THE SERIES, BECOMING THE BEST SNOWBOARDER IN THE WORLD. PLAYERS HAVE A CAST OF CHARACTERS TO SELECT FROM, MOST OF WHOM HAVE APPEARED IN PREVIOUS SSX GAMES. ONCE PLAYERS HAVE SELECTED THEIR CHARACTER, THEY'RE OFF TO THE SLOPES TO START WINNING RACES AND PERFORMING HUGE TRICKS. THE MAIN MODE HAS 12 DIFFERENT EVENTS PLAYERS CAN PARTICIPATE IN. PLAYERS SELECT THE EVENT THEY WANT TO COMPETE IN FROM THE MAP. THERE ARE RACES, SUPER PIPE, BIG AIR, AND OTHER EVENTS, AND THERE'S SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE. WINNING THESE EVENTS NETS THE PLAYER CASH WHICH CAN BE USED TO UPGRADE THEIR EQUIPMENT. IN ADDITION TO WINNING THE RACE, PLAYERS WANT TO LOOK GOOD DOING IT, AND THAT'S WHERE THE TRICKS COME IN. PULL OFF ENOUGH OF THEM, AND THE PLAYER'S BOOST METER FILLS, REWARDING THEM WITH SOME EXTRA POWER. COMPLETE ENOUGH TRICKS AND THE CHARACTER LEARNS NEW, EVEN MORE DANGEROUS AND IMPRESSIVE TRICKS. GAMERS WHO LOVE SNOWBOARDING WILL ENJOY SSX 3. WHILE PLAYERS CAN'T EXPLORE AS FREELY AS THEY CAN IN THE CONSOLE VERSION OF THE GAME, THE RACING IS STILL INTENSE, AND THE MANY DIFFERENT GAME PLAY OPTIONS KEEP THE GAME FROM GETTING BORING OR REPETITIVE.</desc>

		<desc>SSX TRICKY IS EA'S FOLLOW UP TO SSX. TRICKY FEATURES FAR MORE STORYTELLING THAN THE ORIGINAL THROUGH THE USE OF PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES. RIVALRIES DEVELOP BETWEEN CHARACTERS WITH OPPOSING ATTRIBUTES, CAUSING THEM TO ACT MORE AGGRESSIVELY TOWARDS EACH OTHER DURING RACES. THE ÜBERTRICK SYSTEM ADDS A WHOLE NEW LAYER TO THE GAME. THESE TRICKS ARE MUCH TOUGHER TO PULL OFF, BUT GIVE YOU A NICE BOOST. PERFORMING SIX ÜBERTRICKS IN A ROW RESULTS IN A SUPER ÜBERTRICK, WHICH REWARDS YOU WITH A BIGGER BOOST AND CAUSES RUN DMC'S "IT'S TRICKY" TO PLAY. 

SEVEN TRACKS RETURN FROM THE ORIGINAL ACCOMPANIED BY BRAND-NEW GARIBALDI AND ALASKA TRACKS. THE RETURNING TRACKS CONTAIN UP TO FOUR TIMES AS MANY SHORTCUTS AND HIDDEN LINES. SIX OF THE EIGHT RIDERS FROM THE ORIGINAL RETURN (JURGEN AND HIRO SUFFERED OFF-SEASON INJURIES) AND ARE JOINED BY SIX NEW ONES. THE SOUNDTRACK WILL FEATURE MIXES BY MIX MASTER MIKE, APHRODITE, AND THE PLUMP DJS. DVD-LIKE BONUSES INCLUDE "BEHIND-THE-SCENES" FOOTAGE AND A "MAKING OF" SEGMENT.</desc>

		<desc>STADIUM GAMES IS A OLYMPIAD STYLE SPORTS GAME WHERE YOU CAN COMPETE IN THESE SIX EVENTS:

1. SHOOTING
2. ARCHERY
3. JAVELIN
4. FOOTBALL
5. POLE VAULT
6. HAMMER THROW

IN THE SHOOTING GAME, YOU HAVE TO SHOOT DOWN PAIRS OF CLAY PIGEONS THAT ARE SHOT IN FROM THE SIDE. YOU VIEW THE EVENT FROM A THIRD PERSON PERSPECTIVE, AND HAVE FULL CONTROL OF THE CROSS HAIR. THE REST OF THE EVENTS ARE DIFFERENT. THEY ALL USE TIMING METERS, ONE FOR STRENGTH AND ONE FOR ACCURACY, WHERE THE PLAYER HAS TO HIT THE BUTTON AT THE RIGHT SPOT ON THE METER. 

TWO GAME MODES ARE AVAILABLE. PRACTICE IS THE FIRST, WHERE ONE PLAYER CAN PLAY ANY OF THE EVENTS AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE REST. THE SECOND IS THE TOURNAMENT WHERE ONE OR TWO PLAYERS SHARING THE SAME MACHINE CAN GO THROUGH ALL THE EVENTS. FOR EACH EVENT THE PLAYER WILL EARN POINTS, AND THERE IS A HIGH SCORE TABLE FOR OVERALL SCORES.</desc>

		<desc>STREET FIGHTER ALPHA 3, THE THIRD GAME IN THE ALPHA SERIES, HAS A TOTAL OF 31 FIGHTERS, THE MOST IN THE SERIES SO FAR. NEW CHARACTERS INCLUDE OLD FAVORITES E. HONDA, BLANKA, VEGA, CAMMY, T. HAWK, DEE JAY, JUNI AND JULI. SOME OF THE NEWEST FIGHTERS ON THE BLOCK INCLUDE A FORMER FINAL FIGHT CHARACTER (CODY, WHO HAS BEEN IN JAIL SINCE THE LAST FINAL FIGHT GAME, OR SO HIS CLOTHING SUGGESTS), KARIN KANZUKI AND RAINBOW MIKA.

THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS ALPHA AND THE LAST TWO ARE THE NEW PLAY MODES WORLD TOUR, ARCADE, VS, TRAINING AND ENTRY. 

WORLD TOUR - SIMPLY CHOOSE YOUR FIGHTER AND TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD, FIGHTING THE HOME TOWN HEROES THAT YOU RUN INTO. THE MORE FIGHTS YOU WIN, THE STRONGER YOU FIGHTER BECOMES. YOU CAN ALSO LEARN NEW MOVES, AND THERE ARE THREE LEVELS OF SUPER MOVES TO CHOOSE FROM BEFORE YOU START EACH ROUND (CALLED ISMS).

ARCADE - A SIMPLE CONVERSION OF THE ARCADE VERSION. BEAT EACH FIGHTER WITH YOUR CHOSEN WARRIOR, IN THREE ROUNDS PER MATCH (MUCH THE SAME AS PAST VERSIONS OF STREET FIGHTER)

VERSUS - TWO HUMAN PLAYERS BATTLE IT OUT. 

TRAINING - A GOOD WAY TO LEARN ALL THE SUPER MOVES THAT ARE AVAILABLE, AGAINST A DUMMY.

ENTRY - IF YOU SAVE YOUR CHARACTER DURING THE WORLD TOUR MODE, YOU CAN UPLOAD HIM HERE TO USE IN THE OTHER MODES IN THE GAME (ESPECIALLY HANDY FOR TRAINING).

FINALLY, IF YOU COMPLETE CERTAIN AREAS OF THE GAME THREE NEW FIGHTERS BECOME AVAILABLE, INCLUDING ANOTHER OLD FAVOURITE IN GUILE, EVIL RYU AND SHIN AKUMA.</desc>

		<name>Super Bubble Pop</name>
		<desc>A COMBINATION OF TETRIS AND BUST-A-MOVE, SUPER BUBBLE POP HAS YOU CONTROLLING A CHARACTER ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE PLAYFIELD, WHO YOU USE TO THROW BUBBLES OF DIFFERENT COLOURS TOWARDS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLAYFIELD. AS YOU THROW THEM DOWN THE LINE, THEY WILL STACK UP IN PILES OF SIX. LINKING THREE BUBBLES TOGETHER WILL POP THEM (REMOVE THEM FROM THE FIELD), AND IF THERE IS A STACK OF SIX, THE BUBBLES ON THE WAY WILL FORM A NEW STACK IN FRONT OF IT.

THE AIM OF THE GAME IS TO REMOVE ALL BUBBLES FROM THE FIELD, BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY OF COMPLETING A GAME. TOKENS WILL APPEAR DURING PLAY, AND BY COLLECTING ENOUGH, YOU CAN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ROUND REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU HAVE ON THE PLAYFIELD.</desc>

		<desc>SUPER BUST-A-MOVE BRINGS WITH IT ALL OF THE ENTERTAINING PUZZLE ACTION OF THE SERIES WITH THE ADDITION OF NEW MULTIPLAYER MODES AND GRAPHICAL IMPROVEMENTS.

THE AIM OF THE GAME, AS WITH THE PREVIOUS TITLES IN THE SERIES, IS TO REMOVE A COLLECTED NUMBER OF COLOURED BUBBLES FROM THE GAME SCREEN. TO DO SO, AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, YOU AIM AND FIRE THE COLOURED BUBBLES FROM A LAUNCHER, SENDING THE BUBBLES UPWARDS INTO THE CONTAINER. MATCH THREE OR MORE TOGETHER OF THE SAME COLOUR TO CLEAR THEM FROM THE SCREEN. IF YOU'RE TOO SLOW, THE COLLECTION OF BUBBLES MOVES DOWN THE SCREEN TOWARDS YOU, AND THE GAME WILL END IF IT REACHES THE BOTTOM.

CLASSIC MODE FEATURES A NUMBER OF BUBBLE PUZZLES PREVIOUSLY SEEN IN THE BUST-A-MOVE SERIES, WHILE NORMAL MODE HAS SOME NEW VARIATIONS ON THE BUBBLE REMOVING THEME. TWO PLAYERS CAN ALSO COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER.</desc>

		<path>./Super Collapse! II (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Super Collapse! II</name>
		<desc>THE GAME CONCEPT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO ELIMINATE CLUSTERS OF AT LEAST 3 BLOCKS WITH YOUR MOUSE, BUT THE MORE YOU REMOVE AT ONCE, THE MORE YOU SCORE. ONCE THAT HAPPENS, ALL BLOCKS ABOVE THE ONES, WHICH HAVE VANISHED, WILL FALL DOWN AND CLOSE THE GAP.

BENEATH THE LOWEST ROW, THERE YOU SEE THE NEW ROW BUILDING UP. ONCE ALL BLOCKS ARE PRESENT, THIS ROW WILL BE NOW THE LOWEST ROW, WHILE ALL OTHERS ARE MOVING UP. ONCE ONE BLOCK REACHES THE TOP OF THE PLAYFIELD, YOU LOOSE.

EACH INDIVIDUAL LEVEL HAS A PRESET VALUE OF ROWS, WHICH WILL BUILD UP. TO WIN A LEVEL, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO, IS TO PREVENT THAT A FULL VERTICAL ROW (FROM BOTTOM TO TOP) GETS STACKED UP.

THE GAME OFFERS 4 GAME MODES: TRADITIONAL, PUZZLE, RELAPSE, AND STRATEGY. TWO OF THEM NEED A BRAIN, WHILE THE OTHER TWO JUST NEED A FAST HAND.

TRADITIONAL WORKS LIKE EXPLAINED ABOVE. NEW ROWS SHOW AUTOMATICALLY, WITH INCREASING SPEED NOT ONLY FROM LEVEL TO LEVEL, BUT ALSO IN A LEVEL. MEANS: THE LEVEL STARTS SLOW, BUT IN THE END, NEW ROWS WILL COMPLETE EVERY SECOND. POWER-UPS ARE AVAILABLE IN THIS GAME MODE.

RELAPSE WORKS EXACTLY LIKE TRADITIONAL, BUT WITH ONE MAJOR DIFFERENCE. THE ACTION ISN'T JUST LIMITED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PLAYFIELD, IN FACT, BOTH BOTTOM AND TOP NOW FILLING WITH BLOCKS. POWER-UPS USED ON ONE SIDE AFFECTING BOTH. HOW TO WIN IS THE SAME, BUT YOU LOOSE, WHEN BLOCKS FROM ONE SIDE TOUCHING THE OTHER.

STRATEGY IS ONE OF THE TWO GAME MODES WHERE YOU MUST THINK. CLICKING FAST WILL ONLY HELP TO SEE THE GAME OVER SCREEN. NEW ROWS WON'T APPEAR AUTOMATICALLY, INSTEAD FOR EACH CLUSTER YOU REMOVE, A FULL NEW LINE WILL APPEAR. SO YOU HAVE TO PLAN CAREFULLY BEFORE NEUTRALIZING A CLUSTER.

PUZZLE IS THE GAME MODE, WHERE NO NEW LINES APPEAR. ALSO THERE ARE NO POWER-UPS HERE. BUT THIS IS THE MOST COMPLEX GAME MODE. YOUR TASK IS TO COMPLETELY REMOVE ALL BLOCKS, IF AT LEAST ONE BLOCK IS STILL AVAILABLE, YOU LOOSE. THERE IS ALSO NO TIME LIMIT, SO YOU CAN THINK AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

THE FIRST THREE GAME MODES OFFERING BONUS LEVELS, WHICH WORKS LIKE THE PUZZLE MODE. SO, IF ONE BLOCK REMAINS, YOU ONLY SCORING THE NORMAL POINTS FOR REMOVED CLUSTERS. ONLY WHEN ALL BLOCKS ARE REMOVED, YOU SCORE THE BONUS POINTS. THERE ARE ONLY TWO DIFFERENCES: IT ISN'T SO COMPLEX, AND YOU ONLY HAVE 15 SECONDS TIME.

THERE ARE 5 DIFFERENT POWER-UPS IN THE GAME (2 GOOD, 2 BAD, 1 DEPENDING OF THE SITUATION): PLATFORM BLOCK (WON'T MOVE, JUST BLOCKING THE VERTICAL ROW WHERE IT IS), INDESTRUCTIBLE BLOCK (DOES MOVE LIKE A REGULAR BLOCK, BUT CAN'T REMOVED WITH NORMAL ACTIONS), COLOR BOMB (ONE OF EACH OF THE 5 COLORS, WILL DETONATE ALL SAME COLORED BLOCKS IN IT'S BIG RADIUS), SUPER BOMB (SHORTER RANGE THAN THE COLOR BOMB, BUT BLOW UP ALL BLOCKS, REGARDLESS THE COLOR; ONLY WAY TO REMOVE PLATFORM/INDESTRUCTIBLE BLOCKS), AND FINALLY, THE GRAVITY BLOCK (ONLY AVAILABLE IN RELAPSE MODE, WILL SHIFT ALL BLOCKS FROM THE SIDE WHERE IT WAS ACTIVATED TO THE OTHER SIDE).</desc>

		<desc>IT IS TWO HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE "SPACE ERA", A TIME PERIOD WHEN CIVILIZATION BEGAN EXPANDING INTO SPACE. HOWEVER, BY THE START OF THE 21ST CENTURY, TWO METEORS STRUCK AND DESTROYED MUCH OF THE EARTH, SENDING HUMANITY INTO CHAOS. BY YEAR 179 OF THE SPACE ERA, SECRET TECHNOLOGY, DUBBED EXTRA-OVER TECHNOLOGY, OR EOT, WAS DISCOVERED BY THE EARTH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITHIN A THIRD METEOR THAT HAD HIT EARTH AT THE MARQUESAS ISLANDS IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC. DR. BIAN ZOLDARK, WHILE INVESTIGATING THE METEOR, ALSO FOUND OUT THAT THE CREATORS OF THE EXTRA-OVER TECHNOLOGY WERE HEADING TO EARTH TO RECLAIM IT. IN ORDER TO DEFEND EARTH, THE GOVERNMENT STARTS TO DEVELOP A GROUP OF HUMANOID MECHA, KNOWN AS PERSONAL TROOPERS.
THE ALIEN RACE THAT CREATED EXTRA-OVER TECHNOLOGY, CALLED THE AEROGATERS BY THE EARTH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, INITIALLY ATTACKS AN EARTH SHIP SENT OUT TO INVESTIGATE THEIR PRESENCE IN THE FAR REACHES OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. THIS INITIAL SKIRMISH ENDS IN A DEFEAT FOR THE AEROGATERS, PROMPTING THEM TO SUE FOR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE EARTH FEDERATION ARMY. TALKS ARE ARRANGED TO TAKE PLACE AT A SECRET FACILITY IN ANTARCTICA, BUT THE TALKS ARE TARGETED BY A ROGUE FACTION CALLED THE DIVINE CRUSADERS.
THE DIVINE CRUSADERS DESTROYS THE AEROGATER DELEGATION, THEN TURN ON THE FEDERATION FORCES. BIAN ZOLDARK, REVEALING HIMSELF TO BE THE LEADER OF THE DIVINE CRUSADERS, ANNOUNCES THE EXISTENCE OF THE AEROGATERS TO THE WORLD AND REBEL AGAINST THE EARTH GOVERNMENT. AS EARTH SPINS INTO CIVIL WAR, A NEW AEROGATER FORCE IS ON THE MOVE, SEEKING TO RECLAIM THEIR LOST TECHNOLOGY...</desc>

		<desc>BASED ON THE LIVE ACTION FILM RELEASED IN 2004 (WHICH IN TURN WAS BASED ON THE 1960S SERIES STARRING MARIONETTES), THUNDERBIRDS STARS ALAN, TIN-TIN, AND FERMAT, THREE CHILDREN WHOSE GUARDIANS ARE PART OF THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE TEAM. THE PLAYER TAKES CONTROL OF ALL THREE CHILDREN AS THEY GO THROUGH TRAINING AND ARE THEN FORCED TO TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD TO SAVE MEMBERS OF INTERNATIONAL RESCUE FROM AN EVIL VILLAIN KNOWN AS THE HOOD.

THE GAME TAKES PLACE IN LOCALES SUCH AS THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE ISLAND, AFRICA, AND EVEN OUTER SPACE. EACH OF THE THREE CHARACTERS HAS HIS OR HER OWN UNIQUE ABILITIES THAT THE PLAYER MUST USE TO SOLVE PUZZLES AND ADVANCE THROUGH A LEVEL. ALAN HAS STRENGTH AND JUMPING ABILITY, TIN-TIN HAS TELEKINETIC POWERS THAT ARE USED TO MOVE OBJECTS, AND FERMAT CAN HACK COMPUTERS AND ROLL THROUGH HOLES. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF THE GAMEPLAY IS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF SOLVING PUZZLES FROM AN OVERHEAD VIEW, THERE ARE ALSO FLIGHT ACTION SEQUENCES WHERE THE PLAYER CAN FLY ONE OF THE MANY VEHICLES KNOWN AS THE THUNDERBIRDS.</desc>

		<desc>TIGER WOODS IS BACK FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF GOLF IN THE 2004 EDITION OF THE "BEST SELLING PRO GOLF SERIES".

THE BIGGEST ADDITION TO THIS VERSION IS EA'S GAME FACE, WHICH LETS YOU CUSTOMIZE EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING.  YOU HAVE THE BASICS, SUCH AS HAIR, SKIN, FACIAL HAIR AND OTHER GENERAL APPEARANCES, BUT GAME FACE ALLOWS YOU TO CUSTOMIZE EVERY OTHER ASPECT, FROM TEETH SHAPE, LOGOS, TATTOOS, HEADBANDS, HATS, AND MORE.  YOU MAY ALSO CHANGE INDIVIDUAL BODY MASS, MUSCLE TONE, MID-SECTION, ARMS AND LEGS.  YOU ALSO HAVE THE OPTION OF CHOOSING SPECIFIC SWING STYLE ANIMATIONS, POST-PUTT AND CELEBRATION ANIMATIONS, AND "PISSED OFF" ANIMATIONS FOR WHEN YOU SCORE A TRIPLE BOGEY.

ONE OF THE NEW MODES IS WORLD TOUR, WHICH PUTS YOU THROUGH A STANDARD 52-WEEK PGA TOUR TO EARN MONEY, SPONORSHIPS, AND BETTER GEAR.  YOU CAN PLAY FOR UP TO TWENTY SEASONS.  THE OTHER NEW GAME MODE IS BATTLE GOLF, WHERE YOU CAN WIN AN OPPONENT'S CLUBS IF YOU BEAT THEM.  ALL THE OTHER STANDARD GAME MODES ARE HERE, FROM SKILL CHALLENGE AND SPEED GOLF TO A SKINS MATCH OR PRACTICE.

A NEW FEATURE IS THE GAME'S ABILITY TO READ YOUR CONSOLE'S INTERNAL CLOCK, AND PROVIDE YOU WITH GAME MODES.  IF IT'S NEAR THE END OF OCTOBER AND YOUR CLOCK IS PROPERLY SET, YOU MAY BE INVITED TO A HALLOWEEN EVENT WHERE YOU CAN WIN ITEMS SPECIFIC TO THAT EVENT.

ALL TOP PGA PLAYERS ARE INCLUDED FOR YOU TO PLAY AS (OR AGAINST), INCLUDING VIJAY SINGH AND JUSTIN LEONARD.  NEWCOMERS TO THE SPORT HAVE ALSO BEEN ADDED, SUCH AS JOHN DALY.

MOST OF THE COURSES FROM 2003 HAVE MADE IT, WITH SEVEN NEW COURSES, BOTH REAL AND FANTASY.  ONE OF THE NEW COURSES IS BETHPAGE BLACK, AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT COURSE LOCATED IN WASHINGTON.

LIKE ALL OTHER 2004 EA SPORTS CONSOLE GAMES, TIGER WOODS PGA TOUR 2004 HAS THE EA SPORTS BIO, WHICH TRACKS YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND GAMES OVER ALL EA SPORTS TITLES.  THE MORE EA SPORTS GAMES YOU PLAY, AND THE LONGER YOU PLAY THEM, WILL INCREASE YOUR EA GAMER LEVEL AND UNLOCK ADDITIONAL REWARDS, SUCH AS A NEW DRIVER IN TIGER WOODS OR HISTORIC TEAMS IN NHL 2004.  THIS FEATURE ISN'T ON THE PC VERSION.

GAMERS WHO BUY THE PLAYSTATION 2 VERSION WILL BE ABLE TO PLAY ONLINE THROUGH EA'S MATCHMAKING SERVICE.  YOU CANNOT PLAY ONLINE WITH THE XBOX OR GAMECUBE VERSIONS.

IF YOU BUY THE GAMECUBE VERSION, YOU CAN USE THE GAMEBOY ADVANCE TO HOOK UP TO THE GAMECUBE TO UNLOCK SPECIAL REWARDS NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH NORMAL PLAY.</desc>

		<desc>COWABUNGA! TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR FAVOURITE TURTLE NINJAS AS YOU PLAY THROUGH THE EVENTS OF THE 2007 CGI MOVIE. THE TURTLES HAVE GROWN APART, AND RAPHAEL HAS TAKEN TO CRIME FIGHTING SOLO UNDER THE GUISE OF THE NIGHTWATCHER.  THE FOOT CLAN ARE TURNING UP IN THE STREETS AGAIN, AND A MYSTERIOUS MAN KNOWN AS WINTERS SEEMS TO BE INVOLVED WITH THEM. ONLY THE NINJA TURTLES CAN CLEAN UP THE STREETS!

THE GAME BOY ADVANCE VERSION OF TMNT CAN BE BEST DESCRIBED AS SIMILAR TO THE NES GAME RIVER CITY RANSOM.  PLAYERS TAKE CONTROL OF EITHER A SPECIFIC TURTLE OR THE TURTLE OF THEIR CHOICE (DEPENDING ON THE MISSION), AND FIGHT THROUGH WAVES OF ENEMIES IN A SIDESCROLLING BEAT-EM-UP STYLE.  ENEMIES WILL DROP THE USUAL HEALTH PICKUPS, BUT ALSO DROP MONEY AND WEAPONRY.  MONEY CAN BE USED TO PURCHASE WEAPONS OR UPGRADES BETWEEN MISSIONS, WHILE WEAPONS CAN BE USED AS A MORE POWERFUL TOOL TO DEFEAT YOUR FOES (HOWEVER, THESE WEAPONS HAVE A LIMITED USE).  AFTER THE COMPLETION OF A MISSION, EXPERIENCE IS EARNED, AND AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE IS GAINED, YOU CAN LEVEL UP THE TURTLES TO IMPROVE THEIR FIGHTING STATISTICS.

EACH TURTLE HAS THEIR OWN SPECIFIC WEAPON: LEONARDO WITH HIS DUAL KATANA, MICHELANGELO WITH HIS NUNCHUCKS, DONATELLO WITH HIS BO STAFF AND RAPHAEL WITH HIS TWO SAI.  THESE WEAPONS ARE USED IN THEIR STANDARD ATTACKS.  A BASIC ATTACK IS PERFORMED WITH THE B BUTTON, BUT YOU CAN PERFORM DIFFERENT ATTACKS WITH B AND OTHER BUTTONS SUCH AS THE DIRECTIONS OF THE CONTROL PAD AND THE A BUTTON.  UPPERCUTS, SWEEP KICKS, JUMP KICKS AND MORE CAN BE PERFORMED, AND YOU CAN EVEN JUGGLE ENEMIES IN THE AIR TO GET MORE HITS IN AND INCREASE YOUR SCORE.</desc>

		<desc>THE TONY HAWK SKATEBOARDING SERIES MAKES ITS DEBUT ON THE GAME BOY ADVANCE WITH THIS ADAPTATION OF THE SECOND PRO SKATER GAME.

GAMEPLAY IS SIMILAR TO THE ORIGINAL CONSOLE GAME. THE LEVELS HAVE BEEN ADAPTED FROM THE CONSOLE VERSION FOR THE TWO DIMENSIONAL ISOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE; ONE IS EVEN TAKEN FROM THE ORIGINAL TONY HAWK'S PRO SKATER.

IN CAREER MODE, CHOOSE FROM ONE OF 13 PROFESSIONAL SKATERS AND, IN EACH LEVEL, COMPLETE VARIOUS GOALS LIKE COLLECTING ITEMS, PERFORMING SPECIAL TRICKS AND OF COURSE BREAKING HIGH SCORES BY PERFORMING TRICKS AND COMBOS. COMPLETING THE GOALS EARNS MONEY WHICH UNLOCKS NEW LEVELS AND CAN BE SPENT ON NEW BOARDS, TRICKS AND UPGRADING YOUR SKATER'S STATS. IN COMPETITION LEVELS, YOU DON'T SKATE FOR MONEY BUT COMPETE FOR A MEDAL.

IN THE FREE SKATE AND SINGLE SESSION MODES, UNLOCKED LEVELS CAN BE PRACTICED AND NEW HIGH SCORES BE ESTABLISHED.</desc>

		<name>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4</name>
		<desc>THPS4 IS THE FOURTH GAME IN ACTIVISION'S EVER POPULAR FRANCHISE.

THE MAIN FEATURE OF THIS GAME IS IT'S REDESIGNED CAREER MODE.  WHEN BEGINNING A LEVEL, YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD TO SKATE AROUND, PERFORM TRICKS, GET A FEEL FOR THE LEVEL, WITHOUT THE HASSEL OF ANY GOALS OR TIME LIMITS.  WHEN YOU'RE READY TO ATTEMPT A GOAL, SIMPLY FIND A PRO SKATER, TALK TO HIM, THEN RECEIVE THE GOAL, SIMILAR TO DAVE MIRRA FREESTYLE BMX.  GOALS ARE SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS GAMES, SUCH AS COLLECT SKATE, GET A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF POINTS, TRANSFER OVER THIS AND GRIND THAT.  THERE ARE NEW GOALS, HOWEVER, SUCH AS COLLECTING THE WORD COMBO WHILE DOING ONE BIG COMBO.  MISS A TRICK, AND GOAL FAILS.  ONCE ALL REGULAR GOALS ARE ACCOMPLISHED, YOU CAN ATTEMPT THE PRO GOAL, WHICH IS SPECIFIC TO EACH SKATER, AND IS EXTREMELY HARD.

ALL THE MAJOR SKATERS ARE HERE, INCLUDING TONY HAWK, BOB BURNQUIST, STEVE CABALLERO, KAREEM CAMPBELL, RUNE GILFBERG, ERIC KOSTON, BUCKY LASEK, BAM MARGERA, RODNEY MULLEN, CHAD MUSKA, ANDREW REYNOLDS, GEOFF ROWLEY, ELISSA STEAMER AND JAMIE THOMAS.

THE LEVELS ARE BEEN EXPANDED AND ARE HUGE.  SOME OF THE LEVELS INCLUDE A COLLEGE CAMPUS, A SHIPYARD, AND THE INFAMOUS PRISON COMPLEX ALCATRAZ.

FOR MULTIPLAYER, ALL THE FAVORITE MODES ARE BACK, FROM GRAFFITI AND TRICK ATTACK TO HORSE AND KING OF THE HILL.  NEW MODES INCLUDE CAPTURE THE FLAG AND COMBO MAMBO.  THPS4 ALSO SUPPORTS SYSTEM LINK PLAY, BUT NOT XBOX LIVE.

THE PLAYSTATION 2 VERSION OFFERS EVERYTHING FROM THE XBOX VERSION, BUT ALSO HAS ONLINE PLAY, UTILIZING EITHER YOUR OWN NETWORK ADAPTOR OR THE OFFICIAL ONE.  THE PS2 VERSION ALSO FEATURES A ONE LEVEL DEMO OF SHAUN MURRAY'S PRO WAKEBOARDER, WHICH IS NOT FEATURED ON ANY OTHER VERSION OF THE GAME.</desc>

CHANGES IN THIS ITERATION INCLUDE REMOVING THE TIMER FROM MOST GOALS IN STORY MODE, ALLOWING YOU TO HAVE SEVERAL ACTIVE AT ONCE AND NEW MOVES LIKE THE NATA SPIN, TANTRUM, WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO RECOVER FROM A BAIL WITHOUT LOSING EVERYTHING, FOCUS, WHERE YOU CAN SLOW TIME IN ORDER TO LAND THE BEST TRICK AND STICKER-SLAPPING.</desc>

TRICK STAR IS A FUTURISTIC RACING GAME WHERE THE RACERS RIDE SLICK ONE-WHEELED BIKES. PLAYERS RACE ALONG THE TRACK, WITH THE GOAL OF NOT ONLY COMING FIRST, BUT ALSO PERFORMING STUNTS TO IMPRESS THE CROWDS. STUNTS CANNOT BE PERFORMED UNTIL A CERTAIN SPEED IS REACHED, AND THE "TRICK STAR" APPEARS ON THE HUD. WHEN IT APPEARS, PLAYERS CAN PERFORM A STUNT BY HOLDING L OR R, AS WELL AS ANY DIRECTION ON THE CONTROL PAD. PERFORMING STUNTS ALSO FILLS YOUR BOOST METER - WHEN IT IS FULL, YOU CAN PRESS L AND R SIMULTANEOUSLY TO GET AN EXTRA BOOST.

IN LEAGUE MODE, PLAYERS MUST COMPLETE THREE TRACKS, AS WELL AS SCORING ENOUGH POINTS TO QUALIFY FOR THE CHALLENGE MODE. ONCE THE PLAYER HAS ENOUGH POINTS, THEY CAN ENTER CHALLENGE MODE, WHERE THEY ARE ASKED TO PERFORM A PARTICULAR SET OF STUNTS IN BETWEEN MARKERS. WHEN THEY SUCCEED, THEY ARE REWARDED WITH ADDITIONAL STUNTS AND PROGRESS TO THE NEXT SET OF TRACKS.

TRICK STAR ALSO INCLUDES ONE PLAYER AT A TIME MULTIPLAYER, FOR UP TO FOUR PLAYERS. PLAYERS CAN COMPETE IN TIME TRIAL (AIM FOR THE FASTEST TIME), STUNTS (GET THE HIGHEST STUNT POINT SCORE), LONG JUMP (JUMP THE LONGEST DISTANCE ALONG THE TRACK) AND CHALLENGES (COMPLETE THE REQUIRED CHALLENGES). AFTER EACH PLAYER HAS HAD A GO, THE RESULTS ARE SHOWN.</desc>

		<name>Whac-A-Mole</name>
		<desc>THIS IS AN ADAPTION OF THE ARCADE GAME WHAC-A-MOLE, FOR NINTENDO'S HANDHELD DEVICES. AT THE SCREEN YOU HAVE A 5X4 GRID OF HOLES (3X3 IN THE GBA VERSION). AS THE GAME BEGINS, MOLES WILL RANDOMLY POP UP THEIR HEADS IN THE HOLES. NOW YOU HAVE TO HIT THEM BEFORE THEY DISAPPEAR AGAIN. DS USERS WILL USE THE STYLUS AND TAP THE MOLES, WHILE GBA USERS WILL HAVE TO USE THE DIRECTIONAL PAD TO MOVE A MARKER AROUND THE SCREEN.

THE GAME COMES WITH THREE DIFFERENT GAME MODES. THE FIRST IS THE ARCADE MODE, WERE YOU FOR EACH LEVEL HAS TO REACH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF POINTS BEFORE THE TIME GOES OUT. DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOLE WILL SHOW UP. IN ADDITION TO THE STANDARD MOLE, THERE'S THE GOLDEN MOLE WHICH GIVES FOUR TIMES AS MUCH POINTS AS THE STANDARD ONE, AND THE PLUSH ONE WHICH GIVES MINUS POINTS. LATER IN THE GAME, YOU WILL ALSO MEET MOLES THAT ATTACK YOUR SCORE, FOR EXAMPLE NINJA AND BAZOOKA MOLES. VARIOUS POWER UPS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE. WE HAVE THE MULTIPLIERS, WHICH  ONCE ACTIVE WILL GIVE YOU DOUBLE POINTS FOR EACH MOLE, CLOCKS THAT SLOWS THE TIME AND BOMBS THAT DO THE OPPOSITE. SEVEN WORLDS ARE AVAILABLE, EACH WITH IT'S OWN GRAPHICAL THEME.

THE SECOND MODE IS THE PUZZLE MODE, WHICH ISN'T THE SAME ON BOTH PLATFORMS. IN THE DS VERSION YOU HAVE TO RECREATE A SHAPE THAT IS SHOWN ON THE UPPER SCREEN. THIS IS DONE BY TAPPING MOLES OF DIFFERENT COLORS. THE GBA VERSION HAS TWO PUZZLE GAMES. ONE IS A TIC TAC TOE WHERE YOU HAVE TO HIT THREE MOLES IN A ROW BEFORE YOUR OPPONENT DOES SO. THE OTHER IS THE PEG PUZZLE WHERE YOU HAVE TO EMPTY THE FIELD FROM ALL MOLES. FOR EACH MOLE YOU REMOVE, MORE MOLES WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN. THE MOLES WILL HAVE ARROWS AROUND THEM, INDICATING WHERE THE NEW MOLES WILL POP UP. HOWEVER, THERE WON'T COME ANY NEW MOLES IF THERE ALREADY IS A MOLE IN THAT LOCATION.

THE THIRD MODE IS A SIMPLE QUICK PLAY MODE WHERE YOU JUST SPECIFY HOW MANY LEVELS YOU WANT TO PLAY AND WITH WHAT DIFFICULTY AND THEN TRY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THE DS VERSION ALSO SUPPORTS A MULTIPLAYER MODE.</desc>

		<desc>WINX CLUB IS AN ACTION ADVENTURE GAME BASED ON THE ITALIAN CARTOON SERIES OF THE SAME NAME. THE STORY IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF HARRY POTTER, ONLY THIS TIME THE MAIN CHARACTER IS A FAIRY. SHE GETS TO GO TO A FAIRY SCHOOL IN FAIRYTALE WORLD CALLED MAGIX WHERE SHE HAS TO FIND HER TRUE SELF. THIS GAME IS SIMILAR TO THE WINDOWS AND PLAYSTATION 2 VERSIONS, EXCEPT THAT INSTEAD OF A 3D THIRD PERSON PERSPECTIVE IT FEATURES A 2D TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE OF THE GAME WORLD.

THIS GAME LOOSELY RETELLS THE STORY OF THE FIRST SEASON OF THE TELEVISION SERIES.

THERE ARE "ACTION" AND "ADVENTURE"LEVELS. IN THE ADVENTURE LEVELS GAMEPLAY CONSISTS OF FINDING ITEMS FOR SPECIFIC NPCS AND PLAYING VARIOUS MINI-GAMES. IN THE ACTION LEVELS THE PLAYER HAS TO JUMP, CLIMB AND FIGHT ENEMIES. THE MAIN CHARACTER, BLOOM, HAS A MAGIC SHIELD AND TWO ATTACKS THAT IMPROVE DURING THE GAME. SHE CAN ALSO CAST A NUMBER OF SPELLS THAT CAN AID HER IN FINDING THE ITEMS SHE NEEDS. DURING BOSS BATTLES BLOOM CHANGES TO HER WINX FORM IN WHICH SHE IS MORE POWERFUL AND CAN FLY. DURING THE LEVELS THERE ARE VARIOUS ITEMS TO BE PICKED UP WHICH IMPROVE BLOOMS HEALTH OR ATTACKS OR UNLOCK NEW OUTFITS THAT CAN BE WORN.</desc>

		<path>./Wolfenstein 3D (USA, Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Wolfenstein 3D</name>
		<desc>INSPIRED BY THE TOP-DOWN INFILTRATION GAME CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN, THIS EPISODIC FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER (FPS) PUTS THE PLAYER IN THE BOOTS OF  B.J. BLAZKOWICZ, AN ALLIED SPY. THERE ARE SIX EPISODES (THE FIRST DISTRIBUTED COMPLETE AS SHAREWARE), THE SECOND, AND THE THIRD AVAILABLE AFTER REGISTRATION AND THE THREE FINAL MISSIONS (WHICH HAPPEN BEFORE THE EVENTS OF THE FIRST EPISODE) AVAILABLE IN THE "NOCTURNAL MISSIONS" PACK. HOWEVER, THEY DO NOT NEED TO BE PLAYED IN SEQUENCE TO BE ENJOYED!

IN THE FIRST EPISODE (ESCAPE FROM WOLFENSTEIN), B.J. WAS CAPTURED, BUT OVERPOWERED A GUARD WITH THE HELP OF A CONCEALED KNIFE AND MANAGED TO GET OUT OF HIS CELL. THROUGHOUT THE NEXT NINE LEVELS THE PLAYER GUIDES B.J. SEARCHING FOR AN ESCAPE FROM WOLFENSTEIN, GUARDED BY HANS GROSSE. AFTER RETURNING TO ALLIED TERRITORY, B.J. IS GIVEN THE INSTRUCTIONS TO OPERATION: EISENFAUST, WHERE HE HAS TO STOP DR. SCHABBS AND HIS ARMY OF MUTANT PROTOTYPES BEFORE THEY ARE RELEASED INTO THE BATTLEFIELDS. THE FINAL MISSION (DIE, FÜHRER, DIE!) HAS A SIMPLE GOAL: INFILTRATE THE BUNKER UNDER THE REICHSTAG, AND TERMINATE HITLER (IN A ROBOTIC SUIT) HIMSELF. THE NOCTURNAL MISSIONS ARE FOCUSED ON THE NAZI PLANS FOR CHEMICAL WARFARE, AND START WITH DARK SECRET, WHERE B.J. HUNTS FOR LEAD RESEARCHER DR. OTTO GIFTMACHER. IT'S FOLLOWED BY TRAIL OF THE MADMAN, WHERE THE GOAL IS CAPTURING THE WAR PLANS GUARDED BY GRETEL GROSSE, AND THE FINAL EPISODE CONFRONTATION, WHERE B.J. MEETS GENERAL FETTGESICHT, THE PLANNER FOR THE CHEMICAL ASSAULT.

EACH EPISODE HAS NINE LEVELS (EIGHT REGULAR AND A FINAL BOSS LEVEL), PLUS A SECRET LEVEL ACTIVATED BY AN HIDDEN SWITCH SOMEWHERE IN THE EIGHT FIRST LEVELS. REGULAR LEVELS OFTEN FEATURE A MAZE-LIKE APPEARANCE OR LARGE AREAS WITH MANY ENEMIES (THE NUMBER OF THEM ON EACH AREA DEPENDS ON THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL), WHERE THE PLAYER MUST REACH THE EXIT ELEVATOR. TO DO SO, HE MUST KILL THE ENEMIES (WHILE IT'S POSSIBLE TO MOVE BEHIND THE GUARDS' BACKS AND EVEN THERE'S A SLIGHT BONUS IN ATTACKING THEM FROM BEHIND, MOST ENEMIES HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH BY FIRE POWER), AND DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL, ACTIVATE "PUSH WALLS" AND/OR GET SILVER AND GOLDEN KEYS TO OPEN CERTAIN DOORS.

MANY OBJECTS CAN BE FOUND IN A LEVEL, FROM MEDIKITS, CHICKEN MEALS, AND EVEN DOG FOOD (TO RESTORE HEALTH), AMMO AND TREASURES, WHICH SOLELY EXIST FOR POINTS. THERE ARE FOUR WEAPONS (KNIFE, PISTOL, MACHINE GUN AND GATLING), ALL OF THEM USING THE SAME BULLETS EXCEPT THE KNIFE. THE KNIFE AND THE PISTOL ARE GIVEN AT THE START OF THE LEVEL, WHILE THE MACHINE GUN IS EITHER FOUND (USUALLY IN SECRET AREAS) OR PICKED UP FROM SS TROOPERS AND THE GATLING IS ALWAYS DROPPED SOMEWHERE IN THE LEVEL. THERE ARE FIVE KINDS OF ENEMIES (EXCLUDING BOSSES) - DOGS (FAST, BUT MORE A NUISANCE THAN LIFE-THREATENING), ARMY SOLDIERS (DRESSED IN REGULAR BROWN OUTFIT, NOT VERY POWERFUL BUT USUALLY FOUND IN LARGE GROUPS), OFFICERS (DRESSED IN WHITE, ARMED WITH A VERY ACCURATE PISTOL AND TOUGH TO KILL), SS TROOPERS (BLUE ATTIRE, ARMED WITH A MACHINE GUN AND TOUGH TO KILL), AND MUTANTS (THE RAREST AND TOUGHEST OF REGULAR ENEMIES, PALE-SKINNED TROOPERS WITH GREEN CLOTHES AND A MACHINE GUN STUCK IN THEIR CHEST).

UNLIKE MODERN FPS GAMES, THE PLAYER HAS A NUMBER OF LIVES AND ONCE THE PLAYER LOSES THE LAST LIFE, THE GAME ENDS. TO WIN EXTRA LIVES, THE PLAYER HAS TO EITHER FIND THE 1-UP ITEM IN THE LEVEL OR GET 20,000 POINTS (BY KILLING ENEMIES AND CAPTURING TREASURES OR COMPLETING A LEVEL BELOW THE 'PAR' TIME WHILE KILLING ALL ENEMIES, FINDING ALL SECRETS BY PUSHING WALLS, AND COLLECTING ALL TREASURE POINTS).</desc>

		<name>Worms Blast</name>
		<desc>THE GAMEPLAY IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF PUZZLE BOBBLE/BUST-A-MOVE, BUT WITH SEVERAL KEY DIFFERENCES. THERE IS A HEXAGONAL GRID OF COLOURED BLOCKS AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN, WHILE THE PLAYER'S CHARACTER SITS ON A BOAT FLOATING IN WATER. UNLIKE PUZZLE BOBBLE, IT IS ABLE TO MOVE SIDE TO SIDE. THERE ARE MULTIPLE WEAPONS THAT CAN BE USED, HOWEVER THE ONLY WEAPON THE PLAYER HAS TO START WITH IS A BAZOOKA. AS WITH WORMS, HOLDING DOWN THE FIRE BUTTON INCREASES THE POWER BEHIND THE WEAPON'S LAUNCH, AFFECTING HOW FAR IT WILL TRAVEL. IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIRE THE BAZOOKA (AND SOME OTHER WEAPONS, SUCH AS THE GRENADE AND DYNAMITE) IN AN "ARCH", ALLOWING PLAYERS TO REACH DIFFICULT AREAS.

SHOOTING BLOCKS WILL HAVE ONE OF TWO EFFECTS:

IF YOU HIT A BLOCK THAT IS EITHER THE SAME COLOUR AS YOUR BAZOOKA MISSILE, OR IS A RAINBOW BLOCK, THAT BLOCK AND ANY OTHER SAME-COLOURED OR RAINBOW BLOCKS CONNECTED TO IT WILL BE DESTROYED. ANY BLOCKS THAT ARE NOT THE SAME COLOUR WILL NOT BE AFFECTED; HOWEVER, IF THE ONLY THING HOLDING THOSE BLOCKS UP IS THE COLOURED BLOCKS YOU HAVE JUST DESTROYED, THOSE BLOCKS WILL FALL INTO THE WATER.

IF YOU HIT A BLOCK THAT IS A DIFFERENT COLOUR FROM YOUR BAZOOKA MISSILE, OR IS A "DEAD BLOCK" - AN UNCOLOURED, GREY BLOCK - IT WILL BE RECOLOURED TO MATCH THE MISSILE.

(WEAPONS ARE AFFECTED DIFFERENTLY BY OTHER BLOCKS. THIS IS COVERED FURTHER BELOW.)</desc>
