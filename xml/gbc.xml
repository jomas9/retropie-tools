		<desc>BEING THE PREDECESSOR OF ASTERIX AND OBELIX FOR SNES, THIS GAME FEATURES THE SAME STORY AS IT'S LATER COUNTERPART - HOWEVER THE LEVEL DESIGN WAS MASSIVELY CHANGED, DOESN'T OFFER A 2 PLAYER MODE AND LEVEL CODES WERE ADDED ONLY FOR THE GAMEBOY COLOR VERSION.

TO SHOW CAESAR THE POWER AND FREEDOM OF YOUR VILLAGE, YOU HAVE TO COLLECT VARIOUS TROPHIES FROM ALL OVER EUROPE. TO DO THIS, YOU CAN SELECT ASTERIX OR OBELIX AND MOVE THEM THROUGH VARIOUS LEVELS WHILE BEATING UP ROMAN SOLDIERS, COLLECTING COINS AND AVOIDING GAPS OR OTHER OBSTACLES. VARIOUS SPECIAL LEVELS LIKE CROSSING THE SEA TO GREAT BRITAIN BY BOAT (AND BEATING UP SOME ROMANS AGAIN) OR FREEING RUGBY PLAYERS CAPTURED BY THE ROMANS ARE SCATTERED ACROSS THE GAME AND PROVIDE VARIETY BETWEEN THE CLASSICAL JUMP 'N RUN LEVELS. MOST LEVELS ADDITIONALLY HAVE A TIME LIMIT TO MAKE THINGS A BIT HARDER, THOUGH THE DIFFICULTY OF THE GAME CAN BE ADJUSTED.

THERE'S AN OVERALL OF FOUR DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, ALL OF THEM BASED ON COMIC BOOKS OF THE SERIES (NAMELY: ASTERIX IN BRITAIN, ASTERIX IN SWITZERLAND, ASTERIX AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES, ASTERIX IN SPAIN). AT THE END OF EACH OF THESE STAGES YOU HAVE TO CONTEND IN A CONTEST TYPICAL FOR THE COUNTRY AND ALSO TAKEN FROM THE PLOT OF THE COMICS: IN BRITANNIA YOU TAKE PART IN A RUGBY MATCH, IN SWITZERLAND YOU HAVE TO BLAST SAFES, IN GREECE YOU TAKE PART IN THE OLYMPIC GAMES AND IN SPAIN YOU HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST (OR RUN FROM) A BULL - VICTORY WILL GET YOU THE DESIRED TROPHY!</desc>

		<name>Astérix : Search for Dogmatix</name>
		<desc>ASTERIX AND OBELIX (BASED ON THE FRENCH COMIC BOOK SERIES), MUST EMBARK ON A JOURNEY FROM THE FORESTS OF FRANCE TO THE COLISEUMS OF ROME. THEIR GOAL IS TO FIND OBELIX'S LOVABLE PET DOG, DOGMATIX. PLAYERS TAKE CONTROL OF ASTERIX OR OBELIX, AND RUN, JUMP AND PUNCH THROUGH VARIOUS WELL-DRAWN AND COLORFUL LEVELS IN THIS SIDE-SCROLLING ADVENTURE GAME.

THIS TITLE IS SOMEWHAT NON-LINEAR, AND ALLOWS PLAYERS TO CHOOSE THE ORDER IN WHICH TO VISIT STAGES, AS WELL AS THE NUMEROUS MINI-GAMES. THE STAGE-SELECT SCREEN IS A MINI-MAP, AND AFTER SELECTING TO PLAY EITHER ASTERIX OR OBELIX, PLAYERS CAN VISIT THE BOSS ARENA, THE INN (EXTRA ENERGY, HINTS AND PASSWORDS ARE FOUND HERE), AS WELL AS THE THE LOCAL MINI-GAME. THESE MINI-GAMES BECOME AVAILABLE FROM THE TITLE-SCREEN UNDER THE "INSTANT FUN" OPTION. THEY VARY FROM A "MEMORY" STYLE SHIELD-MATCHING GAME TO HUMOROUS EVENTS SUCH AS "THROW A ROMAN MINI GAME".

BOTH ASTERIX AND OBELIX PLAY DIFFERENTLY AS THEY HAVE INDIVIDUAL ABILITIES AND LIMITATIONS. ASTERIX IS MORE NIMBLE, CAN RUN FASTER AND JUMP HIGHER, WHEREAS OBELIX IS MORE POWERFUL (BEING ABLE TO BASH THROUGH SOME WALLS) BUT NOTICEABLY SLOWER. THESE DIFFERENCES ARE HIGHLIGHTED BY THE OBSTACLES PRESENTED IN THE STAGES - THERE ARE MANY JUMPS TO MAKE AS WELL AS MANY ENEMIES (ROMAN SOLDIERS, BOARS, CENTURIONS) TO DISPOSE OF. IN THE QUEST TO FIND DOGMATIX, IT IS VITAL TO COLLECT KEYS HIDDEN WITHIN THE LEVELS TO MAKE AVAILABLE NEW AREAS. SIMILARLY, IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO COLLECT COINS FROM BEATEN ENEMIES AS THEY ALLOW THE PURCHASES AT EACH INN, (WHICH IS APTLY MANNED BY GETAFIX HIMSELF!).</desc>

		<desc>UNLIKE ACTIVISION'S EARLIER REMAKE OF AN ATARI ARCADE CLASSIC, BATTLEZONE, THIS ONE STAYS CLOSE TO ITS NAMESAKE.  TAKE THE ORIGINAL, ATARI COIN-OP GAME ASTEROIDS, ADD IN THE FEATURES OF THE ATARI 2600 CARTRIDGE, THEN GIVE IT 3-D GRAPHICS AND A BUNCH OF POWER-UPS, AND YOU'VE GOT ACTIVISION'S ASTEROIDS REMAKE.

YOU ARE AN EMPLOYEE OF THE ASTRO-MINING CORPORATION.  YOUR MISSION IS TO SIMPLY GO TO AN ASSIGNED AREA OF SPACE AND CLEAR THE AREA OF ASTEROIDS AND THE OCCASSIONAL DEBRIS.  THE GAME CONSISTS OF FIVE ZONES, EACH WITH A DIFFERENT BACKGROUND AND SOME WITH SPECIAL FEATURES.  EACH ZONE HAS 15 LEVELS.  IN ADDITION TO THE STANDARD ASTEROIDS, THERE ARE ALSO MINED ASTEROIDS THAT EXPLODE; INDESTRUCTIBLE ASTEROIDS THAT ARE, WELL, INDESTRUCTIBLE; FIREBALL COMETS; CRYSTAL ASTEROIDS THAT REGENERATE; ALIEN EGG ASTEROIDS CONTAINING DEADLY BABY SPACE WORMS; AND ANCIENT ENERGY ASTEROIDS THAT SHOOT BACK!  AND THERE'S PLENTY OF ENEMIES IN ADDITION TO THE ASTEROIDS, SUCH AS STANDARD AND SUPER SAUCERS, ASTEROIDS TUGS, FUEL TRANSPORTS, HEXES, NUKE DRIVERS, AND VULTUROIDS.

THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF SHIPS TO CHOOSE FROM, EACH WITH DIFFERENT STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES.  THERE ARE ALSO THREE SKILL LEVELS.  IF YOU BEAT THE GAME AT EXPERT OR HIGHER, YOU GAIN ACCESS TO A FOURTH TYPE OF SHIP.  ALL SHIPS FEATURES THE STANDARD LASER, SHIELD, FLIP (INSTANTLY FLIPS YOUR SHIP 180 DEGREES), AND HYPERSPACE.  THERE ARE ALSO LIMITED POWER-UPS YOU CAN  PICK UP SUCH AS GUNSAT, MINES, HOMING MISSILES, PLASMA DRILL, AND TRIGGER BOMBS.

THE GAME SUPPORTS EITHER ONE OR TWO PLAYERS.  IN TWO PLAYER MODE, THE OBJECT IS TO SIMPLY OUTSCORE YOUR OPPONENT IN A RANDOM ZONE AND LEVEL.  YOU CANNOT DIRECTLY KILL YOUR OPPONENT BY SHOOTING HIM, BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS....

LASTLY, IF YOU SHOOT THE CLASSIC-STYLE ASTEROID IN LEVEL 15 OF THE FIRST ZONE, YOU'LL FIND THE OPTION OF "CLASSIC ASTEROIDS" NOW APPEARING ON THE MAIN MENU.</desc>

		<name>Ballistic</name>
		<desc>BALLISTIC IS A PUZZLE GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYER MUST PLACE 3 PATTERNED BALLS NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO CLEAR THEM. IT IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO PUYO PUYO IN THIS RESPECT. HOWEVER BALLISTIC PLACES THE PLAYER IN THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN SHOOTING THE BALLS OUTWARD. IN PANIC! MODE, A CONSTANT STRING OF BALLS APPEAR AND THE PLAYER MUST KEEP DESTROYING SIMILAR BALLS TO KEEP THE STRING SHORT AND PREVENT IT FROM SNAKING AROUND AND REACHING THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN. IN CHECKMATE MODE, A LIMITED AMOUNT OF BALLS ARE GIVEN TO THE PLAYER WHICH THEY MUST USE TO DESTROY ALL THE BALLS ON THE SCREEN. STRATEGY IS USED HERE SINCE THE AMOUNT OF BALLS DESTROYED MUST BE MAXIMIZED.

BALLISTIC ALSO FEATURES A VERSUS MODE IN WHICH PLAYERS CAN CHALLENGE ONE ANOTHER. SIMILAR TO OTHER PUZZLE GAMES VERSUS MODES, ONE PLAYER'S SUCCESS RESULTS IN ADDITIONAL BALLS ON THE OTHER PLAYER'S SCREEN WHICH THEY THEN MUST CLEAR.</desc>

RESCUE MISSIONS COME IN OVER THE PHONE OR VIA E-MAIL; AFTER LEARNING WHICH PET IS MISSING WHERE, TRAVEL WITH BARBIE ON HER SCOOTER TO ONE OF THREE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH TO SEARCH FOR ONE OF EIGHT LOST PETS. IN MANY MISSIONS, YOU'LL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ENTICE SCARED ANIMALS TO COME TO YOU, OR HOW TO RETRIEVE PETS TRAPPED IN TREES OR OTHER STICKY SITUATIONS. IF YOU GET STUCK YOURSELF, BARBIE WILL GIVE YOU HINTS. WITH EACH SUCCESSFUL MISSION, YOU'LL RECEIVE A PRINTABLE PAW &amp; PURR AWARD THAT HANGS ON THE PET RESCUE CENTER WALL.

RESCUED PETS COME BACK TO THE PET RESCUE CENTER WITH YOU AND BARBIE TO WAIT FOR THEIR OWNERS AND RECEIVE A LITTLE TLC. NURSE THEM BACK TO HEALTH IN THE CARE CENTER, WHERE YOU'LL GIVE RECOVERED PETS WATER, TREATS, VITAMINS AND GROOMING. YOU MAY ALSO NEED TO BANDAGE A HURT LEG OR PICK BURRS FROM RUFFLED FUR. AFTER CREATING A FILE FOR THEM IN THE COMPUTER AND GIVING THEM A NAME YOU SELECT FROM A LIST OF SUGGESTIONS, THE ANIMALS GO TO ONE OF TWO PLAYROOMS TO WAIT FOR THEIR OWNERS.

IN THE MEANTIME, YOU CAN PLAY WITH THEM, PLUS ALL THE OTHER PETS ALREADY IN THE PLAYROOM--A KITTEN, BUNNY, HAMSTER, PUPPY, AND A TURTLE. SELECT WHICH ANIMAL YOU'D LIKE TO PET, THEN USE THE CURSOR TO STROKE AN ANIMAL'S HEAD OR BACK OR SCRATCH IT UNDER THE CHIN. THE ANIMALS RESPOND TO YOUR ATTENTION BY LICKING, ROLLING OVER, PURRING, OR BARKING.
 
THERE IS A RELATED MINI-GAME FOR EACH KIND OF ANIMAL--KITTEN KEEPAWAY, PUPPY TREAT TOSS, HAMSTER TRAIL, ETC.--AND IF YOU DO WELL ENOUGH, YOU'LL SEE THE ANIMAL PERFORM A SPECIAL TRICK. A FEW OF THE GAMES REQUIRE THE USE OF LOGIC AND SPATIAL APTITUDE, BUT FOR THE MOST PART THEY CHALLENGE THE PLAYERS' MOUSE MASTERY AND HAND-EYE COORDINATION.</desc>

DURING BOTH GAMES, YOU CAN PICK UP "CHARABOMBS", CREATURES THAT YOU CAN RAISE AS YOUR OWN, AND FIGHT AGAINST OTHER PLAYERS CHARABOMBS. IT'S A SIMPLE BONUS GAME OF ROCK/PAPER/SCISSORS, BUT THE ONLY WAY TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE ADVENTURE IS BY LINKING BOTH GAMES TOGETHER VIA LINK CABLE AND PASS OVER LEVELS FROM ONE CART TO THE OTHER, AS EACH GAME HAS UNIQUE LEVELS, SO AS TO COLLECT ALL OF THE CHARABOMBS.

IN MAX: BLUE YOU PLAY AS BOMBERMAN HIMSELF, WITH ALL OF THE CLASSIC GRAPHICS AND SOUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN PART OF THE SERIES FROM THE START.</desc>

HOWEVER, INSTEAD OF PLAYING AS BOMBERMAN, YOU PLAY AS MAX, WHO STILL IS MUCH THE SAME AS BOMBERMAN EXCEPT FOR LOOKS. THE GRAPHICS ARE ALSO SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FOR EACH LEVEL COMPARED TO BLUE.

THE TASK STAYS THE SAME, PLANT BOMBS TO DESTROY BLOCKS AND ENEMIES IN YOUR WAY, AS WELL AS COLLECTING CHARABOMBS, CREATURES WHO ACT MUCH THE SAME AS POKÉMON WHERE YOU RAISE THE CHARABOMBS AND FIGHT AGAINST OTHER PLAYERS. CERTAIN CHARABOMBS AND LEVELS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE IN BLUE, SO YOU MUST LINK WITH ANOTHER GAME BOY AND THE BLUE CHAMPION EDITION TO COLLECT ALL OF THE CHARABOMBS AND COMPLETE THE ADVENTURE.</desc>

THE CHARACTERS ARE CONTROLLED INDIRECTLY USING THE MOUSE, AS YOU ACTIVATE EACH SOLDIER OR GROUP OF THEM BY HIGHLIGHTING THEM, CLICK THE LEFT BUTTON TO MOVE THEM TO A PARTICULAR SPOT, AND THE RIGHT BUTTON FOR THEM TO FIRE GUNS AT AN ENEMY. YOU CAN ALSO PICK UP GRENADES, WHICH CAN BE USED TO DESTROY GROUPS OF ENEMIES OR BUILDINGS (BY PRESSING BOTH BUTTONS AT ONCE). 

EACH MISSION HAS A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE, AND SOME FEATURE VEHICLES SUCH AS TANKS TO MAKE THINGS EASIER. YOUR TROOPS CAN CROSS WATER BUT CAN'T SHOOT WITHIN IT, SO FINDING AND CONTROLLING BRIDGES IS OFTEN CRUCIAL.

KREMLINGS, CROCODILE-LIKE CREATURES, INCLUDE KRITTERS (THEY SUCCUMB TO A SIMPLE JUMP ON THE HEAD), KRUSHAS (THEY ARE VIRTUALLY INDESTRUCTIBLE), AND OTHERS. THERE ARE ALSO OTHER ENEMIES THAT BLOCK YOUR PATH, SUCH AS BEAVERS, SNAKES, VULTURES. LEADING THEM ARE DASTARDLY BOSSES, INCLUDING VERY GNAWTY, NECKY, BUMBLE B, AND DUMB DRUM, AND THEY ALL BAR THE WAY WITH THEIR OWN SPECIAL BLEND OF VILLAINY.

DONKEY KONG IS JOINED BY DIDDY KONG: THESE TWO PRIMATES DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY. FOR EXAMPLE, DONKEY KONG IS GENERALLY STRONGER; HE CAN DESTROY MOST ENEMIES WITH A SINGLE JUMP AND CAN LIFT BARRELS STRAIGHT OVER HIS HEAD TO THROW THEM FARTHER. ON THE OTHER HAND, DIDDY IS FASTER AND NOT AS STRONG AS DONKEY; HE CAN RUN REALLY FAST AND DO CARTWHEELS. DIDDY CARRIES BARRELS IN FRONT OF HIM, CREATING A SHIELD AGAINST FRONTAL ATTACKS.

THE GAME IS SPLIT INTO DIFFERENT WORLDS, WHICH ARE SPLIT INTO DIFFERENT LEVELS. EACH LEVEL CONTAINS BONUS AREAS, WHERE ONE CAN COLLECT BANANAS, MEDALLIONS, AND LIVES. AT THE END OF EACH WORLD IS A BOSS, WHICH IS USUALLY A LARGER VERSION OF A MINOR ENEMY.</desc>

		<desc>DROPZONE WAS THE FIRST GAME TO PROPEL ARCHER MACLEAN TO STARDOM. THE GAME, ORIGINALLY WRITTEN FOR THE 8-BIT ATARIS, IS BASICALLY A DEFENDER CLONE, BUT POPULAR BECAUSE IT SO CLOSELY RECREATES THE GAMEPLAY OF THE ORIGINAL DEFENDER, WITH ITS SPEEDY SCROLLING AND FRANTIC GAMEPLAY.

THE PLAYER IS A SPACEMAN WITH A JET-PACK, FLYING ACROSS A BARREN LANDSCAPE WHOSE SKIES ARE INHABITED BY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ALIENS; FROM THE SIMPLE PLANTER TO THE SLOWLY ADVANCING BLUNDER STORM OR THE QUICK, AGGRESSIVE NEMESITE. 

PLANTERS AND NEMESITES WILL TRY TO PICKUP THE SMALL MEN WALKING ON THE SURFACE, WHO MUST THEN BE RESCUED. YOU MUST SHOOT DOWN THE ALIEN, WHILE AVOIDING TO HIT THE MAN. SOMETIMES, THE ALIENS WILL CARRY AN ANDROID, WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE HUMAN BUT DEADLY. CARE MUST BE TAKEN SO AS TO NOT PICK UP THE ANDROIDS. ALL MEN MUST BE TRANSPORTED TO A SURFACE BASE, WHERE THEY ARE PUT IN SAFETY. THIS IS THE DROPZONE.</desc>

		<name>Grand Theft Auto</name>
		<desc>IN GRAND THEFT AUTO, THE PLAYER TAKES THE ROLE OF A SMALL-TIME CRIMINAL TRYING TO MAKE IT BIG WITH THE MOB. STEALING CARS, DOING JOBS FOR THE GANGSTERS AND BEHAVING GENERALLY ANTI-SOCIAL ARE THE WAY TO SUCCESS.

THE ACTION MOVES THROUGH SIX LEVELS SPREAD OVER THREE DIFFERENT CITIES, EACH BASED ON A REAL US CITY: LIBERTY CITY (BASED ON NEW YORK CITY), SAN ANDREAS (BASED ON SAN FRANCISCO) AND VICE CITY (BASED ON MIAMI). TO FINISH A LEVEL, A CERTAIN SCORE MUST BE REACHED. STEALING CARS AND CRASHING INTO TRAFFIC, DRIVING OVER PEDESTRIANS AND KILLING COPS ALL RAISE THE SCORE, BUT THE 
BIG POINTS ARE MADE THROUGH JOBS. ANSWERING PHONES OR ENTERING SPECIAL CARS BRINGS MISSION ASSIGNMENTS, FROM SIMPLE "DITCH-A-HOT-CAR" JOBS TO SUPPORTING BANK ROBBERIES OR CARRYING OUT ASSASSINATIONS. COMPLETING A MISSION WILL RAISE THE SCORE SUBSTANTIALLY AND ALSO INCREASE THE SCORE MULTIPLIER, SO THAT COMPLETING THE NEXT FELONY WILL GAIN EVEN MORE POINTS.

CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR COMES WITH A PRICE OF COURSE: IF POLICEMEN WITNESS A CRIME, THE PLAYER'S WANTED LEVEL RISES. AT THE LOWEST LEVEL, A SINGLE POLICE CAR MIGHT GIVE CHASE, WHEREAS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL WHOLE CAR SQUADS HUNT THE PLAYER, THE POLICE SET UP ROADBLOCKS AND SHOOT TO KILL. THE ONLY WAY TO EVADE THE COPS IS TO FIND A RESPRAY SHOP AND GET A NEW PAINT JOB WITH NEW LICENSE PLATES. THIS COSTS MONEY WHICH IS DEDUCTED FROM THE SCORE, HOWEVER. BUT EVEN DYING OR BEING ARRESTED ARE NOT THE END. THE PLAYER HAS SEVERAL LIVES, AND ENDING UP IN JAIL SIMPLY RESULTS IN BEING STRIPPED OF ALL WEAPONS AND ARMOR AND THE SCORE MULTIPLIER BEING LOWERED.

THE ENTIRE ACTION IS VIEWED FROM A TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE, WHICH ZOOMS OUT WHILE DRIVING A CAR, FOR A BETTER OVERVIEW AT HIGH SPEEDS. THE CITIES ARE MANY SCREENS LARGE AND CAN BE FREELY EXPLORED. CRATES ARE SCATTERED OVER THE CITIES, WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE WEAPONS (FROM PISTOLS TO ROCKET LAUNCHERS), ARMOR OR OTHER BONUS ITEMS: EXTRA LIVES, POLICE BRIBES (USED TO REDUCE THE WANTED LEVEL TO ZERO) AND GET-OUT-OF-JAIL-FREE CARDS (USED TO RETAIN SCORE MULTIPLIER AND WEAPONS WHEN BUSTED). DOZENS OF DIFFERENT VEHICLES ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE TAKING, EACH WITH UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS: A BUS WILL HANDLE VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN A SPORTS CAR.</desc>

		<desc>THE SECOND HARRY POTTER ROLE-PLAYING GAME FOLLOWS DIRECTLY ON FROM THE FIRST, WITH MOSTLY THE SAME GAME MECHANICS, CONTROLS AND EVEN SOME OF THE GRAPHICS.

TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY OF THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, YOUNG WIZARD HARRY POTTER MUST FIGHT TURN-BASED BATTLES AND SOLVE QUESTS. IN THIS GAME, HE IS NOT ALONE, AS A PARTY SYSTEM WAS ADDED: HIS FRIENDS RON AND HERMIONE (AND SOME OTHER CHARACTERS) WILL JOIN HARRY IN THE BATTLES. WHILE HARRY (AS IN THE PREVIOUS GAME) CAN USE CARD COMBINATIONS OF FAMOUS WITCHES AND WIZARDS CARDS TO PRODUCE SPECIAL ATTACKS AND EFFECTS, HIS FRIENDS HAVE OTHER MEANS: RON CAN UNLEASH HIS RAT SCABBERS IN SPECIAL RAT ATTACKS AND HERMIONE, BEING THE KNOW-IT-ALL THAT SHE IS, INFLUENCES COMBAT THROUGH "LECTURE ATTACKS", USING HELPFUL HINTS LIKE "BE CAREFUL!" (WHICH INCREASES DEFENSE, FOR EXAMPLE).

GONE IS THE POTION-MIXING FROM THE FIRST GAME, BUT ASIDE FROM THE PARTY SYSTEM, SEVERAL OTHER FEATURES WERE ADDED: THE INFORMOUS SPELL DIVULGES INFORMATION ABOUT STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF ENEMIES, WHICH IS STORED AND CAN BE ACCESSED LATER. TO AID IN FINDING ONE'S WAY AROUND HOGWARTS, FLOOR MAPS WERE ADDED.

LIKE THE FIRST GAME, THIS ONE ALSO INCLUDES SEVERAL MINI-GAMES, INCLUDING QUIDDITCH, THAT ONCE FOUND IN THE GAME CAN BE ACCESSED FROM THE MAIN MENU.</desc>

		<name>Hexcite: The Shapes of Victory</name>
		<desc>HEXCITE IS A PUZZLE GAME PLAYED ON A HONEYCOMB-LIKE PLAYING FIELD. IN THE CENTER IS A HEXAGON; SIX MORE HEXAGONS MAKE UP THE ENTIRE PLAYING FIELD. BECAUSE OF THE TURN-BASED GAMEPLAY, TWO PEOPLE CAN PLAY USING ONLY ONE SYSTEM. TWO-PLAYER LINK MODE IS ALSO SUPPORTED.

PLAYERS BEGIN BY PLACING A GEOMETRIC SHAPE (TRIANGLE, HEXAGON, PARALLELOGRAM, ETC.) IN THE CENTER HEXAGON.  THE CPU OR HUMAN OPPONENT THEN PLACES ANOTHER SHAPE ADJACENT (AND TOUCHING COMPLETELY ON ONE SIDE) TO A PREVIOUSLY PLAYED PIECE.  PLAYERS SCORE BONUS POINTS FOR COMPLETING ANY FULL HEXAGON. MUCH OF THE STRATEGY IN THIS GAME IS IN TRICKING YOUR OPPONENT INTO LETTING YOU TAKE A BONUS. BONUSES ARE ALSO SCORED FOR PLACING A PIECE SO THAT TWO SIDES WILL CONTRIBUTE A SCORE. THE GAME IS OVER WHEN ALL PIECES HAVE BEEN PLAYED, OR IF THE REMAINING PIECES CANNOT BE PLAYED.  IN THAT CASE POINTS ARE SUBTRACTED FOR ANY REMAINING PIECES, BASED ON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SHAPE (TWICE AS MANY POINTS ARE SUBTRACTED FOR A HEXAGON COMPARED TO A TRIANGLE.)

IN JAPAN, THIS GAME HAS SEEN SEVERAL WINDOWS VERSIONS, AND EVEN HAS BEEN RELEASED AS A BOARD GAME.</desc>

SEASON MODE FEATURES 3 CHAMPIONSHIPS, EACH WITH THREE STAGES COMPOSED OF FOUR RACES. THE GOAL IS TO WIN ALL 9 GOLD MEDALS BY OBTAINING MORE POINTS THAN THE COMPETITION. ARCADE MODE IS THE SAME, EXCEPT ALL CHAMPIONSHIPS AND STAGES, AS WELL AS JEREMY MCGRATH, ARE UNLOCKED FROM THE START.
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHAMPIONSHIPS IS THE ENGINE SIZE - WITH LARGER (THUS FASTER) BIKES, THE PLAYER HAS LESS TIME TO REACT, AND GOING HEAD TO HEAD INTO THE EDGE OF THE TRACK CAN BE A MATTER OF A SIMPLE BUMP IN 80CC TO A SPECTACULAR FLIP INTO THE STANDS IN 250CC, ALSO BECAUSE IT BECOMES A LOT HARDER TO DO SHARP TURNS IN A LIMITED SPACE.

WHILE IT CAN BE PLAYED AS A STRAIGHTFORWARD RACING GAME, BY PERFORMING TRICKS THE PLAYER CAN OBTAIN SOME POWERUPS - A BOMB WILL KNOCK DOWN THE NEXT OPPONENT, THE ARROW TEMPORARILY BOOSTS BIKE STATS AND THE SHIELD ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO BARGE INTO ONE OPPONENT, KNOCKING HIM OFF HIS BIKE. THERE IS ONE BIG CATCH - THE SKULL AND BONES KNOCK THE PLAYER OUT OF HIS BIKE, WHICH CAN PROVE TO BE DECISIVE IN A CLOSE RACE.</desc>

		<desc>KLUSTAR TAKES TETRIS AND TWISTS IT AROUND. RATHER THAN MOVING FALLING PIECES, YOU MUST MOVE AND ROTATE A GROUP OF PIECES THAT IS STUCK TOGETHER. THE GOAL IS TO GET THE MOVING PIECES TO STICK TOGETHER, FORMING A SOLID SQUARE OF BLOCKS. ONE THAT IS DONE, THE SQUARE DISAPPEARS AND THE REMAINING PIECES COLLAPSE INWARD, CREATING MORE ROOM TO MANEUVER. IF YOU MISS A PIECE, IT WILL STICK TO THE SIDES OF THE PLAY AREA AND CANNOT BE REMOVED. THE GAME ENDS WHEN THE CLUSTER OF PIECES BECOMES SO BIG THAT IT CANNOT FIT INTO THE SCREEN. WITH 16 SKILL LEVELS, THE DEGREE OF CHALLENGE IS ALWAYS APPROPRIATE. IF FRIENDS WANT TO JOIN THE ACTION, THEY CAN VIA A LINK CABLE. SEE HOW LONG YOU CAN LAST IN KLUSTAR.</desc>

BUGS AND LOLA CAN JUMP AND HIT THINGS WITH A MALLET (OR ROLLING PIN FOR LOLA). THEY ALSO BOTH FEATURE UNIQUE SPECIAL ABILITIES. BUGS BUNNY CAN DIG AND MOVE HEAVY CHESTS AND LOLA CAN FLOAT DOWN SAFELY FROM LARGE HEIGHTS WITH HER PARASOL. PLAYERS CAN SWITCH BETWEEN CHARACTERS AT ANY TIME.

POWER-UPS IN THE GAME INCLUDE CARROTS FOR ENERGY REQUIRED FOR SPECIAL ABILITIES, A SUPER CARROT THAT ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO FLY LIKE A HELICOPTER (USING HIS EARS) AND THE HABANERO CARROT, WHICH MAKES THE PLAYER INVINCIBLE FOR A WHILE.

IF YOU COLLECT THE LETTERS EXTRA DURING THE LEVEL YOU GET TO PLAY A SMALL MINIGAME WHERE YOU HAVE TO SHOOT FIRECRACKERS AT MOVING TARGETS.

EACH OF THE WORLDS ENDS WITH A SHOWDOWN WITH THE MAJOR CHARACTER OF THAT WORLD. USUALLY THIS INVOLVES RUNNING FROM A VEHICLE THAT PURSUES THE PLAYER, WHILE AVOIDING OBSTACLES.</desc>

THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT TYPES OF LEVELS, WHICH ALTERNATE EACH OTHER. THE FIRST TYPE FEATURES AN ISOMETRIC VIEW OF THE WORLD. HERE THE PLAYER HAS TO NAVIGATE SYLVESTER AROUND IN THE HOPE TO FIND TWEETY. TO DO THIS HE'LL HAVE TO SOLVE VARIOUS PUZZLES AND AVOID ENEMIES LIKE HECTOR AND GRANNY. PUZZLES INVOLVE COLLECTING ITEMS, COMBINING THEM AND USING THEM AT THE RIGHT SPOT IN A ROOM.

ONCE YOU FOUND TWEETY YOU WILL HAVE TO CHASE HIM IN A 2D SIDE-SCROLLING LEVEL. YOU HAVE TO AVOID OBSTACLES FROM TRIPPING YOU IN ORDER TO CATCH HIM. HE SUBSEQUENTLY ESCAPES, WHICH ADVANCES YOU TO THE NEXT LEVEL WHERE YOU HAVE TO FIND TWEETY AGAIN.</desc>

BUGS BUNNY HAPPENS TO OVERHEAR THE MARTIAN'S PLAN, AND NOW HE MUST TRAVEL THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND COLLECT THE OTHER LOONEY TUNES CHARACTERS 47 IN ALL. WHILE BUGS CAN PERFORM BASIC TASKS, SOLVING ALL OF THE GAME'S PUZZLES AND COLLECTING ALL 10 TELEPORTER PIECES REQUIRES THE SPECIAL SKILLS AND TALENTS OF EACH CHARACTER. FOR EXAMPLE, ELMER FUDD CAN BLAST OBSTACLES WITH HIS GUN, WHILE DAFFY DUCK CAN SWIM AND DIVE INTO DEEP WATER.

		<name>Metal Gear Solid</name>
		<desc>METAL GEAR SOLID (ORIGINAL JAPANESE NAME: METAL GEAR: GHOST BABEL) FOR GAMEBOY COLOR IS NOT THE SAME GAME AS THE POPULAR PLAYSTATION/PC INSTALLMENT OF THE SERIES. IT IS NOT SET WITHIN THE STORYLINE OF METAL GEAR SERIES, BUT INSTEAD TELLS AN UNRELATED EPISODE FEATURING THE SAME HERO - SPECIAL AGENT SOLID SNAKE. A SECRET GOVERNMENT PROJECT, CODENAMED "BABEL", ATTEMPTS TO REVIVE THE METAL GEAR PROJECT - DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGHLY DESTRUCTIVE MECH WEAPON. BUT AN ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS GINDRAN LIBERATION FRONT HIJACKED THE METAL GEAR PROTOTYPE, WITHOUT WHICH ANY FURTHER DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE USELESS. SOLID SNAKE IS SENT TO INFILTRATE OUTER HEAVEN, A LOCATION NOT ENTIRELY UNFAMILIAR TO HIM, AND TO RETRIEVE THE PROTOTYPE.

THE GAME IS SIMILAR IN STYLE AND GAMEPLAY TO EARLY METAL GEAR GAMES. IT IS VIEWED FROM TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE, AND ITS GAMEPLAY IS MOSTLY BASED ON STEALTH. SNAKE HAS TO SNEAK PAST THE GUARDS, USING VARIOUS TACTICS TO DISTRACT THEM OR TO KILL THEM SILENTLY. WEAPONS, GADGETS, AND MOVES ARE ALL SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN THE OTHER METAL GEAR SOLID GAME. FROM TIME TO TIME SNAKE WILL ALSO ENCOUNTER BOSSES WHOM HE WILL HAVE TO DEFEAT IN ORDER TO PROCEED TO THE NEXT AREA. VIRTUAL MISSIONS FOR SNAKE ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS RELEASE.</desc>

		<path>./Metal Walker (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Metal Walker</name>
		<desc>METAL WALKER IS A MECHANICAL TAKE ON POKÉMON, WHERE THE STORY TAKES PLACE IN THE FUTURE ON AN ISLAND WHERE A MYSTERIOUS ELEMENT CALLED CORE HAS BEEN DISCOVERED.  THIS "CORE" ELEMENT WAS USED TO CREATE A HIGHLY ADVANCED RACE OF ROBOTS CALLED METAL WALKERS THAT ARE USED FOR BOTH LABOR AND PROTECTION FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE ISLAND.  ONE DAY, HOWEVER, A GANG OF ROBOTS DECIDE TO REBEL AND END UP KILLING A VERY PROMINENT MEMBER OF THE ISLAND.  THE PLAYER THEN TAKES CONTROL OF THE SON, TETSUO, WITH THE HELP OF DR. HAWK AND TETSUO'S METAL WALKER IN AN ATTEMPT TO HUNT DOWN THE REBEL ROBOTS AND AVENGE HIS FATHER'S DEATH.

THE GAMEPLAY IS VERY SIMILAR TO POKÉMON, WHERE THE PLAYER EXPLORES VARIOUS AREAS OF THE ISLAND SEARCHING FOR CLUES CALLED DATA PACKETS AND BATTLING OTHER METAL WALKERS OR WILD WALKERS CALLED METAL BUSTERS, BUT INSTEAD OF CAPTURING THESE WALKERS, THE PLAYER INSTEAD DESTROYS THEM.  DESTROYING THESE OTHER WALKERS RESULTS BOTH IN SCRAP METAL AND ITEMS CALLED CAPSULES THAT CAN BE USED TO UPGRADE OR "EVOLVE" TETSUO'S WALKER INTO A MORE ADVANCED FORM.  ADDITIONALLY, THE PLAYER CAN TAKE THE SCRAP METAL TO THE JUNK SHOP WHERE THEY CAN ALSO BE TURNED INTO CAPSULES AS WELL.  ADDITIONALLY, CAPSULES CAN NOT ONLY CONTAIN POWER-UPS, BUT TRAPS AS WELL THAT CAN BE USED IN BATTLES.

THE BATTLES ARE ALSO DIFFERENT, WHEREAS THIS ONE THE ATTACKS CONSISTS OF ROLLING ATTACKS THAT ARE ANGLED OFF OF THE WALLS OF ARENAS.  ADDITIONALLY, IF A PLAYER FIGHTS MULTIPLE OPPONENTS, ALL OF THE ENEMIES WILL BE PRESENT ON THE SCREEN AT ONE TIME AND IF THEY CHOOSE THE RIGHT ATTACK AND ANGLE, CAN RESULT IN MULTIPLE HITS ON MULTIPLE OPPONENTS.

THERE ARE ALSO THREE TYPES OF WALKERS: LAND, MARINE, AND SKY WHERE, JUST LIKE IN POKÉMON, SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE OTHER (EX. LAND WALKERS HAVE ADVANTAGES OVER MARINE WALKERS BUT ARE VULNERABLE AND WEAKER TO SKY WALKER ATTACKS).  BASE CAMPS CAN ALSO BE BUILT AROUND VARIOUS AREAS OF THE ISLAND AND CAN BE USED FOR RESTORING THE HEALTH OF THE PLAYERS WALKER.

AS THE PLAYER PROGRESSES FARTHER INTO THE GAME, THEY WILL ENCOUNTER OVER 100 DIFFERENT WALKERS, EACH WITH THEIR OWN STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES AS WELL AS BOSSES THAT HAVE TO BE DEFEATED IN ORDER TO ACCESS MORE AREAS OF THE ISLAND.  PLAYERS CAN ALSO USE THE LINK CABLE TO BOTH BATTLE THEIR METAL WALKERS OR EVEN EXCHANGE THEIR BASE CAMPS.</desc>

PROFESSOR LUDWIG VON DRAKE HAD JUST FINISHED ALL THE CARNIVAL FLOATS AND WAS SHOWING THEM TO MICKEY, MINNIE, AND ALL THEIR FRIENDS.  HOWEVER, SPYING FROM HIS CREEPY MANSION ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN WAS BIG BAD PETE, FURIOUS AT THE GROUP ENJOYING THEMSELVES.  SOON, HE'D GATHERED HIS CRONIES AND RACED INTO TOWN, SWIPING ALL THE FLOATS AND DECORATIONS.  ALL THAT WAS LEFT WAS A LETTER CHALLENGING THEM TO A RACE TO GET THEIR THINGS BACK.

MICKEY'S RACING ADVENTURE IS AN ADVENTURE GAME THAT CENTERS AROUND ISOMETRIC RACING CHALLENGES IN VARIOUS WORLDS.  IT'S POSSIBLE TO PLAY AS MICKEY AND HIS FRIENDS, AS THEY EXPLORE VARIOUS PARTS OF MICKEY'S TOWN, EARNING MONEY FOR CAR UPGRADES AND FINDING TRAIN TOKENS TO TRAVEL TO DIFFERENT WORLDS AND CHALLENGE PETE AND HIS HENCHMEN TO VARIOUS RACES.  FOR A FEE, MAGICA DE SPELL WILL ALSO CONJURE UP SPELLS FOR YOU TO USE IN RACES AND GET AN EDGE ON YOUR OPPONENTS.

THE FIRST TIME YOU TRAVEL TO A NEW WORLD VIA THE TRAIN, CASEY JR., YOU MUST PLAY A SPECIAL TRAIN MINI-GAME.  PETE HAS MUDDLED THE TRACKS LEADING TO THE WORLDS, AND YOU MUST GUIDE CASEY JR. BY SHIFTING THE TRACK TILES AROUND SO THAT HE DOESN'T HIT ANY DEAD-ENDS.  THERE ARE ALSO TNT DETONATORS THAT YOU MUST SET OFF BY RUNNING INTO THEM BEFORE YOU CAN GUIDE CASEY JR. TO THE EXIT.

THE GAME ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO PLAY AS PLUTO - WHILE HE CAN'T RACE HIMSELF, HE CAN SNIFF AROUND TOWN AND DIG FOR SECRETS.  HE'LL ALSO FIND HIDDEN TUNNELS WHICH LET YOU PLAY A DIGGER-LIKE MINI-GAME WHERE YOU MUST EITHER COLLECT ALL THE BONES UNDERGROUND, OR DEFEAT THE OTHER DOGS IN THE AREA BY DROPPING ROCKS ON THEM.  AFTER COMPLETING THE OBJECTIVE, PLUTO MUST THEN HEAD TO THE EXIT.

MICKEY'S RACING ADVENTURE ALSO SUPPORTS THE GAME BOY COLOR'S INFRA-RED FEATURE BY ALLOWING YOU TO SEND E-MAIL TO YOUR FRIENDS VIA THE INFRARED COMMUNICATIONS PORT.  ONCE YOU UNLOCK THE PRINT SHOP, YOU CAN ALSO USE THE GAME BOY PRINTER TO PRINT OUT ASSORTED DISNEY STICKERS.</desc>

		<desc>THE WEASELS HAVE KIDNAPPED MICKEY MOUSE'S DOG!  ALL THAT WAS LEFT WAS A RANSOM NOTE WITH A PICTURE OF PLUTO BEING HAULED AWAY IN A VAN, AND SOME SCRAWLED WRITING TAUNTING MICKEY TO TRY AND CATCH THEM.  NOT KNOWING WHAT ELSE TO DO, MICKEY CALLED UP HIS FRIENDS, WHO ALL VOLUNTEERED TO HELP - EVEN BIG BAD PETE PLANS TO RACE!  YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEED ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO CATCH UP WITH THE WEASELS AND RESCUE PLUTO!

MICKEY'S SPEEDWAY USA IS AN ISOMETRIC RACING GAME THAT USES THE SAME ENGINE AS MICKEY'S RACING ADVENTURE.  PLAYERS CAN CHOOSE FROM MICKEY, MINNIE, DONALD, DAISY, GOOFY OR PETE (AND SOME SECRET CHARACTERS TOO) AS THEY RACE AROUND VARIOUS FAMOUS CITIES AND LANDMARKS FROM THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING LOS ANGELES, THE GRAND CANYON, SAN FRANCISCO, MONTANA, AND YELLOWSTONE, JUST TO NAME A FEW.

THE ADVENTURE MODE OF THE GAME PLAYS OUT GRAND PRIX STYLE.  YOU MUST COMPLETE FOUR RACES IN EACH WORLD, AND AT THE END OF EACH RACE, YOU'RE GIVEN POINTS BASED ON YOUR PLACING.  THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST POINTS AT THE END OF THE FOUR RACES WINS THE TROPHY FOR THAT CIRCUIT.  THERE ARE ASSORTED POWER-UPS THAT HELP YOU AS YOU RACE, INCLUDING THE BASEBALL CHUCKER (A PROJECTILE), THE MAGNO FLYER (A HOMING MISSILE), THE CARBO SPRITZER (A TURBO), AND THE PAINT SPLOTCHER (AN OIL SLICK).

THERE IS ALSO A TIME TRIAL MODE WHICH LETS YOU RACE ANY TRACK THAT YOU'VE PREVIOUSLY UNLOCKED - WHILE YOU CAN USE IT TO PRACTICE TRACKS, THE GOAL IS TO RACE FAST ENOUGH TO BEAT THE TRACK'S LAP TIME AND EARN A GOLD STAR IN EVERY RACE.  ANOTHER MODE IS PROFESSOR VON DRAKE'S 'DRIVING SCHOOL'.  IN THIS MODE, YOU MUST COMPLETE SPECIFIC TASKS GIVEN TO YOU, SUCH AS PARKING, REVERSE PARKING AND SLALOM DRIVING.  THE FASTER YOU PERFORM THESE TASKS, THE BETTER RANKING YOU WILL RECEIVE (AGAIN, WITH A GOLD STAR AS YOUR ULTIMATE GOAL).  HOWEVER, YOU WILL RECEIVE A TIME PENALTY IF YOU HIT A CONE OR WALL, OR MISS YOUR PARKING SPOT, SO ACCURACY COUNTS AS WELL.

MICKEY'S SPEEDWAY USA SUPPORTS MANY OF THE GAME BOY COLOR'S FUNCTIONS - YOU CAN PLAY A TWO-PLAYER LINK CABLE RACE, TRANSFER DATA FROM MICKEY'S RACING ADVENTURE VIA THE IR LINK TO UNLOCK A SECRET, AND CONNECT TO THE NINTENDO 64 VERSION OF MICKEY'S SPEEDWAY USA USING THE TRANSFER PAK.  AS YOU PROGRESS THROUGH THE GAME, YOU'LL UNLOCK MANY POSTCARDS AND PICTURES FOR YOUR ALBUM, WHICH CAN BE PRINTED OUT VIA THE GAME BOY PRINTER.</desc>

		<name>Monkey Puncher</name>
		<desc>MONKEY PUNCHER IS A GAME WHERE THE GOAL IS TO TRAIN A MONKEY TO FIGHT IN BOXING MATCHES IN ORDER TO SAVE YOUR KIDNAPPED SIBLING. YOU CAN CHOOSE TO PLAY AS EITHER A BOY OR A GIRL CHARACTER; THE ONE YOU DO NOT PICK IS YOUR SIBLING. 

SHORTLY AFTER STARTING THE GAME YOU ARE GIVEN YOUR FIRST MONKEY, FREDDY. YOU CAN TRAIN HIM IN SKIPPING, USING A PUNCHBAG, DOING SIT-UPS, RUNNING AND EVEN GOING SHOPPING. THERE IS ALSO A SIXTH ACTIVITY, CALLED SPARRING. THESE ACTIVITIES WORK TO IMPROVE HIS SPEED, POWER, STRENGTH, STAMINA, KNOWLEDGE AND (FOR THE LATTER ACTIVITY) ALL OF THESE, ALTHOUGH ONLY BY A SMALL AMOUNT.

IN ALL OF THE AFOREMENTIONED APART FROM SHOPPING, YOU TRAIN YOUR MONKEY BY GETTING HIM TO COPY YOUR ACTIONS; YOUR ACTIONS ARE CONTROLLED BY THE RHYTHMIC PRESSING OF THE A BUTTON. AFTER A WHILE, YOUR MONKEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO IMITATE YOUR ACTIONS WITH EASE, EVENTUALLY BEING ABLE TO START THE ACTIVITY WITHOUT PROMPTING. IN REGARDS TO SHOPPING, YOU CAN SEND HIM OUT TO BUY WHAT YOU WANT FROM A SELECTION OF ITEMS, OR JUST LET HIM GO OUT AND BUY WHAT HE LIKES. THIS IS A GOOD WAY OF OBTAINING CERTAIN ITEMS THAT ARE OTHERWISE UNOBTAINABLE. THE RARITY OF ITEMS AND THE ACCURACY OF WHICH ITEMS IT BRINGS HOME FROM YOUR SHOPPING LIST INCREASES AS ITS KNOWLEDGE DOES. SPARRING INVOLVES PITTING YOUR OWN MONKEY AGAINST A COMPUTER CONTROLLED ONE IN ORDER TO RAISE EVERY STAT BY A SMALL AMOUNT. FINALLY, YOU CAN 'DATE' YOUR MONKEYS, EITHER WITH EACH OTHER, WITH A FRIEND'S MONKEY OR IN THE DATING SHOP AVAILABLE WITHIN THE GAME. THIS IS A GOOD WAY OF OBTAINING MONKEYS WITH HIGHER STATS, DEPENDING ON WHICH MONKEYS YOU BREED AND WITH WHOM. 

DURING BOXING MATCHES, YOU DO NOT HAVE DIRECT CONTROL OVER YOUR MONKEY, BUT IN BETWEEN BOUTS YOU CAN DO THINGS SUCH AS REFILL ITS HEALTH, STAMINA, OR BOTH. YOU CAN ALSO ADVISE IT ON WHAT STRATEGY TO USE AGAINST ITS OPPONENT. THESE MATCHES ARE WON BY EITHER A COUNT OR BY KO'ING THE OPPONENT, HOWEVER IF TIME RUNS OUT BEFORE THERE IS A CLEAR WINNER, THE WINNER IS THE MONKEY WHO IS LEFT WITH THE MOST HEALTH AT THE END OF THE MATCH.</desc>

		<desc>THE FIRST PC CONVERSION OF THE ARCADE HIT, NFL BLITZ GIVES THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE THE SAME OVER-THE-TOP TREATMENT THAT MIDWAY HAD USED SO EFFECTIVELY WITH NBA JAM.  FEATURES INCLUDE EXAGGERATED MUSCLE-BOUND PLAYER MODELS, "TURBO" BUTTONS, FAST ACTION, AND SOME PRETTY WILD RULES CHANGES (LIKE 30 YARDS FOR A FIRST DOWN!). BLITZ IS NOTHING IF NOT A UNIQUE FOOTBALL GAMING EXPERIENCE.

PLAYER TAUNTS ("THIS IS MY HOUSE!"), UNPENALIZED LATE HITS, AND AMUSING RUNNING COMMENTARY FROM THE ANNOUNCERS ("THAT WAS TOTALLY UNCALLED FOR -- BUT AWFULLY FUN TO WATCH!") ALL ADD TO THE GAME'S VIOLENT CHARM.</desc>

THE GAME HANDLES MATCHES IN THREE DIFFERENT WAYS, PLAYING THEM, WATCHING THEM OR A TEXT-BASED INTERFACE SIMILAR TO CHAMPIONSHIP MANAGER, BUT WITH HIGHLIGHTS SHOWN IN THE TOP-DOWN VIEW.

PAC-MAN'S GOAL IS CONTINUALLY CHALLENGED BY FOUR GHOSTS: THE SHY BLUE GHOST BASHFUL (INKY), THE TRAILING RED GHOST SHADOW (BLINKY), THE FAST PINK GHOST SPEEDY (PINKY), AND THE FORGETFUL ORANGE GHOST POKEY (CLYDE). ONE TOUCH FROM ANY OF THESE GHOSTS MEANS A LOSS OF LIFE FOR PAC-MAN.

PAC-MAN CAN TURN THE TABLES ON HIS PURSUERS BY EATING OF THE FOUR ENERGIZERS LOCATED WITHIN THE MAZE. DURING THIS TIME, THE GHOSTS TURN BLUE, AND PAC-MAN CAN EAT THEM FOR BONUS POINTS. THIS ONLY LASTS FOR A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME, AS THE GHOST'S EYES FLOAT BACK TO THEIR CENTER BOX, AND REGENERATE TO CHASE AFTER PAC-MAN AGAIN.

PLAY AS ULYSSES (THE CHARACTER THAT CHARLTON HESTON ORIGINATED), A HUMAN WHO HAS FALLEN TO A POST-APOCALYPTIC EARTH RULED BY PRIMATES.

THE GAME IS PACKED WITH PUZZLES TO SOLVE, AND THE GRAPHICS ARE AMONG THE BEST EVER CREATED FOR THE GAME BOY COLOR. MODES OF PLAY INCLUDE: NORMAL, IN WHICH ULYSSES WALKS FROM LOCATION TO LOCATION; ATHLETIC, IN WHICH THE HERO RUNS AND JUMPS THROUGH EACH LEVEL OF THE STORY; AND STEALTH, WHICH REQUIRES ULYSSES TO CRAWL AND SLINK INTO HIDDEN AREAS NOT ACCESSIBLE IN OTHER MODES.

LEGENDS ALSO SAYS THAT TO BREAK THE SEAL, A HERO MUST COLLECT FIVE POWER STONES THAT ARE GUARDED BY MONSTERS. BOMBERMAN TAKES UP THE CHALLENGE AS HE IS THE LAST HERO STRONG ENOUGH TO DEFEAT SUCH MONSTERS.

THIS IS A SIDE-SCROLLING PLATFORM GAME. IN EACH WORLD, YOU MUST CLEAR FOUR AREAS BY KILLING ANY MONSTERS WITHIN. TO KILL A MONSTER, YOU DROP A BOMB. AFTER A FEW SECONDS, THE BOMB EXPLODES IN A FOUR-WAY BLAST. IF THE MONSTER IS WITHIN RANGE OF THE BLAST, IT IS KILLED. AFTER YOU CLEAR THESE FOUR AREAS, YOU MUST CLEAR A FIFTH AREA BY KILLING A BOSS TO CLEAR THE WORLD AND COLLECT ITS POWER STONE.

BE CAREFUL, THOUGH, BECAUSE IF BOMBERMAN IS TOUCHED BY A MONSTER, TOUCHES A DANGEROUS ITEM OR IS CAUGHT IN THE BLAST OF HIS OWN BOMB, YOU LOSE A LIFE. AFTER ALL LIVES ARE GONE, YOU GET THE OPTION TO RESTART THAT LAST AREA OR QUIT. IN MOST AREAS, YOU CAN, THOUGH THE PLACEMENT OF BOMBS, FIND ITEMS TO INCREASE YOUR JUMPING, SPEED, BLAST RADIUS, ETC.</desc>

YOU'D BETTER BE IN TOP FORM AS YOU COMMAND A KILLER SPACECRAFT OUT INTO ORBIT IN HOPES OF RESCUING HUMANITY FROM UNTHINKABLE MISERY. EACH OF THE EIGHT STAGES IN PROJECT S-11 POSES UNIQUE CHALLENGES, AND EACH SETTING IS MORE HARROWING THAN THE LAST. ALTHOUGH YOU'RE GOING IT ALONE IN THIS ONE, THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF POWER-UPS HIDDEN THROUGHOUT THE GAME TO GIVE THE BOOST YOU'LL NEED TO SURVIVE AND WIPE OUT THE TERRIFYING EXTRA-TERRESTRIALS. YOU'LL BENEFIT FROM A COMPLETE STATISTICAL READOUT THAT ADORNS THE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR SCREEN, KEEPING YOU ABREAST OF ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION: YOUR SCORE, YOUR SHIP'S ARMOR LEVEL, AND THE NUMBER OF BOMBS YOU HAVE STORED UP FOR COMBAT. THE GAME'S FAST-PACED ACTION LOOKS EXCELLENT IN FULL COLOR, AND THE INTENSITY OF IT WILL HAVE YOU BREAKING A SWEAT BEFORE YOU'RE THROUGH THE FIRST LEVEL. THOSE ALIENS HAD BETTER LOOK OUT WITH YOU AT THE CONTROLS, EARTH STANDS A FIGHTING CHANCE.</desc>

		<desc>A MIX BETWEEN CLASSIC "WALLS" AND "BUBBLES" PUZZLES GAMES
12 CHARACTERS TO CHALLENGE
12 GEMS TO WIN
INTENSE COMPETITIONS
4 AMAZING GAME MODES

THE GENERAL OBJECTIVE OF PUCHI CARAT IS TO DESTROY GEM-LIKE BLOCKS USING A BALL AND PADDLE. GEMS "FALL IN" FROM THE TOP OF THE PLAY AREA ONE LINE AT A TIME AND ARE CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER EITHER HORIZONTALLY OR VERTICALLY. HITTING A GEM WITH THE BALL WILL DESTROY IT, AND IF THE DESTROYED GEM CAUSES OTHER GEMS TO NO LONGER BE CONNECTED TO THE TOP OF THE PLAY AREA, THEY FALL OFF, SCORING BONUS POINTS. DESTROYING A SPECIAL FLASHING GEM ALSO DESTROYS ALL REGULAR GEMS OF THE SAME COLOR IN THE PLAYFIELD. THERE ARE ALSO METALLIC BLOCKS THAT TAKE MORE THAN ONE HIT TO DESTROY.

THE PLAYER CONTROLS A PADDLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PLAYFIELD, WHICH CAN MOVE LEFT AND RIGHT TO BOUNCE THE BALL BACK UPWARD. UNLIKE IN MOST OTHER BREAKOUT-STYLE GAMES, MISSING THE BALL DOES NOT COST A LIFE OR END THE GAME, BUT RATHER ADDS MORE LINES OF GEMS TO THE TOP OF THE PLAYFIELD. GEM LINES WILL ADVANCE ON THEIR OWN AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME, AS WELL AS WHEN THE PLAYFIELD IS CLEARED ENTIRELY OR DROPS BELOW A CERTAIN NUMBER OF GEMS. IF THE GEMS ADVANCE ACROSS THE LINE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PLAYFIELD WHERE THE PADDLE RESIDES, THE PLAYER LOSES AND THE GAME IS OVER.

THE ARCADE VERSION OF PUCHI CARAT FEATURES THREE MAIN GAMEPLAY MODES: A SINGLE-PLAYER MODE WHERE THE GOAL IS TO CLEAR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF GEM LINES, A STORY MODE IN WHICH THE PLAYER CHALLENGES EACH CHARACTER IN A HEAD-TO-HEAD BATTLE (WHERE DROPPED GEMS ARE ADDED TO THE OPPONENT'S PLAYFIELD FROM THE BOTTOM), AND A TWO-PLAYER VERSUS MODE FOLLOWING THE SAME RULES AS THE STORY MODE. EACH OF THE SINGLE-PLAYER MODES OFFERS THREE LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY. VARIOUS PORTS OF THE GAME OFFER ADDITIONAL GAMEPLAY MODES (SUCH AS TIME-ATTACK MODE), MORE DIFFICULTY LEVELS, AND EXPANDED STORYLINES FOR EACH CHARACTER.</desc>

		<desc>RAMPAGE WORLD TOUR IS A UPDATED VERSION OF THE CLASSIC RAMPAGE.  RAMPAGE WORLD TOUR STARTS OFF AT SCUMLABS INTERNATIONAL WHERE THREE LAB TECHNICIANS, GEORGE, LIZZY, AND RALPH HAVE MUTATED IN AN ACCIDENT INVOLVING TOXIC WASTE.  GEORGE HAS TURNED INTO A GIGANTIC APE, LIZZY A GIGANTIC LIZARD OR DINOSAUR, AND RALPH SOME SORT OF GIGANTIC WOLF.  THE THREE DESTROY THE LAB THEY PREVIOUSLY WORKED AT AND THEN EMBARK ON A PATH OF DESTRUCTION ENCOMPASSING THE ENTIRE GLOBE.

THE PLAYER CHOOSES ONE OF THESE THREE CHARACTERS AND BEGINS DESTROYING BUILDINGS, EATING CIVILIANS, KNOCKING PLANES OUT OF THE SKY, AND STEPPING ON TANKS.  THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE GAME IS TO RID THE WORLD OF SCUMLABS BY TRAVELING TO THE CITIES WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED.  BEING CREATURES OF SUCH MASSIVE SIZE, THERE ARE MANY CITIES THAT MUST BE DESTROYED ALONG THE WAY.  SCUMLABS AND THE VARIOUS MILITARIES MAKE IT A PRIORITY TO DESTROY YOU AND OPTIONALLY ANOTHER PLAYER THAT CAN PLAY SIMULTANEOUSLY.

THE GRAPHICS ARE WORTH NOTING AS THEY ARE OF A UNIQUE, COLORFUL "CARTOON" FLAVOR.  GAMEPLAY INCLUDES PLAYERS CLIMB BUILDINGS WHILE PUNCHING, KICKING, AND EATING THEIR INHABITANTS TO DESTROY THEM.  ONCE ALL THE BUILDINGS FOR A PARTICULAR STAGE HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, THE STAGE IS CLEAR AND PLAYERS PROCEED TO THE NEXT STAGE.  PLAYERS CAN GET MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF POWER-UPS THAT MAKE THEM MORE POWERFUL OR RESTORE HEALTH.</desc>

THERE ARE FIVE MINI-GAMES TO PLAY; SOME ARE VERSIONS OF CLASSIC KID'S GAMES, BUT WITH A FIRE THEME. ONE IS SIMPLE GAME MEMORY WHERE PLAYERS MUST MATCH PICTURES OF ANIMALS TO RESCUE THEM FROM A FIRE, WHILE ANOTHER IS SIMILAR TO SIMON WHERE PLAYERS MUST MEMORIZE AND REPEAT COLOR COMBINATIONS.

FOR EXAMPLE, ONE GAME CALLS FOR THE PLAYER TO RIDE A JET SKI TO RESCUE PEOPLE STUCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A RIVER AND DROP BUCKETS OF WATER FROM A HELICOPTER. IF YOU HAVE A GAME BOY PRINTER, THE MEDALS AND AWARDS EARNED CAN BE PRINTED. NOW YOU CAN HELP A YOUNG GAMER GET STARTED WITH RESCUE HEROES: FIRE FRENZY.</desc>

		<name>Road Rash</name>
		<desc>ROAD RASH IS AN AGGRESSIVE MOTORCYCLE RACING GAME WHERE THE PLAYER ASSUMES THE ROLE OF A BIKER WHO TAKES PART IN A SERIES OF ILLEGAL RACES ACROSS THE U.S.A. STARTING AT THE BACK OF THE PACK THE OBJECTIVE IS ALWAYS TO FINISH FIRST ON A LINEAR COURSE, OVERTAKING THE OTHER BIKERS. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY DRIVING VERY WELL OR BY PLAYING IT DIRTY, KNOCKING OPPONENTS OF THEIR BIKES USING CLUBS, CROWBARS OR YOUR BARE HANDS. THE OTHER RACERS FIGHT BACK IN A SIMILAR FASHION AND THERE ARE ALSO HAZARDS. ALL THE RACES TAKE PLACE ON THE REGULAR ROAD WITH NORMAL TRAFFIC (IN BOTH DIRECTIONS) AND THE COPS, AS WELL AS OCCASIONAL OIL SLICKS AND STRAY COWS.

BY WINNING RACES YOU CAN GET PROMOTED TO A STRONGER DIVISION AND EARN CASH WITH WHICH YOU CAN BUY A BETTER BIKE. WHENEVER YOU'RE KNOCKED OFF YOUR BIKE OR HIT SOMETHING YOU WILL HAVE TO RUN BACK TO YOUR BIKE AND LOSE VALUABLE TIME, PLUS YOUR BIKE WILL SUFFER SOME DAMAGE. WHEN THE PLAYER CRASHES WITH COPS NEARBY, IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET BUSTED AND THEN YOU HAVE TO FORFEIT THE RACE.

LIKE THE WHOLE ROAD RASH LINEAGE, THE GAME HAS ARCADE-LIKE GAMEPLAY WITH NO INTENTION TO BE A MOTORCYCLE SIMULATION. WHILE THE GAME HAS A TWO-PLAYER MODE, THIS IS NOT SIMULTANEOUS.</desc>

TEAR THROUGH BYDO DEFENSES AS YOU BLAST ENEMIES WITH YOUR FIRE CHAIN, SUPER LASER AND BUBBLE BEAM. TAKE THE FIGHT TO A FEVERED PITCH WITH TWO PULSE-POUNDING RAPID-FIRE MODES ON YOUR GAME BOY COLOR SYSTEM.</desc>

VISUALLY, THEREÂS REALLY NOT MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THIS GAME BOY COLOR VERSION. THE GAME CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF WHITE TILES EACH WITH THEIR OWN LETTER AND VALUE. IS THAT ENOUGH FOR YOU? OH YES. YOU KNOW SCRABBLE. SEVEN RANDOM LETTERS, MAKE A WORD OUT OF 'EM, SCORE POINTS. FALL OUT WITH OPPONENT OPTIONAL. 

SEVEN LETTERED TILES IT IS THEN, WITH WHICH YOU MUST FORMULATE THE HIGHEST SCORING WORD POSSIBLE. CLEARLY, LETTERS SUCH AS Q, X AND Z HAVE A GREATER VALUE, BUT THE NUMBER OF LEGITIMATE WORDS THAT USE THESE LETTERS IS LIMITED. ONCE YOUÂVE CHOSEN YOUR WORD, YOU MUST PLACE IT ON A BOARD IN A HORIZONTAL OR VERTICAL FASHION. CERTAIN SPACES ON THE BOARD CONTAIN SCORE BOOSTERS THAT WILL INCREASE THE VALUE OF YOUR CHOSEN WORD. TRIPLE WORD SCORE IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL. YOUR LETTER SUPPLY WILL THEN BE REPLENISHED AND YOU MUST REPEAT THE PROCESS ONCE YOUR OPPONENT HAS PLACED HIS WORD ON THE BOARD. AT THE END OF THE GAME, WHEN THE SUPPLY OF TILES IS EXHAUSTED, THE HIGHEST SCORING PLAYER WINS. 

SO THERE YOU HAVE IT. ITÂS SCRABBLE ON A HANDHELD, AND ITÂS BRILLIANT.</desc>

		<desc>IN 1978, EARTH SUCCESSFULLY REPULSED AN INVASION FROM OUTER SPACE THANKS TO "THE TANK."  THE TANK WAS BASED ON ALIEN TECHNOLOGY FOUND WHEN A SCOUT SHIP HAD CRASHED YEARS EARLIER.  NOW, OVER 20 YEARS LATER, A NEW TANK HAS BEEN CREATED BASED ON THE TECHNOLOGY RECOVERED DURING THE 1978 INVASION.  AND NONE TOO SOON, BECAUSE THE INVADERS ARE BACK!

SPACE INVADERS IS YET ANOTHER CLASSIC ARCADE GAME REMAKE BY ACTIVISION.  (SEE BATTLEZONE AND ASTEROIDS.)  BUT THIS TIME, ACTIVISION LICENSED A GAME FROM TAITO INSTEAD OF ATARI.  THE GAME STAYS CLOSE TO ITS ROOTS WHILE ADDING MANY POWER-UPS AND ENEMIES.

YOU CAN PLAY EITHER ONE OR TWO PLAYERS AGAINST THE INVADERS, WHO MARCH DOWN THE SCREEN IN ORDERLY ROWS AND COLUMNS, AT ONE OF THREE SKILL LEVELS.  YOU'LL START AT PLUTO AND WORK YOUR WAY THROUGH THE SOLAR SYSTEM TO MARS, THEN VENUS, AND FINALLY EARTH.  THERE ARE FOUR COMMON ALIENS (RED, GREEN, BLUE, AND YELLOW), PLUS SEVEN MORE LESS COMMON ONES.  YOU RECEIVE SPECIAL ONE SHOT POWER-UPS BY SHOOTING FOUR OF THE SAME TYPE OF INVADERS IN A ROW.  AS IN THE ORIGINAL GAME, THERE ARE ALSO MOTHER SHIPS THAT FLY ABOVE THE ACTION, BUT IN THIS VERSION IF YOU HIT THEM YOU CAN PICK UP OTHER USEFUL POWER-UPS LIKE SHIELDS OR DOUBLE SHOTS.  PLUS, AFTER FIGHTING OFF SEVERAL WAVES ON EACH PLANET, YOU'LL FACE A UNIQUE BOSS.  IF YOU MANAGE TO FINISH THE GAME, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PLAY A REPRODUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL COIN-OP.</desc>

SPACE MARAUDER IS AN SCROLLING SHOOTER GAME WITH TWO MODES OF PLAY. MOST LEVELS ARE SIDE- AND VERTICAL-SCROLLING WITH PRE-DESIGNED LAYOUTS. A FEW LEVELS ARE DIFFERENT, THOUGH: TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE, WITH A RANDOMIZED LAYOUT. EITHER WAY, THE PLAYER IS ARMED WITH A VARIETY OF WEAPONS, INCLUDING DIFFERENT GUNS (LASER, MISSILE, RING) AND THE POWERFUL COBALT BOMB WHICH KILLS EVERYTHING ON SCREEN.

SPACE MARAUDER IS THE GAME BOY COLOR VERSION OF BURAI FIGHTER. GAME PLAY IS EXACTLY THE SAME. LIKE BURAI FIGHTER IT OFFERS THE SAME THREE DIFFICULTIES (EAGLE, ALBATROSS AND ACE), BUT THE GAME FEATURES DIFFERENT LEVEL LAYOUTS. IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE VS. MODE.</desc>

		<desc>SPACE STATION SILICON VALLEY IS A BASED ON THE NINTENDO 64 GAME OF THE SAME NAME. IT KEEPS STORY, GAMEPLAY MECHANICS AND EVEN THE BASIC LEVEL DESIGN WHILE TRANSLATING EVERYTHING INTO A PLATFORMING PERSPECTIVE SHOWN FROM THE SIDE. 

THE STORY IS ABOUT A SPACE STATION WHICH IS POPULATED BY INDEPENDENT ROBOT ANIMALS. A WHILE AGO THE STATION VANISHED BUT NOW IT IS BACK ON FULL COLLISION COURSE TOWARDS EARTH. OF COURSE HUMANITY SENDS SQUADS OUT THERE TO END THE THREAT, BUT EVERYONE BUT THE ROBOT EVO GETS LOST. THE PLAYER TAKES THE ROLE OF EVO WHO HAS TO SOLVE 35 LEVELS IN ORDER TO SAVE EARTH.

THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE GAME IS THAT EVO HAS THE ABILITY TO TAKE CONTROL OVER ANY ROBOT ANIMAL HE MEETS. IN FACT, HE IS REQUIRED TO DO SO BECAUSE HIS LIFE ENERGY RAPIDLY DECREASES WHEN OUTSIDE OF A HOST. ALL THOSE ANIMALS HAVE DIFFERENT ABILITIES WHICH ARE USED TO SOLVE THE NUMEROUS PUZZLES FOUND IN THE LEVELS. THERE ARE VARYING GOALS TO COMPLETE IN EACH LEVEL WHICH RANGE FROM DESTROYING A MACHINE TO GUIDING SHEEP TO THEIR PENS.</desc>

SPAWN IS A PLATFORMER WITH SOME SHOOTER ELEMENTS.  IT CONTAINS BOTH HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL SECTIONS.  YOU MUST MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH THESE AND DEFEAT THE VARIOUS THUGS AND OCCASIONAL BOSSES.  MOSTLY, YOU'LL BE PUNCHING AND KICKING, BUT THERE ARE SOME GUNS WITH RATHER LIMITED AMMUNITION TO FIND ALONG THE WAY.  THERE IS ALSO ONE STAGE WHERE SPAWN RIDS A MOTORCYCLE, SOMEWHAT ALONG THE LINES OF THE SURFING AND SKATING LEVELS IN TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES.

THERE ARE THREE DIFFICULTY MODES.  IN EACH MODE, ENEMIES CAN TAKE MORE DAMAGE.  ONE PUNCH WILL KNOCK OUT ANY MINOR ENEMY IN EASY AND YOU CAN START AT ANY STAGE.  IT TAKES TWO IN NORMAL AND YOU MUST PLAY THROUGH FROM STAGE ONE.  ON HARD, IT TAKES SEVERAL, SO THE FIGHTING BECOMES MUCH MORE STRATEGIC.  YOU MUST BEAT THE GAME ON HARD MODE TO GET THE REAL ENDING.</desc>

THE GAME IS A PLATFORMER, DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL LARGE LEVELS. PROGRESSION IS NOT STRICTLY LINEAR: SOME OF THE LEVELS CAN BE FREELY EXPLORED IN ANY ORDER BEFORE CONTINUING WITH THE STORY. LOCATIONS INCLUDE THE CITY, SUBWAY AND SEWERS, THE DOCKS AND A WAREHOUSE. THE LEVELS ARE USUALLY CRAWLING WITH ENEMIES THAT SPIDER-MAN CAN BEAT UP WITH KICKS AND PUNCHES. DEFEATING THEM WILL EVENTUALLY RESULT IN HIM GAINING LEVELS, BECOMING STRONGER AND LEARNING SOME NEW FIGHTING MOVES.

SPIDEY'S SPECIAL ABILITIES COME INTO PLAY WHEN HE SWINGS FREELY OVER THE ROOFTOPS, CLINGS TO WALLS OR THROWS WEB BALLS AT ENEMIES TO IMMOBILIZE THEM. HIS SPIDER-SENSE WILL USUALLY ALERT HIM WHEN IMPORTANT LOCATIONS OR SPECIAL OBSTACLES ARE NEAR.

THE GAME INCLUDES VARIOUS BOSS FIGHTS WITH THE LIKES OF VENOM, THE LIZARD AND THE HOBGOBLIN.</desc>

		<desc>WHEN ON A PLEASURE CRUISE FOR HIS TENTH BIRTHDAY, A YOUNG BOY IS SWEPT CASTAWAY TO A REMOTE ISLAND BY A FIERCE STORM THAT DESTROYS THE ENTIRE SHIP.  WITH NO FAMILY OR FRIENDS, HE MUST FEND FOR HIMSELF ON THIS STRANGE, SEEMINGLY UNINHABITED ISLAND AND ULTIMATELY FIND A WAY TO RETURN HOME.

SURVIVAL KIDS IS PRESENTED IN AN OVERHEAD ACTION-RPG STYLE SIMILAR TO LINK'S AWAKENING.  PLAYERS MUST TRY TO SURVIVE THROUGH EACH DAY BY GETTING ENOUGH REST, EATING FOOD AND DRINKING WATER REGULARLY.  THIS CAN BE RISKY, AS CERTAIN FOODS SUCH AS MUSHROOMS CAN HAVE VARYING EFFECTS INCLUDING PARALYSIS AND POISON, WHILE OTHER FOODS CAN GO ROTTEN AND MAKE YOU SICK IF YOU EAT IT.

THE GAME ALSO FEATURES A UNIQUE "MERGE" SYSTEM, WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ITEMS BY COMBINING TWO OTHER ITEMS.  FOR EXAMPLE, COMBINING BARK AND A STICK WOULD PRODUCE KINDLING, WHILE USING IVY WITH A BENT STICK COULD CREATE A BOW.  THERE ARE PLENTY OF USELESS ITEMS THAT CAN BE MADE IN ADDITION TO THE ESSENTIALS, SO IT'S UP TO THE PLAYER TO THINK AS TO WHAT COULD BE HELPFUL IN THEIR QUEST TO SURVIVE.</desc>

THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS TO CHOOSE FROM, RICK O'CONNEL, EVELYN O'CONNEL AND ARDETH BAY THAT THEY CAN CHOOSE AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH STAGE, EACH WITH THEIR OWN STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES AND DEPENDING ON WHICH CHARACTER THEY PICK WILL DETERMINE WHICH STAGE LAYOUT WILL BE PRESENT (EX.

THE LIMITATIONS OF THE PLATFORM ARE NOT TRADED IN FOR AN ARCADE-LIKE APPROACH. JUST LIKE THE MAJOR COMPUTER VERSION IT STRESSES CAREFUL PLANNING AND TACTICS. AFTER A BRIEFING THAT NEEDS TO BE FOLLOWED ATTENTIVELY, THE PLAYER ASSUMES THE ROLE OF THE COMMANDER AND ASSEMBLES A SQUAD OF EIGHT OPERATIVES, EACH WITH DIFFERENT STATISTICS AND ABILITIES, BASED ON CHARACTER TRAITS SUCH AS AGGRESSION AND SELF-CONTROL, PHYSICAL ELEMENTS SUCH AS STAMINA, AND SPECIFIC SKILLS INCLUDING STEALTH, FIREARMS, ELECTRONICS, DEMOLITIONS AND MANY OTHER TYPES OF WEAPONS. THEY CAN BE DIVIDED INTO UP TO FOUR INDEPENDENT TEAMS. NEXT, THE OPERATIVES ARE OUTFITTED WITH A SELECTION OF SIX DIFFERENT RIFLES, SIX DIFFERENT HANDGUNS, 24 TYPES OF ARMOR OR CAMOUFLAGE AND ADDITIONAL TOOLS INCLUDING HEARTBEAT SENSORS AND DOOR CHARGES. DEFAULT EQUIPMENT IS SUGGESTED RIGHT AWAY, BUT THAT IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR LATER MISSIONS. IN THE PLANNING MODE, THE LAST PART OF THE PRE-MISSION ACTIVITIES, THE COMMANDER NEEDS TO SET OUT WAYPOINTS ON THE MAP AND DETERMINE THE COURSE OF ACTION.

THE ACTUAL MISSIONS ARE SHOWN IN 2D WHERE THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS CAN SNEAK AROUND, BLOW UP DOORS, RESCUE HOSTAGES AND ENGAGE THE ENEMY, ALL REQUIRING A TACTICAL APPROACH. THE GENERAL PLOT POINTS AND MISSION OBJECTIVES ARE TRUE TO THE COMPUTER VERSION.</desc>

		<name>Wendy: Every Witch Way</name>
		<desc>WHILE EXPLORING HER HOUSE'S ATTIC, THE LITTLE WITCH WENDY DISCOVERS A TREASURE CHEST.  UPON OPENING IT, MAGICAL STONES ARE RELEASED FROM THEIR PRISON, AND HEAD TO A CASTLE WHICH IS SUSPENDED IN THE SKY. THE POWER OF THE STONES UPSETS GRAVITY, AND THE CASTLE COMES CRASHING TO THE GROUND, RIGHT ON TOP OF WENDY'S HOUSE!  IT'S UP TO WENDY TO SET THINGS RIGHT AGAIN!

WENDY: EVERY WITCH WAY IS A COMBINATION OF A SIDE-SCROLLING PLATFORMER AND A PUZZLE GAME.  AS WENDY, PLAYERS EXPLORE THE CASTLE IN SEARCH OF THE TROUBLESOME STONES THAT HAVE UPSET GRAVITY.  WENDY HAS THE ABILITY TO CONTROL GRAVITY HERSELF  BY PRESSING UP OR DOWN ON THE CONTROL PAD WHILE JUMPING, WENDY WILL CAUSE GRAVITY TO REVERSE IN THAT DIRECTION.  MOST ENEMIES AND OBSTACLES IN THE GAME WORLD ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY THE GRAVITY SWITCHING  YOU'LL NEED TO MANIPULATE GRAVITY FREQUENTLY TO PROGRESS THROUGH THE GAME'S DIFFERENT PUZZLES.

STARS CAN BE USED TO POWER UP WENDY'S MAGIC.  FOR EVERY STAR THAT SHE COLLECTS (TO A MAXIMUM OF FIVE), HER MAGIC WILL INCREASE.  BEGINNING WITH A SMALL WEAK SHOT, YOU CAN POWER YOUR MAGIC UP TO A SPREAD SHOT THAT FIRES IN THREE DIRECTIONS.  THE STARS ALSO ACT AS WENDY'S HEALTH METER  IF YOU GET HIT, YOU'LL LOSE A STAR, AS WELL AS SOME MAGICAL POWER.  GET HIT WHEN YOU HAVE NO STARS LEFT, AND YOU'LL LOSE A LIFE.

AT THE END OF EVERY WORLD, THERE IS A SHORT BONUS STAGE WITH WENDY RIDING ON HER BROOMSTICK.  IN THESE STAGES, YOU MUST ATTACK ENEMIES AND COLLECT STARS AS WENDY AUTOMATICALLY FLIES TO THE NEXT WORLD.</desc>

YOU START EACH MISSION BY TAKING OFF FROM AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER, WHICH YOU'LL HAVE TO PROTECT FROM ASSAULTS BY JAPANESE TORPEDO PLANES. WHENEVER YOU RUN OUT OF FUEL, BOMBS, ROCKETS OR MACHINE GUN AMMO YOU CAN REPLENISH THOSE BY RETURNING TO YOUR CARRIER. YOUR CARRIER IS ALSO THE PLACE TO REPAIR DAMAGE TO YOUR PLANE.

THE GAMEBOY COLOR VERSION OF WINGS OF FURY HAS A TONED DOWN VIOLENCE LEVEL. YOU NO LONGER MOW DOWN JAPANESE SOLDIERS WITH YOUR MACHINE GUNS, INSTEAD YOU BOMBARD JEEPS &amp; TRUCKS. ALSO MISSING IN THIS VERSION ARE THE JAPANESE TORPEDO PLANES AND THE SMALL 1ST-PERSON VIEW WINDOW.

FOR THOSE WHO'VE NEVER PLAYED WORMS, IT'S AT HEART SIMILAR TO THE OLD GAME ARTILLERY, WHICH YOU CONTROL AN ARTILLERY PIECE. IN ESSENCE, YOU GIVE IT A SHOT ANGLE AND SHOT POWER, AND TRY TO HIT YOUR ENEMY, DESPITE WIND EFFECTS AND THE ENEMY FIRING BACK AT YOU. WORMS PUTS YOU IN COMMAND OF A TEAM OF WORMS, BUT NOT ONLY CAN YOU MOVE AROUND THE LANDSCAPE, YOU CAN USE MANY TYPES OF WEAPONS TO TRY TO DISPATCH THE ENEMY, FROM BAZOOKAS TO MINI-GUNS TO EXPLODING SHEEP. 

EVERYTHING IS PRESENTED IN A HUMOROUS CARTOONISH STYLE, FROM THE LANDSCAPES TO THE WORMS THEMSELVES AND THEIR CRIES OF TRIUMPH OR DESPAIR, DEPENDING ON HOW YOU DO.

ARMAGEDDON USES AN ENHANCED VERSION OF THE WORMS 2 ENGINE, AND WHILE AN IMPROVEMENT OVER WORMS 2, IT'S NOT A HUGE CHANGE.</desc>

XTREME WHEELS IS PACKED WITH VARIED HILLS, JUMPS, AND TERRAIN, SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO START OFF IN EXCLUSIVE TRAINING MODE TO GET A GRIP ON THE HANDLING AND REALISTIC PHYSICS THAT THE GAME ENGINE DELIVERS. IF YOU WANT TO BE THE ULTIMATE XTREME RACER, YOU'D BETTER GET CRACKING.</desc>

		<name>Yogi Bear : Great Balloon Blast</name>
		<desc>IT'S THE 14TH ANNUAL JELLYSTONE PARK BALLOON FEST. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS FOR YOGI...CAMPERS WITH PIC-A-NIC BASKETS! YOGI HAS A PLAN TO GET THOSE BASKETS. HE'LL POSE AS A BALLOON SALESMAN. HE JUST NEEDS TO AVOID RANGER SMITH.

BOO BOO: "BUT, YOGI, THE RANGER ISN'T GOING TO LIKE THIS."
YOGI: "NOT TO WORRY, BOO BOO, I'M SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE BEAR!"

THIS IS A PUZZLE GAME REQUIRING STRATEGY. A CLOUD ABOVE WILL HOLD SEVERAL COLORED BALLOONS WHILE MOVING LEFT OR RIGHT. WHEN IT REACHES THE SCREEN EDGE, IT DROPS DOWN A BIT. YOU HAVE A PICNIC BASKET WITH TWO BALLOONS ATTACHED. BY PRESSING THE B BUTTON, YOU CAN ROTATE THE BALLOONS 90º AND SWAP THE COLORS. BY PRESSING THE A BUTTON, YOU RELEASE THE BALLOONS. THE OBJECT IS TO GET THREE BALLOONS OF THE SAME COLOR TO TOUCH. THEY WILL THEN POP AND WILL BE GONE. REMEMBER, THE CLOUD IS MOVING SO TIME YOUR RELEASE SO THE BALLOONS GO WHERE YOU WANT. YOU ARE TRYING TO CLEAR ALL THE BALLOONS TO MOVE ON.

EVERY FOURTH LEVEL IS A BOSS LEVEL WHERE YOU HAVE RANGER SMITH ON TOP OF THE CLOUD. HE STOMPS THE CLOUD TO LOWER IT AND DROPS A STONE. IF THE STONE HITS YOUR BASKET, YOU WILL RELEASE YOUR BALLOONS, WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT, AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE FOR A COUPLE SECONDS. ONCE YOU CLEAR ALL THESE BALLOONS, YOU WILL HAVE DEFEATED RANGER SMITH AND WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT AREA. IF YOU MATCH A BALLOON WITH AN ARROW IN IT, THE CLOUD WILL MOVE UP A LITTLE. IF THE BALLOONS REACH THE BOTTOM, YOU LOSE. YOU CAN THEN CHOOSE TO RESTART THE LEVEL YOU WERE ON OR END THE GAME.</desc>

		<name>Zebco Fishing!</name>
		<desc>ZEBCO FISHING! IS AN OFFICIALLY LICENSED FISHING GAME FOR THE GAME BOY COLOR. IT FEATURES 11 DIFFERENT LURES AND 2 LAKES TO FISH ON. THE PLAYER CAN PARTICIPATE IN A TOURNAMENT AND BLACKJACK BASS. THE TOURNAMENT MODE GIVES YOU A LIMITED TIME TO CATCH THE BIGGEST FISH. IN BLACKJACK BASS YOU HAVE TO CATCH 21 POUNDS WORTH OF FISH, SIMILAR TO THE GAME BLACK JACK. EACH TIME YOU CATCH A FISH, YOU GET ITS WEIGHT AND CAN DECIDE TO "HIT" OR "HOLD". IF YOU EXCEED THE 21 POUNDS YOU LOSE.

THE PLAYER CAN ROW HIS BOAT AROUND THE LAKE UNTIL HE HAS FOUND A SUITABLE FISHING LOCATION, WHERE HE CAN CAST HIS LINE AND WAIT FOR THE FISH TO BITE. ONCE A FISH IS NIBBLING THE BAIT THE PLAYER HAS TO HOOK IT AND THEN REEL IT IN. WHEN YOU DO SO YOU MUST MAKE SURE YOUR LINE DOESN'T BREAK BY KEEPING AN EYE ON THE TENSION. 

WEATHER CONDITIONS, TIME OF DAY AND LOCATION ALL HAVE IMPACT ON THE CHANCE OF CATCHING A FISH. EACH TYPE OF LURE ALSO IMPROVES THE ODDS IN SPECIFIC TYPES OF WATER AND WEATHER TYPES. SOMEWHERE IN THE TWO LAKES ALSO DWELLS THE LEGENDARY LOCHNESS BASS A GIANT FISH WHICH IS YET TO BE CAUGHT.</desc>

		<desc>A TALKING LEMUR? THE ONLY PLACE YOU MIGHT FIND SUCH A THING IS ZOBOOLAND, THE MAGICAL PLACE FROM THE PBS SERIES ZOBOOMAFOO. EMBARK ON A NINE-LEVEL QUEST TO COLLECT AS MANY ANIMAL FRIEND CARDS AS POSSIBLE, A TASK THAT WILL REQUIRE LOTS OF INTERACTION AND COOPERATION WITH OTHER CREATURES. MAKE YOUR WAY ACROSS EACH SIDE-SCROLLING LEVEL, TRYING TO KEEP YOUR ENERGY UP BY EATING GOOBLEBERRIES. IF YOU DON'T EAT ENOUGH, YOU'LL RUN OUT OF ENERGY AND FALL ASLEEP LOSING ONE TURN. COLLECTING 100 GOOBLEBERRIES WILL EARN YOU AN EXTRA SHOT AT COMPLETING THE GAME, BUT THAT WON'T BE EASY WITH SO MANY OTHER TASKS TO KEEP YOUR MIND ON. THE GAME IS CERTAINLY DESIGNED FOR YOUNGER PLAYERS, BUT THREE SKILL SETTINGS (EASY, EASIER, EASIEST) ALLOW THE GAME'S DIFFICULTY TO EXPAND AS KIDS GROW ACCUSTOMED TO THE CHALLENGES. THOUGH THE JOURNEY IS LONG, GAMES CAN BE SAVED WITH THE USE OF A PASSWORD.</desc>
