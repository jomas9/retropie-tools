		<name>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure</name>
		<desc>THE LYNX TITLE BASED ON THE KEANU REEVES/ALEX WINTER FILM FRANCHISE ACTUALLY TAKES PLACE AFTER THE SECOND FILM, BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY. OUT FOR REVENGE AFTER BEING HUMILIATED BY THE HIGH-SCHOOL DUO, DEATH KIDNAPS THEIR "MEDIEVAL BABE" GIRLFRIENDS FROM THE FIRST FILM, AND DRAGS THEM THROUGHOUT HISTORY.  LUCKILY, THE GIRLS ARE ABLE TO LEAVE BEHIND PAGES OF THE BAND'S LATEST SONG AS A TRAIL FOR BILL AND TED TO FOLLOW.

PLAYING AS EITHER BILL OR TED (WITH A FRIEND ABLE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE OTHER CHARACTER OVER COMLYNX), THE PLAYER MUST SEARCH HISTORICAL PERIODS IN AN OVERHEAD PERSPECTIVE AND COLLECT ENOUGH MUSICAL NOTES TO OPEN TRAVEL TO A NEW AREA. ALONG THE WAY, THEY CAN ENCOUNTER HISTORICAL FIGURES WHO WILL OFFER ASSISTANCE IN RETURN FOR A FAVOR.  BAD GUYS DO POPULATE THE LEVELS, BUT CAN BE PACIFIED WITH A RIPPIN' GUITAR SOLO.  IF BILL OR TED ARE DEFEATED, THEY SIMPLY REAPPEAR BACK AT THE LAST CHECKPOINT.

OTHER ITEMS CAN BE FOUND AND COLLECTED IN AN INVENTORY. THE LYNX TITLE MAKES USE OF THE SERIES' INTERESTING TAKE ON THE TIME CONTINUUM, ALLOWING THE PLAYER TO LEAVE ITEMS FOR THEMSELVES IN THE PAST TO COLLECT AND USE IN THE FUTURE.  LIKEWISE, IF THE PLAYER HAPPENS UPON A SUDDEN FORTUITOUS ITEM THAT "THEY" LEFT, THEY MUST REMEMBER TO GO AND LEAVE THE ITEM IN THE PAST THEMSELVES TO AVOID CREATING A TIME PARADOX. THIS QUIRKY VIEW OF TIME FORMS THE BASIS OF MANY OF THE GAME'S PUZZLES.

A PASSWORD SYSTEM IS CONSTANTLY UPDATED (VIEWABLE AT THE PAUSE SCREEN) TO SAVE THE PLAYER'S PROGRESS.</desc>

YOU MUST LOCATE THE CORRECT TYPE OF RADIOACTIVE PARTICLES TO MOVE FROM WORLD TO WORLD AND FINALLY HOME, BEFORE THE HOSTILE DENIZENS OF THESE WORLDS BURST YOUR BUBBLE.

YOU MOVE YOUR BUBBLE BY PUSHING IN THE DESIRED DIRECTION. BE ADVISED THAT YOU DO NOT STOP EASILY AND CAN BOUNCE OUT OF CONTROL IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL. PUSHING THE A BUTTON FIRES A BUBBLE SHOT THAT WILL RICOCHET AROUND. YOU CAN USE THIS ACTION TO BOUNCE SHOTS AT ENEMIES THAT ARE AROUND A CORNER. PRESSING B DROPS A BUBBLE BOMB STRAIGHT DOWN. PRESSING OPTION 1 SWITCHES OPTIONS ON THE SCREEN, INCLUDING THE SUICIDAL "BURST!!!", THAT ARE THEN ACTIVATED BY PRESSING OPTION 2. THE ONE YOU WILL USE MOST IS "USE SCANNER". THIS WILL BRING UP THE SCANNER THAT LOOKS LIKE A RADAR SCREEN AND WILL SHOW YOU THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF YOUR NEEDED PARTICLES. ONCE YOU LOCATE AND GATHER ALL THE PARTICLES NEEDED IN THE LEVEL, YOU MOVE ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL. AFTER YOU FINISH FIVE LEVELS, YOU WIN THE GAME.</desc>

HOWEVER, IN THE NEAR FUTURE, THE EXPLANATION IS THAT SHE'S BEEN KIDNAPPED BY A CRIMINAL BRAIN ROBOT, AND HELD IN A BOOBY-TRAPPED LAIR. AS THE ADVANCED HYBRID ELECTROCOP, YOUR TASK IS TO RESCUE HER WITHIN AN HOUR.

GAMEPLAY INVOLVES WORKING YOUR WAY THROUGH THE COMPLEX WAREHOUSE MAZE, UNLOCKING CODED DOOR ALONG THE WAY. EXTRA WEAPONS CAN BE COLLECTED TO HELP DEALING WITH THE DRONES. THERE ARE ALSO COMPUTER TERMINALS TO BUY NEW WEAPONS - THESE ALSO HAVE SIMPLE SUBGAMES BUILT IN. WHAT MAKES THE GAME UNIQUE, AND INTENDED AS A SHOWPIECE FOR THE LYNX HARDWARE, IS THAT FULL 3D IS USED, SO THAT THE CHARACTER WALKS IN AND OUT OF THE SCREEN AS WELL AS ACROSS IT.</desc>

		<desc>HARD DRIVIN' IS A 3D ARCADE HIT FROM ATARI GAMES. YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SPORTS CAR. YOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO RACE AROUND THE COURSE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND HIT AS MANY CHECKPOINTS AS POSSIBLE. IF YOU HIT A CHECKPOINT YOU GAIN EXTRA TIME TO GO FARTHER. YOU WILL SEE TRAFFIC ON THE ROAD BOTH IN YOUR DIRECTION AND COMING DOWN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, SO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU PASS... 

THE COURSE HAS TWO SECTIONS: SPEED TRACK, AND STUNT TRACK. SPEED TRACK IS LONGER, BUT YOU CAN USUALLY ACHIEVE HIGHER SPEEDS. STUNT TRACK REQUIRES YOU TO PERFORM SEVERAL STUNTS SUCH AS JUMPING BRIDGES, DRIVING THROUGH A LOOP, AND SO ON. 

CRASHING THE CAR HAS NO SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES AND INDEED SHOWS A REPLAY OF YOUR CRASH FROM A CINEMATIC ANGLE. ADMIRE YOUR CRASH HEAD-ON INTO THE CEMENT TRUCK, OR CLIPPING THE MINIVAN, OR FLYING OFF THE BRIDGE IN THE WRONG ANGLE... YOU LOSE SEVERAL SECONDS AS YOUR CAR IS "RESET" AND YOU GET UP TO SPEED AGAIN. 

THE HOME CONVERSIONS RETAIN MOST OF THE THEN-ADVANCED 3D GRAPHICS BUT LACK THE FORCE-FEEDBACK THAT WAS IN THE ARCADE VERSION.</desc>

		<name>Ms. Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>IN 1982, A SEQUEL TO THE  INCREDIBLY POPULAR PAC-MAN WAS INTRODUCED IN THE FORM OF HIS GIRLFRIEND, MS. PAC-MAN.  THIS SEQUEL CONTINUED ON THE "EAT THE DOTS/AVOID THE GHOSTS" GAMEPLAY OF THE ORIGINAL GAME, BUT ADDED NEW FEATURES TO KEEP THE TITLE FRESH.

LIKE HER BOYFRIEND, MS. PAC-MAN ATTEMPTS TO CLEAR FOUR VARIOUS AND CHALLENGING MAZES FILLED WITH DOTS AND EVER-MOVING BOUNCING FRUIT  WHILE AVOIDING INKY, BLINKY, PINKY AND SUE, EACH WITH THEIR OWN PERSONALITIES AND TACTICS.  ONE TOUCH FROM ANY OF THESE GHOSTS MEANS A LOSS OF LIFE FOR MS. PAC-MAN.

MS. PAC-MAN CAN TURN THE TABLES ON HER PURSUERS BY EATING ONE OF THE FOUR ENERGIZERS LOCATED WITHIN THE MAZE. DURING THIS TIME, THE GHOSTS TURN BLUE, AND MS. PAC-MAN CAN EAT THEM FOR BONUS POINTS (RANGING FROM 200, 400, 800 AND 1600, PROGRESSIVELY). THE ENERGIZER POWER ONLY LASTS FOR A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME, AS THE GHOST'S EYES FLOAT BACK TO THEIR CENTER BOX, AND REGENERATE TO CHASE AFTER MS. PAC-MAN AGAIN.

SURVIVE A FEW ROUNDS OF GAMEPLAY, AND THE PLAYER WILL BE TREATED TO HUMOROUS INTERMISSIONS SHOWING THE GROWING ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAC-MAN AND MS. PAC-MAN, LEADING ALL THE WAY UP TO THE ARRIVAL OF "JUNIOR".</desc>

WHEN RYU LEARNS OF THIS, HE EMBARKS ON A QUEST TO FIND OUT WHO KILLED HIS FATHER AND WHY. THIS QUEST TAKES HIM TO AMERICA TO FIND AN ARCHAEOLOGIST WITH WHOM RYU'S FATHER WAS WORKING. FROM THERE, RYU BECOMES EMBROILED IN AN EVIL, SUPERNATURAL CONSPIRACY INVOLVING A VILLAIN NAMED JAQUIO WHO HAS PLANS TO USE AN ANCIENT CASTLE AND SOME RELICS TO UNLEASH A TERRIFYING EVIL UPON THE WORLD.

NINJA GAIDEN IS A SIDE SCROLLING GAME WHERE RYU THE NINJA CAN RUN, JUMP, AND SLASH WITH HIS NINJA SWORD. HE CAN ALSO ATTACH TO ANY VERTICAL SURFACE. POWERUPS ARE LITTERED THROUGHOUT THE LANDSCAPE THAT ALLOW RYU TO TOSS FIREBALLS AND NINJA STARS, AND PERFORM OTHER FEATS.

RYU WILL BATTLE THROUGH URBAN CITY SETTINGS, FORESTS, JUNGLES, SNOW COVERED CASTLES, UNDERGROUND RAILROADS, AND ANCIENT CASTLES. A MAJOR FEATURE IN NINJA GAIDEN ARE THE CINEMATIC SCENES -- SOMETIMES FULLSCREEN -- THROUGH WHICH THE STORYLINE UNFOLDS.</desc>

		<name>Power Factor</name>
		<desc>POWER FACTOR IS AN ACTION-PLATFORMER STARRING THE SINGLE CAMPILY-NAMED HERO, REDD ACE, FIGHTING ALIEN CREATURES KNOWN AS THE CEEGARIANS FROM THE CEEG DIMENSION.  OF COURSE, ALIENS BEING PLAYED OUT, THE CEEGARIANS ARE ACTUALLY REFERRED TO AS "TRANSDIMENSIONAL INTRUDERS," AND THE CEEGARIAN CREATURES THE PLAYER FACES OFF AGAINST ARE REFERRED TO AS EVIL INVADING "SINLENDO TECHMODS."  

THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE GAME IS TO WORK THROUGH STAGES AND BOSSES ESSENTIALLY TO BUILD A BOMB TO DESTROY THE CEEGARIANS. PERTAINING TO THE BOMB, THERE ARE SIX COMPONENTS.  THE ENTIRE GAME TAKES PLACE WITHIN, AS THE BOX REFERS TO IT, "OUR DIMENSION'S REACTOR."  AS SUCH, THE ENVIRONMENTS OF THE GAME ARE AIMED TO LOOK LIKE THE INSIDE OF A MACHINE.  TO FURTHER CONVOLUTE THE STORYLINE, THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL ACTUALLY REFERS TO THE GAME ITSELF AS A VIRTUAL REALITY SIMULATION THE PLAYER IS EXPERIENCING IN THE FUTURE, BASED ON THE EXPLOITS OF REDD ACE, AND YOURE MEANDERING THROUGH THIS SIMULATOR ON THE FAMOUS ATARIAN LEISURE MOON.  

STAGES ARE FAIRLY SMALL, BUT DESIGNED LIKE A MAZE À LA METROID.  HOWEVER, UNLIKE METROID, COMPLETED AREAS CANNOT BE REVISITED.  EACH STAGE ENDS WITH A BOSS BATTLE SHOWCASING ENEMY CHARACTERS THAT ARE OFTEN TWO SCREENS HIGH.

REDD ACE IS ARMED WITH A MULTI-USE WEAPON KNOWN AS THE "TMAT MOW."  TMAT MOW IS INTENDED TO BE SHORT FOR TRANSMAT MULTI-ORDINANCE WEAPON.  FOUR DIFFERENT WEAPONS MAY BE ACQUIRED AND USED FOR BOTH THE A AND B BUTTONS, WITH EIGHT TOTAL WEAPONS IN THE GAME, AND ONE GUN AS A STANDARD.  OTHER WEAPONS INCLUDE LASERS, A FLAME THROWER, MISSILES, BOMBS, AND THE LIKE.  WEAPONS MUST BE PICKED UP THROUGH PLAYING THE STAGES AND COLLECTING VARIOUS WEAPON ICONS.  ONCE THE AMMUNITION IS USED, THE WEAPON IS GONE AND MUST BE RECOLLECTED.  AS SUCH, WEAPON PICK-UPS MUST BE USED SPARINGLY, ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST CONTAIN VERY SMALL NUMBERS OF AMMUNITION, OFTEN AS LOW AS TWO SHOTS.  CHOOSING WEAPONS IS AWKWARDLY ASSIGNED TO THE DIRECTIONAL-PAD, WHICH IS ALSO WHERE CHARACTER MOVEMENT IS ASSIGNED.  TAPPING THE D-PAD ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO SELECT DIFFERENT WEAPONS, WHILE HOLDING IT DOWN MOVES REDD.

CONTROLLING REDD ACE IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM A TYPICAL PLATFORMER OF THE ERA. THERE IS NO JUMP BUTTON, AS BOTH THE A AND B BUTTONS HAVE WEAPONS ASSIGNED TO THEM.  INSTEAD, OUR HERO IS ALSO ARMED WITH A LEVITATION PACK ON HIS BACK, WHICH ALLOWS FLIGHT.  TAPPING "UP" ON THE D-PAD ALLOWS REDD TO JUMP, WHILE HOLDING "UP" ACTIVATES THE LEVITATOR AND ALLOWS REDD TO FLY.  ASIDE FROM A HEALTH BAR, THERE IS ALSO A FUEL BAR SHOWING THAT FLIGHT ISN'T A LUXURY TO BE WASTED.  WHEN CROUCHING, REDD AUTOMATICALLY AIMS UPWARDS AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE, RATHER THAN STRAIGHT AHEAD.

PRESSING THE "OPTION 2" BUTTON ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO SEE A MENU WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE BOMB PIECES THE PLAYER IS COLLECTING, AS WELL AS DETAILS ON THE VARIOUS WEAPONS.  IF THE PLAYER IS STANDING IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER MONITOR WHEN OPTION 2 IS PRESSED, THE MENU SHOWS A MAP OF THE CURRENT AREA, AND INFORMATION ON ENEMY CHARACTERS.

THE PLAYER STARTS WITH THREE LIVES, AND THERE ARE NO CONTINUES.  THERE ARE, HOWEVER, THREE DIFFICULTY MODES--EASY, NORMAL, AND HARDWHICH MAY BE SELECTED PRIOR TO GAMEPLAY.</desc>

		<name>S.T.U.N. Runner</name>
		<desc>BASED ON THE 1989 ATARI GAMES (NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH ATARI CORPORATION, PRODUCERS OF THE LYNX) COIN-OP BY ED ROTBERG.  IT'S 2492 AND YOU MUST PILOT YOUR SUB-TERRANEAN UNDERGROUND NETWORK (S.T.U.N.) CRAFT AT SPEEDS OVER 900 MILES PER HOUR THROUGH A SERIES OF COURSES TO RETAIN YOUR TITLE AS S.T.U.N. RUNNER, COMPLETING EACH COURSE BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT.

THERE ARE ALSO ENEMIES ON EACH COURSE, SUCH AS CYCLES, INDESTRUCTIBLE ARMORED DRONES, AND FLYING BIRD-LIKE CRAFT.  SHOOT OR AVOID THEM.  IF YOU HIT THEM, YOU LOSE ONE OF YOUR SHIELDS (YOUR CRAFT HAS SIX TOTAL) AND ARE SLOWED DOWN TEMPORARILY.  THE MORE SHIELDS YOU HAVE AT THE FINISH LINE, THE MORE BONUS POINTS YOU GET.  GETTING HIT WITH NO SHIELDS DOES NOT KILL YOU, HOWEVER.  THERE ARE NO LIVES IN THIS GAME.  THE ONLY WAY TO LOSE IS TO FAIL TO CROSS THE FINISH LINE.

ALONG THE WAY YOU'LL ENCOUNTER BOOST PADS THAT TEMPORARILY SPEED YOU UP TO INCREDIBLE SPEEDS AND MAKE YOU INDESTRUCTIBLE.  BY RUNNING OVER ENOUGH GREEN STARS ON EACH COURSE, YOU CAN ALSO EARN SHOCKWAVES, WHICH DESTROY ALL ENEMIES IN YOUR PATH.

NOTE THAT THERE IS NO ACCELERATOR IN THIS GAME.  YOUR CRAFT ALWAYS GOES FULL SPEED, UNLESS YOU HIT SOMETHING.  THEN YOU WILL SLOW DOWN, BUT QUICKLY ACCELERATE BACK TO FULL SPEED.  OTHER THAN THAT, YOU CANNOT SLOW DOWN AND THE ONLY WAY TO SPEED UP IS TO RUN OVER A BOOST PAD.  YOUR ONLY CONTROLS ARE STEERING LEFT AND RIGHT AND AIMING THE GUN ON TOP OF YOUR CRAFT UP AND DOWN.</desc>

		<name>Shadow of the Beast</name>
		<desc>WHILE VERY YOUNG, AARBRON WAS KIDNAPPED AND ENSLAVED BY THE PRIESTS OF THE BEAST LORD. HE GREW UP ON DRUGS MADE TO DESTROY HIS OWN WILL AND TURN HIM INTO THE BEAST MESSENGER, A POWERFUL CREATURE SERVING MALETOTH, THE BEAST LORD HIMSELF. HE DID HIS JOB, UNTIL ONE DAY HE NOTICED A MAN ABOUT TO BE SACRIFICED IN A RITUAL, HIS FACE TRIGGERING ANCIENT MEMORIES... AND AS THE SACRIFICIAL KNIFE DESCENDED INTO THE MAN'S BODY, AARBRON RECOGNIZES THE FACE. OF HIS FATHER.
AS HIS FATHER DIES IN THE ALTAR, MEMORIES OF HIS CHILDHOOD AND TORMENTED PAST AT THE HANDS OF THE BEAST LORD EMERGED, AND AS FEELINGS OF HATE OVER HIS CAPTORS TOOK OVER HIM, HE SWORE REVENGE AND FLED THE TEMPLE, KNOWING THE ROAD TO AVENGE HIS FATHER AND REDEMPTION WOULD BE HARD.

SHADOW OF THE BEAST, ONE OF PSYGNOSIS MOST POPULAR TITLES DURING THE 16-BIT COMPUTER ERA IS A SIDE-SCROLLING PLATFORMER BEST KNOWN FOR THE USE OF PARALLAX SCROLLING ALONG LUSH GRAPHICS, A MUSICAL SCORE  BY DAVID WHITTAKER, A ICONIC COVER BY ROGER DEAN AND WHAT MANY CONSIDER TO BE UNFORGIVING GAMEPLAY, BALANCING BETWEEN THE "VERY CHALLENGING" AND THE "IMPOSSIBLE". THE PLAYER HAS TO NAVIGATE THROUGH SEVERAL AREAS FILLED WITH ENEMIES AND TRAPS, COLLECTING KEYS AND ACTIVATING TRIGGERS THAN OPEN NEW AREAS OR GIVE AARBRON THE MEANS TO OVERCOME A SUB-BOSS. THE NUMBER OF MOVES THE PLAYER HAS AT DISPOSAL IS LIMITED: DUCK, JUMP AND ONLY TWO ATTACKS: PUNCH AND A FLYING KICK. WHILE MOST ENEMIES DIE WITH JUST ONE HIT, THE PLAYER MUST TIME EACH ATTACK ACCURATELY. HOWEVER, THERE ARE ALSO TRAPS OF OBJECTS THAT CANNOT BE DESTROYED, AND THESE REQUIRE THE PLAYER TO JUMP, DUCK OR MOVE ACCORDING THE SEQUENCE. THE PLAYER HAS ONLY ONE LIFE WITH 12 HIT POINTS THAT CAN BE REPLENISHED BY COLLECTING SOME OBJECTS HIDDEN IN THE LEVEL (LIKE AN OFF-ROUTE LOCATION OR A UNDER A MEGALITH), WHICH ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL.</desc>
