		<name>AeroWings 2: Airstrike</name>
		<desc>WHEREAS THE FIRST AEROWINGS GAME WAS ALL ABOUT FLIGHT ACROBATICS, AEROWINGS 2: AIR STRIKE IS A FIGHTER JET GAME. THE MOST IMPORTANT MODES SELECTABLE ARE FREE FLIGHT, WHICH AS THE NAME IMPLIES GIVES YOU FREEDOM TO FLY WHAT YOU WANT (LAND IT IN THE MIDDLE OF A FREEWAY IF YOU'D LIKE OR NEXT TO SKYSCRAPERS) AND OVER WHAT TYPE OF WEATHER AND THE SPLIT-SCREEN VERSUS MODE (2 PLAYER). IN ADDITION TO THOSE MODES, THE GAME FEATURES TRAINING IN  OVER 30 FIGHTER TRAINING MISSIONS AND 15 TACTICAL CHALLENGES. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THESE CHALLENGES WILL UNLOCK ADDITIONAL FIGHTERS (INCLUDING THE XF-3 SUPER RECIPRO, F-2B SUPPORT FIGHTER OR F-15DJ AGGRESSOR 2 TO NAME A FEW) AND DECALS/PAINT FOR THE PLANE MODELS. 

AS FAR AS THE REALISM GOES, THE GAME IS CUSTOMIZABLE WITH OPTIONS FOR EITHER STANDARD OR PROFESSIONAL FLIGHT CONTROLS. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO BEING THE INCLUSION OF MORE REALISTIC G-FORCES ON YOUR PLANE. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE CONTROLS ARE NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE FIRST GAME WITH ONE OR TWO BUTTONS DIFFERENCE.</desc>

		<path>./Dino Crisis (USA)[RDC].cdi</path>
		<name>Dino Crisis</name>
		<desc>THREE YEARS AGO A BRILLIANT SCIENTIST DISAPPEARED WHILE RESEARCHING A NEW FORM OF ENERGY. THE GOVERNMENT THAT FUNDED HIS RESEARCH WROTE THE WHOLE AFFAIR OFF AS A LOSS, WHICH MADE IT ALL THE MORE UPSETTING WHEN REPORTS OF DR. KIRK'S GOOD HEALTH AND NEARLY FINISHED RESEARCH CAME IN. A SPECIAL FORCES TEAM IS SENT TO THE DOCTOR'S PRIVATE ISLAND LABORATORY TO EXTRACT HIM AND HIS RESEARCH, BUT THEY ARE TOTALLY UNPREPARED FOR SOME OF THE SIDE EFFECTS OF HIS DEVELOPMENTS. SIDE EFFECTS THAT COME FROM 100 MILLION YEARS IN THE PAST.

DINO CRISIS IS A SURVIVAL HORROR GAME THAT IS VERY SIMILAR IN BOTH CONTROL AND GAMEPLAY TO ITS SISTER SERIES, RESIDENT EVIL. AS IN THAT SERIES, PROTAGONIST REGINA WILL HAVE LIMITED SUPPLIES AND AMMO WITH WHICH TO FIGHT DEADLY ENEMIES WHILE SEARCHING ROOMS FOR KEYS (SOME FIGURATIVE, SOME LITERAL) TO OPEN LOCKED AREAS. UNLIKE RESIDENT EVIL GAMES, REGINA WILL FIND VERY FEW ACTUAL SUPPLIES LAYING AROUND, AND WILL INSTEAD FIND "PLUGS" THAT ARE USED TO OPEN CACHES OF EMERGENCY SUPPLIES LOCATED AROUND THE COMPLEX. THERE ARE ONLY ENOUGH PLUGS TO OPEN SOME OF THESE CACHES, HOWEVER, SO CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO DECIDE WHAT ITEMS ARE REALLY NEEDED. IN ANOTHER CHANGE FROM RESIDENT EVIL, THE GAME IS RENDERED IN 3D, ALLOWING THE CAMERA TO ROTATE OR PAN, ALTHOUGH CAMERA ANGLES ARE STILL OUT OF THE CONTROL OF THE PLAYER. EVEN THE DUMBEST DINOSAUR IS SMARTER THAN THE UNDEAD, AND ENEMIES CAN CHASE AND DISARM REGINA, AND EVEN OCCASIONALLY FOLLOW HER THROUGH DOORS.</desc>

		<desc>AS MANY AS FOUR (EXPANSION PAK REQUIRED) CAN BAND TOGETHER IN AN EPIC QUEST THROUGH SEVEN MAGICAL WORLDS -- THREE OF WHICH ARE BRAND-NEW TO THE HOME VERSION -- TO DEFEAT THE VILE SKORNE. 

THE NONLINEAR ACTION BEGINS IN A HUB, WHICH LEADS TO THE WORLDS, EACH WITH TWO TO FIVE LEVELS. YOU CAN COMPLETE A LEVEL IN ONE WORLD, THEN MOVE TO ANOTHER WORLD, RETURNING LATER TO FINISH A NEW LEVEL IN THE FIRST WORLD. 

DEVELOPER ATARI GAMES HAS DELIVERED FOUR NEW CHARACTERS IN ADDITION TO THE FOUR IN THE ARCADE VERSION. EACH CHARACTER WILL HAVE UNIQUE SPECIAL ATTACKS. CONTROLLER PAK SUPPORT WILL ALLOW PLAYERS TO TEAM THEIR EVOLVING CHARACTERS. 

ENEMIES, BOSSES, POWER-UPS, MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS ARE ALL GETTING RADICAL MAKEOVERS. ATARI IS BUSILY REMAPPING CARRYOVER LEVELS AND COOKING UP DEVIOUS NEW PUZZLES AND HIDING PLACES FOR ITEMS, SO DON'T EVEN THINK OF CRIBBING FROM THE COIN-OP VERSION. 
 
GRAPHICAL UPDATES INCLUDE REAL-TIME LIGHTING, WHICH IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND IN THE ARCADE VERSION. THE N64 EXPANSION PAK PUSHES PLENTY OF POLYGON-BASED ENEMIES ONTO THE SCREEN. 

THE ESSENTIAL ACTION -- TEAM UP WITH OTHERS, FIND KEYS, MAGIC, RUNES AND OTHER ITEMS, AND BEAT THE STUFFING OUT OF ANYONE IN YOUR WAY -- REMAINS UNCHANGED FROM THE ARCADE HIT. ATARI HAS DELIVERED A FAR MEATIER STORYLINE, THOUGH, SPIFFED UP BY CINEMA CUT-SCENES AT THE SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF A WORLD.</desc>

IT IS A TOP-DOWN, VERTICAL-SCROLLING SHOOT-EM-UP FEATURING FOUR-PLAYER SIMULTANEOUS ACTION, HIGH-RES 3D GRAPHICS, AND AN ORCHESTRAL SCORE. THERE ARE FOUR CHARACTERS TO CHOOSE FROM, EACH WITH HIS OWN STORYLINE AND FIGHTER/SPACESHIP. EACH SHIP HAS ITS OWN WEAPON TYPE AND SPEED.

LIKE THE PREVIOUS GIGA WING AND MARS MATRIX GAMES, GAMEPLAY IS DESIGNED AROUND BULLET ABSORPTION/REFLECTION MECHANICS, LARGE NUMBERS OF ENEMIES, AND GIANT BOSS FIGHTS. GIGA WING 2 ADDS THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE FROM TWO DIFFERENT BULLET REFLECTION POWERS: REFLECT FORCE AND REFLECT LASER. THE REFLECT FORCE REPULSES ENEMY SHOTS, WHILE THE REFLECT LASER USES THEM TO CHARGE UP A BEAM WEAPON.</desc>

		<desc>IN THE WORLD OF GIGA WING, MANY WARS HAVE BEEN FOUGHT FOR THE DIVINE STONE MEDALLION. ENTIRE CIVILIZATIONS WERE DESTROYED IN THE STRUGGLE FOR GAINING CONTROL OF THE LEGENDARY ITEM. NOW, IN THE YEAR 2050, FOUR PILOTS HAVE SET OFF, EACH CARRYING A MYSTERIOUS STONE. THE STONES ARE SAID TO BE THE ONLY WAY TO DESTROY MEDALLION ONCE AND FOR ALL. THE PLAYER CAN CHOOSE TO COMPLETE THE JOURNEY FOR ANY OF THE FOUR PILOTS.

GIGA WING IS A VERTICAL SCROLLING SHOOT 'EM UP. UP TO TWO PLAYERS MUST STEER THEIR PLANES AROUND ENEMY BULLETS AND DESTROY EVERYTHING IN THEIR PATH WITH ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT OF LIVES. WHEN TAPPING THE A BUTTON, THE MAIN GUN IS FIRED. HOLDING THE BUTTON ACTIVATES THE REFLECT FORCE. THE B BUTTON FIRES A BOMB FROM A LIMITED STOCK TO BECOME TEMPORARILY INVINCIBLE. POWER-UPS CAN BE COLLECTED TO INCREASE THE BOMB AND LIFE STOCK OR ENHANCE THE MAIN GUN'S FIRE POWER.

SCORING WORKS BY USING THE REFLECT FORCE TO REPEL ENEMY SHOTS. ONCE THE SHOTS HIT AN ENEMY, MEDALS APPEAR IN THEIR PLACE. WHEN THESE ARE COLLECTED, THE SCORE MULTIPLIER INCREASES.

THERE ARE TWO GAME MODES, ARCADE AND SCORE ATTACK. ARCADE PLAYS JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL COIN-OP GAME, AND SCORE ATTACK LETS THE PLAYER CHOOSE A STAGE AND FIGHT FOR THE HIGHEST SCORE THERE. IN THIS MODE, THE PLAYER HAS UNLIMITED LIVES, HOWEVER THE SCORE MULTIPLIER WILL RESET ONCE THE PLAYER DIES OR USES A BOMB.</desc>

		<desc>WHEN THE HUMANS CREATED ARTIFICIAL BEINGS NAMED "GEARS" IN 22TH CENTURY, THEY DIDN'T EXPECT THAT THEIR CREATION WILL EVENTUALLY TURN AGAINST THEM. BECAUSE GEARS HAD NO WILL OF THEIR OWN AND COULD ONLY OBEY HUMANS. ONLY ONE GEAR, NAMED JUSTICE, WAS ABLE TO TRANSFER HIS WILL ONTO OTHER GEARS AND TO REBEL AGAINST THE HUMANS. IN YEAR 2180, JUSTICE WAS KILLED AS A RESULT OF A BLOODY TOURNAMENT ORGANIZED BY THE SACRED ORDER OF HOLY KNIGHTS. YET RECENTLY, A NEW GEAR WAS DISCOVERED. HE SHOWED NO SIGNS OF HOSTILITY, YET HE HAD NO MASTER AND WAS ROAMING ABOUT FREE. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CAPTURE OR TO KILL HIM BECAUSE HE WAS IMMENSELY STRONG. FEARING A NEW JUSTICE WILL GROW OUT OF THIS GEAR, THE ORDER ORGANIZED YET ANOTHER TOURNAMENT, THIS TIME WITH A SOLID PRIZE: FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WORLD DOLLARS FOR THE WINNER.

"GUILTY GEAR X" IS A FOLLOW UP TO  GUILTY GEAR, AND IS ALSO A 2D FIGHTING GAME. THERE ARE NOW 16 CHARACTERS AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO CHOOSE. THE BATTLE SYSTEM BECAME MORE COMPLICATED, THANKS TO THE VARIETY OF MOVES YOU CAN PERFORM. BESIDE SPECIAL ATTACKS WHICH YOU CAN EXECUTE IF YOU BUILD UP YOUR TENSION GAUGE BY ATTACKING OR ADVANCING TOWARDS YOUR OPPONENT, THERE IS ALSO A VARIETY OF DEFENSING MOVES TO PERFORM. THE INSTANT KILL MOVES ARE BACK FROM THE PREVIOUS GAME.</desc>

		<name>Legacy of Kain - Soul Reaver</name>
		<desc>1500 YEARS AFTER BLOOD OMEN: LEGACY OF KAIN, THE VAMPIRE KAIN'S DECISION AT THE END OF THAT GAME HAS FINALLY DEFEATED THE HUMAN KINGDOMS AND BROUGHT THE WORLD OF NOSGOTH UNDER HIS CONTROL. RULING FROM A CASTLE BUILT ON THE PILLARS OF NOSGOTH, KAIN HAS ESTABLISHED AN EMPIRE OF SIX VAMPIRE CLANS, EACH RULED BY A LIEUTENANT, THE SONS OF KAIN. RAZIEL WAS ONE SUCH LIEUTENANT, BUT LOST HIS POSITION THROUGH THE "INSOLENCE" OF RECEIVING A NEW EVOLUTIONARY "DARK GIFT", THE GROWTH OF FEATHERY WINGS, BEFORE HIS MASTER HAD ACQUIRED IT. FEARING THAT RAZIEL MIGHT ONE DAY SURPASS HIM, KAIN TEARS OFF RAZIEL'S WINGS IN A FIT OF RANGE AND BANISHES HIM INTO THE ABYSS.  THERE, RAZIEL IS LOST IN TIME, DIED AND HIS BODY CONSUMED. THE ELDER GOD RECOVERS RAZIEL'S SOUL AND REBUILDS THE BROKEN BODY, NOT AS A LIVING VAMPIRE, BUT AS A STRANGE NEW CREATURE OF THE UNDERWORLD. SWEARING REVENGE ON KAIN, RAZIEL NOW PHASES SEAMLESSLY BETWEEN NOSGOTH AND IT'S UNDERWORLD, USING HIS NEW POWERS TO BECOME A TERRIBLE REAVER OF SOULS...

SOUL REAVER IS A 3RD PERSON ACTION-ADVENTURE TITLE THAT FOLLOWS RAZIEL ON HIS QUEST TO PURGE THE LAND OF VAMPIRES AND TAKE REVENGE ON KAIN AND HIS BROTHERS, LEADERS OF THE SIX CLANS. THE PLAYER CONTROLS THE GAME FROM BEHIND RAZIEL'S SHOULDER, MOVING HIM IN ANY DIRECTION, CLIMBING, ATTACKING, JUMPING AND USING SPECIFIC ABILITIES. RAZIEL'S CAN GRIP ONTO THE EDGE OF LEDGES AND HIS TORN WINGS ALLOW HIM TO GLIDE GENTLY DOWNWARDS. RAZIEL CAN SHIFT THROUGH THE "MATERIAL" WORLD INTO THE "SPECTRAL" REALM AT WILL... BUT MUST FIND SPECIFIC LOCATIONS IN ORDER TO SHIFT BACK. THE TWO REALMS MIRROR ONE ANOTHER, WITH DISTORTIONS WHICH GIVE ACCESS TO NEW AREAS AND PLATFORMS. EXISTING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD DRAINS RAZIEL'S LIFE ENERGY AT A CONSTANT RATE.  THROUGHOUT THE GAME, ENERGY IS RECOVERED BY CONSUMING THE SOULS OF DEFEATED ENEMIES. IF RAZIEL IS ABLE TO DEFEAT ONE OF HIS BROTHERS, HE WILL ADDITIONALLY GAIN A NEW ABILITY ("DARK GIFT") UPON DRINKING IT'S SOUL. EXAMPLES INCLUDE: THE ABILITY TO SWIM, FILE TELEKINETIC PROJECTILES OR THE ABILITY TO PHASE THROUGH LOCKED GATES. RAZIEL CAN ARM HIMSELF WITH A VARIETY OF WEAPONS INCLUDING SPEARS, DAGGERS, SWORDS, AXES, AS WELL AS ATTACKING ENEMIES BAREHANDED. EVENTUALLY, RAZIEL WILL ALSO COME ACROSS KAIN'S PERSONAL SWORD (NAMED THE SOUL REAVER), AND WILL USE IT TO CREATE A POWERFUL ENERGY BLADE WEAPON.

THE WORLD IS LEFT OPEN TO RAZIEL, HE CAN RETURN TO AREAS PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED AND EXPLORE THE WORLD OF NOSGOTH AT WILL. ACCESS TO CERTAIN AREAS HOWEVER SOMETIMES  REQUIRES THE USE OF GAINED SPECIFIC ABILITIES. MANY OF THE PUZZLES THE PLAYER WILL NEED TO SOLVE IN THIS QUEST ARE "BLOCK PUZZLES", REQUIRING THE PLACEMENT OF CERTAIN LARGE STRUCTURES (USUALLY SQUARE BLOCKS), EITHER TO ACTIVATE SWITCHES OR TO BUILD ACCESS TO OUT-OF-REACH AREAS.</desc>

CAPCOM: CLASH OF SUPER HEROES IS A 2D FIGHTING GAME THAT COMBINES CHARACTERS FROM CAPCOM'S VIDEOGAMES WITH CHARACTERS FROM THE MARVEL COMIC UNIVERSE, SIMILAR TO MARVEL SUPER HEROES VS. STREET FIGHTER. THE GAME TAKES PLACE IN A MARVEL UNIVERSE WHERE PROFESSOR CHARLES XAVIER ASKS THE HEROES TO HELP HIM BEFORE HE MERGES WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MAGNETO TO FORM THE BEING KNOWN AS ONSLAUGHT, THE FINAL BOSS.

THE GAME FOLLOWS THE STANDARD FIGHTING GAMEPLAY, BUT DIFFERENT FROM X-MEN VS. STREET FIGHTER YOU NOW HAVE TO MAKE UP A SQUAD OF THREE CHARACTERS INSTEAD OF TWO. THE OTHER CHARACTERS CAN BE SUMMONED FOR ASSIST ATTACKS AND THERE IS ALSO A DUO TEAM ATTACK TO CONTROL TWO CHARACTERS FOR A BRIEF TIME, ALONG WITH THE ABILITY TO PERFORM SUPER MOVES WHERE THE CHARACTERS TEAM UP.

OPTIONS INCLUDE A STRAIGHT ARCADE BATTLE, 4-PLAYER TAG MODES (DREAMCAST VERSION ONLY), A SURVIVAL MODE (MUCH LIKE STREET FIGHTER ALPHA 3) AND A TRAINING MODE. THE PLAYSTATION VERSION DOES NOT HAVE THE 4-PLAYER TAG MODE AND ALSO REDUCES THE SECOND CHARACTER TO AN ASSIST ROLE, BUT IN ADDITION INTRODUCES A "CROSSOVER" MODE WHERE TAG-TEAM PLAY WITH IDENTICAL TEAMS IS POSSIBLE.

FOR MARVEL THE CAST OF PLAYABLE CHARACTERS INCLUDES SPIDER MAN, CAPTAIN AMERICA, VENOM, HULK, GAMBIT, WAR MACHINE, WOLVERINE, GOLD WAR MACHINE (SECRET CHARACTER), HYPER VENOM (SECRET CHARACTER), ORANGE HULK (SECRET CHARACTER) AND ONSLAUGHT (SECRET CHARACTER). THE CAPCOM SIDE OFFERS CHUN-LI, RYU, ZANGIEF, MORRIGAN AENSLAND, CAPTAIN COMMANDO, MEGAMAN (ROCKMAN IN ASIA), STRIDER HIRYU, JIN SAOTOME, ROLL (SECRET CHARACTER), LILITH-MODE MORRIGAN (SECRET CHARACTER) AND SHADOW LADY (SECRET CHARACTER).

THERE ARE NOW UP TO 56 CHARACTERS TO USE (MOST YOU HAVE TO UNLOCK), INCLUDING NEW CHARACTERS LIKE JILL VALENTINE FROM RESIDENT EVIL AND TRON BONN FROM MEGA MAN LEGENDS.

ANOTHER NEW GAMEPLAY FEATURE ALLOWS YOUR TEAM MATES TO COME IN DURING BATTLE AND GIVE YOU A LITTLE HEALTH BOOST. THIS HELPS IN LASTING THE DISTANCE IN SURVIVAL MODE, BUT THEY CAN ALSO BE HIT BY ON COMING ATTACKS FROM THE ENEMY.</desc>

THE FRIENDLY FAMILY MEETING SOON TURNS INTO A NIGHTMARE: ASSAN KILLS THE YOUNG PRINCE'S BODYGUARDS, LOCKS HIM UP IN A PRISON, AND CAPTURES THE SULTAN. THE REASON IS A LITTLE DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE BROTHERS REGARDING MATRIMONIAL ARRANGEMENTS: IT APPEARS THAT THE SULTAN HAD PROMISED HIS DAUGHTER TO ASSAN'S SON, RUGNOR, AND LATER BROKE HIS PROMISE BY LETTING HER MARRY THE PRINCE. IN THE RESULTING TURMOIL, THE SULTAN IS KILLED, AND THE PRINCESS IS KIDNAPPED BY RUGNOR, A RUTHLESS HALF-TIGER CREATURE. THE PRINCE MUST FIGURE OUT A WAY TO FIND RUGNOR, DEFEAT HIM, AND RESCUE HIS WIFE.

PRINCE OF PERSIA 3D IS JUST WHAT ITS TITLE IMPLIES: AN ACTION PLATFORMER WITH PUZZLE-SOLVING ELEMENTS IN THE STYLE OF THE PREVIOUS PRINCE OF PERSIA GAMES, BUT SET IN A THREE-DIMENSIONAL ENVIRONMENT. THE PRINCE STILL HAS TO TIME HIS JUMPS, AVOID DEADLY TRAPS, INTERACT WITH THE ENVIRONMENT, AND FIGHT RUGNOR'S MINIONS WHO WILL TRY TO STOP HIM.</desc>

		<desc>SO EVIL THEY EVEN GAVE IT A SUBTITLE!

THE FINAL INSTALLMENT OF THE RESIDENT EVIL SERIES FOR THE PLAYSTATION, RESIDENT EVIL 3 TAKES PLACE DURING THE EVENTS OF RESIDENT EVIL 2. THE MIDWESTERN TOWN OF RACCOON CITY IS IN RUINS, HAVING BEEN OVERRUN WITH THE UNDEAD CREATING T-VIRUS THANKS TO THE WACKY HIJINKS OF WILLIAM BIRKIN AND UMBRELLA INC. AS JILL "MASTER OF UNLOCKING" VALENTINE (ONE OF THE TWO MAIN PROTAGONISTS OF THE ORIGINAL RESIDENT EVIL), YOU MUST FIND A WAY OUT OF THE ZOMBIE-INFESTED REMAINS OF THE CITY ALIVE. ALONG THE WAY, YOU'LL INTERACT WITH AND RECEIVE HELP FROM THREE HEAVILY ARMED UMBRELLA MERCENARIES WHO HAVE ALSO BECOME STRANDED IN RACCOON CITY THANKS TO THE INCOMPETENCE OF THEIR EMPLOYER. STANDING IN THE WAY OF YOUR GROUP'S LAST ESCAPE ARE A HORDE OF FLESH-EATING ZOMBIFIED CITIZENS, HOMICIDAL MUTANTS, AND A RELENTLESS KILLING MACHINE KNOWN ONLY AS NEMESIS WHO IS DETERMINED TO HUNT DOWN AND KILL THE SURVIVORS OF THE ORIGINAL RESIDENT EVIL, INCLUDING JILL.

A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT OVER TYRANT/MR. X/G FROM THE PREVIOUS GAMES, NEMESIS POSSESSES THE SAME MANEUVERABILITY AS JILL ALLOWING HIM TO RUN (FASTER THAN YOU, IN FACT), USE FIREARMS (SUCH AS A ROCKET LAUNCHER), DODGE ATTACKS, AND EVEN MOVE THROUGH DOORS AND FROM ROOM TO ROOM IN PURSUIT OF JILL. ON TOP OF THAT HE STILL POSSESSES THE NIGH INDESTRUCTIBILITY WE'VE COME TO KNOW AND... WELL, KNOW FROM UMBRELLA'S ULTIMATE BIO-WEAPONS. 

LIKE ITS TWO PREDECESSORS RESIDENT EVIL 3 IS A THIRD-PERSON ACTION-ADVENTURE GAME WITH POLYGONAL CHARACTERS ON PRE-RENDERED BACKGROUNDS WITH CINEMATIC CAMERA ANGLES, A TECHNIQUE ORIGINALLY PIONEERED BY ALONE IN THE DARK. ALTHOUGH THE GAME USES THE SAME BASIC ENGINE AND GAMEPLAY AS THE PREVIOUS GAMES, IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDE AUTO-TARGETING, A 180 DEGREE SPIN, AND A NEW DODGE MOVE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO AVOID ENEMY ATTACKS BY PRESSING A BUTTON A SECOND BEFORE THEY STRIKE. ANOTHER ADDITION IS JILL'S ABILITY TO CREATE DIFFERENT KINDS OF AMMUNITION BY MIXING TOGETHER THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF GUNPOWDER FOUND THROUGHOUT THE GAME. COMPARED TO RESIDENT EVIL 2, THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE AMMUNITION AND HEALING ITEMS HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED, MAKING THE GAME MORE DIFFICULT. THE VARIETY OF ZOMBIE CITIZENS HAS ALSO BEEN MADE MORE DIVERSE.

THE NUMBER OF POLYGONS IN THE CHARACTER MODELS HAS ALSO BEEN INCREASED, ALONG WITH THE POSSIBLE SCREEN RESOLUTION AND COLOR DEPTH FOR THE PC VERSION (UP TO 1600 X 1200 AT 32 BITS, FROM A MAXIMUM OF 640 X 480 AT 16 BITS FOR RESIDENT EVIL 2). ANOTHER WELCOME ADDITION IN THE PC VERSION IS THE ABILITY TO SKIP CUTSCENES AS WELL AS THE DOOR LOADING ANIMATION.

THE PC AND DREAMCAST VERSIONS INCLUDES ALL EIGHT OF JILL'S POSSIBLE COSTUMES, AS WELL AS THE MERCENARY MINI-GAME OPERATION MAD JACKAL WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO PLAY AS ONE OF THE THREE UMBRELLA SOLDIERS. ON THE PLAYSTATION VERSION, THESE SPECIAL FEATURES MUST BE UNLOCKED BY BEATING THE GAME WITH A HIGH SCORE.</desc>

		<name>Resident Evil Code: Veronica</name>
		<desc>THREE MONTHS AFTER THE EVENTS OF RESIDENT EVIL 2, CLAIRE REDFIELD IS STILL LOOKING FOR HER BROTHER CHRIS. SHE INFILTRATES UMBRELLA CORPORATION'S HEADQUARTERS IN PARIS, WHERE SHE IS CAPTURED AND KNOCKED OUT. WHEN SHE COMES TO, SHE FINDS HERSELF IN A PRISON ON A REMOTE ISLAND. FREED BY A FRIENDLY GUARD, CLAIRE FACES SEVERAL PROBLEMS. NOT ONLY IS THE ISLAND UNDER ATTACK BY AN UNKNOWN ASSAILANT, BUT THERE HAS BEEN ANOTHER OUTBREAK OF THE T-VIRUS AND THE ISLAND IS CRAWLING WITH ZOMBIES AND OTHER MUTATED CREATURES. CLAIRE NOT ONLY HAS TO FACE THE UNDEAD, BUT ALSO THE COMMANDER OF THE BASE, A MAD ARISTOCRAT WITH FAMILY TIES TO THE ORIGINS OF UMBRELLA CORPORATION AND THE T-VIRUS. AND ESCAPING FROM THE ISLAND IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF CLAIRE'S ORDEALS.

CODE: VERONICA CONTINUES THE SURVIVAL HORROR GAMEPLAY OF ITS PREDECESSORS: THE PROTAGONIST EXPLORES THE SURROUNDINGS, FIGHTING MONSTERS AND SOLVING PUZZLES. HOWEVER, CODE: VERONICA IS THE FIRST GAME IN THE SERIES TO DO AWAY WITH PRE-RENDERED BACKGROUNDS, USING A FULLY POLYGONAL 3D ENGINE INSTEAD, WHICH ALLOWS FOR FEATURES SUCH AS REAL-TIME LIGHTING AND CAMERA MOVEMENT. STILL, SUCH MOVEMENTS ARE ONLY USED SPARINGLY, AND THE USE OF PERSPECTIVE IS MOSTLY UNCHANGED FROM EARLIER INSTALLMENTS: THE CAMERA AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHES TO DIFFERENT STATIC ANGLES, SHOWING PROTAGONIST, MONSTERS AND ROOMS FROM DIFFERENT SPOOKY VIEWPOINTS.

MOST OF THE WEAPONS FROM THE EARLIER GAMES MAKE RETURN APPEARANCES: KNIFE, HANDGUNS, SHOTGUN, GRENADE LAUNCHER AND CROSSBOW ARE ALL FEATURED. THERE ARE ALSO NEW WEAPONS INCLUDING A SNIPER RIFLE, AN AK-47 AND SEVERAL GUNS ONLY FOUND IN PAIRS, WHICH CAN BE USED TO TARGET TWO ENEMIES AT THE SAME TIME. SEVERAL WEAPONS UPGRADES CAN ALSO BE FOUND.

SIMILAR TO THE EARLIER GAMES, THE PLAYER WILL NOT ONLY CONTROL CLAIRE, BUT ALSO TWO OTHER CHARACTERS: CLAIRE'S FELLOW PRISONER STEVE, AND HER BROTHER CHRIS.</desc>

		<name>Re-Volt</name>
		<desc>FOR YEARS, THE TOY-VOLT COMPANY HAS BEEN PRODUCING TOYS AND GAMES FOR CHILDREN ALL OVER THE WORLD. WITHIN MONTHS OF INTRODUCING THEIR FIRST PRODUCTS, TOY-VOLT SHOT TO THE TOP! NO ONE COULD PUT THEIR FINGER ON EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS THAT MADE THE TOYS SO POPULAR. SURE, THEY EMPLOYED THE BEST DESIGNERS AND MARKETERS IN THE WORLD, BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT TOY-VOLT TOYS, SOMETHING ALMOST.... MAGIC. NOW, THEIR NEWEST R/C CARS REALLY START TO LIVE! 

RE-VOLT IS A RACING GAME WHERE YOU TAKE CONTROL OVER ONE OF MORE THAN 28 R/C CARS AND DRIVE ON ONE OF THE 13 TRACKS. THE TRACKS ARE VARIED, AND INCLUDE A TOY SHOP, A SUPERMARKET, A LUXURY LINER AND MORE. IT IS POSSIBLE TO PLAY A "REVERSED" (BACKWARDS) OR "MIRROR" (REVERSED LEFT AND RIGHT) VARIETY OF EACH TRACK. THERE ARE ALSO 4 LEVELS OF REALISM TO CHOOSE FROM. 

THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SINGLE- AND MULTIPLAYER GAME MODES TO CHOOSE FROM. THERE'S A SINGLE RACE, WHERE YOU COMPLETE A SINGLE TRACK WHILE COMPETING WITH SEVERAL COMPUTER-CONTROLLED OPPONENTS; A CHAMPIONSHIP, WHERE YOU TRY TO COMPLETE A SERIES OF RACES IN HOPES OF FINISHING ON THE TOP; AND MULTIPLAYER, WHERE YOU PLAY WITH LIVE OPPONENTS. THERE'S ALSO A TIME TRIAL, WHERE YOU'RE ALONE ON THE TRACK, AND SIMPLY TRY TO GET AS BEST A TIME AS POSSIBLE; A PRACTICE MODE, WHERE YOU'RE FREE TO DRIVE AROUND A TRACK TO LEARN ITS STRUCTURE AND SHORTCUTS; AND THE STUNT ARENA, WHERE YOU DRIVE AROUND A SPECIAL ARENA AND TRY TO COLLECT STARS SITUATED IN HARD-TO-REACH PLACES. 

IN SINGLE RACE, CHAMPIONSHIP AND MULTIPLAYER THERE ARE POWER-UPS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE TRACK; PICKING THEM UP GIVES YOU A ONE-USE RANDOM POWER, SUCH AS MISSILES TO LAUNCH AT PESKY OPPONENTS, A STAR TO TEMPORARILY FREEZE COMPETITORS IN PLACE OR A LIGHTNING BOLT, WHICH MAKES YOUR CAR SHOCK OPPONENTS NEARBY TO MAKE THEM STOP.</desc>

		<name>Samba De Amigo</name>
		<desc>SAMBA DE AMIGO IS A HIGHLY UNIQUE GAME:  A MARACAS SIMULATION.  GAME PLAY IS BASED AROUND A SPECIAL MARACAS CONTROLLER THAT YOU USE TO INTERACT WITH THE MUSIC.  THE CONTROLLER SENSES WHICH REGION IN SPACE OUT OF A POSSIBLE 6 THAT THE MARACAS ARE IN.  IT ALSO SENSES WHEN THE PLAYER SHAKES THE MARACAS.  AS THE MUSIC PLAYS, THE PLAYER MUST SHAKE THE MARACAS IN THE APPROPRIATE REGION WITH PROPER TIMING TO PROGRESS.  A STANDARD CONTROLLER CAN ALSO BE USED IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE MARACAS CONTROLLER, WHICH IS SOLD SEPARATELY.

THE MUSIC IN THE GAME COMES FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES.  SOME OF THE SONGS ARE TRADITIONAL SAMBA MUSIC, WHILE OTHERS ARE RECOGNIZABLE POP TUNES, LIKE "MACARENA" AND "TEQUILA."</desc>

MODES INCLUDE TIME TRIALS, STUNT MODE INCLUDING UNIQUE TRACK DESIGNS TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR STUNTS, AND A FOUR PLAYER 'BATTLEMATCH' MODE THAT ADDS WEAPONS TO THE ACTION.</desc>

DESTA VEZ, ELE PLANEJA EXPLORAR O PODER DO CHAOS, UM SER MALÉVOLO QUE SE ALIMENTA DO PODER DAS CHAOS EMERALDS. A SEU MODO, CINCO HERÓIS FARÃO O QUE PUDEREM PARA SALVAR STATION SQUARE E, TALVEZ, O MUNDO INTEIRO.NNNNO JOGADOR PODE SELECIONAR QUALQUER PERSONAGEM APÓS ENCONTRÁ-LOS COM SONIC E CADA UM TEM SUA PRÓPRIA VERSÃO DE CADA FASE. AS FASES DO SONIC ENVOLVEM CORRER ATRAVÉS DA FASE O MAIS RÁPIDO POSSÍVEL, DESTRUINDO QUAISQUER ROBÔS AO LONGO DO CAMINHO. TAILS PODE VOAR E SUAS FASES SÃO SEMELHANTES AO SONIC, EXCETO QUE ELE DEVE VENCER UM OPONENTE CHEGANDO AO FINAL DA FASE ANTES DELE. AMY NÃO PODE CORRER TÃO RÁPIDO QUANTO SONIC E TAILS, MAS ELA TEM UM MARTELO GIGANTE COM O QUAL ELA PODE QUEBRAR OBSTÁCULOS. O OBJETIVO DE SUAS FASES É EVITAR SER CAPTURADA POR UM ROBÔ ENVIADO PELO DR. ROBOTNIK. E102 GAMMA É UM ROBÔ LENTO, DIFÍCIL DE MANOBRAR, MAS TEM ARMAS E MÍSSEIS QUE PODEM ACERTAR VÁRIOS ALVOS AO MESMO TEMPO, ENCADEANDO ATAQUES E GANHANDO UMA PONTUAÇÃO MAIOR E MAIS TEMPO NO RELÓGIO. O OBJETIVO DE SUAS FASES É ALCANÇAR UM CHEFÃO E DESTRUÍ-LO ANTES QUE O TEMPO ACABE. O ÚLTIMO PERSONAGEM É BIG THE CAT, UM PESCADOR QUE PROCURA SEU SAPO PERDIDO. AS FASES DO BIG SÃO QUASE INTEIRAMENTE DESPROVIDAS DE AÇÃO OU LUTA; ELE APENAS PESCA. CADA PERSONAGEM PODE ENCONTRAR ITENS QUE AUMENTAM SUAS HABILIDADES À MEDIDA QUE A HISTÓRIA AVANÇA, COMO UM ANEL PARA SONIC QUE O PERMITE ATRAVESSAR POR UMA FILEIRA DE ANÉIS OU ISCAS MELHORADAS PARA BIG. UM ÚLTIMO CAPÍTULO TERMINANDO A HISTÓRIA É DESBLOQUEADO DEPOIS QUE TODOS OS OUTROS PERSONAGENS FORAM CONCLUÍDOS.NNNNALÉM DISSO, CADA UM DOS PERSONAGENS PODE VISITAR O CHAO GARDEN ONDE ELES PODEM CRIAR CHAOS. ACARICIANDO, ALIMENTANDO E MOSTRANDO ANIMAIS ENCONTRADOS NAS FASES PARA OS CHAOS FAZEM ELES CRESCEREM MAIS FORTES E, OPCIONALMENTE, COLOCÁ-LOS EM CORRIDAS CONTRA OUTROS CHAOS. TAMBÉM CADA FASES NO JOGO TEM OBJETIVOS ADICIONAIS QUE PODEM SER COMPLETADOS PARA ADQUIRIR EMBLEMAS EXTRAS, EMBORA OS EMBLEMAS NÃO FAÇAM NADA NESTA VERSÃO DO JOGO. FINALMENTE, AO MESMO TEMPO, FOI POSSÍVEL ENTRAR ON-LINE E BAIXAR FASES ADICIONAIS E BÔNUS NO JOGO, COMO UM TEMA DE NATAL PARA A STATION SQUARE E UM NÍVEL PATROCINADO PELA AT&amp;T, MAS DESDE QUE O SEGANET FECHOU ISSO NÃO É MAIS POSSÍVEL.</desc>

GAMEPLAY IS BASIC 3D BRAWLING. YOU WILL BE ATTACKED BY ONE OR MORE ENEMIES, AND WILL NEED TO DEFEND YOURSELF, AND ATTACK BACK. THE GAME FEATURES ARCADE AND ADVENTURE MODES. IN THE ARCADE MODE, THE LEVELS ARE TIMED, AND YOU ONLY GET 5 LIVES BUT YOU ARE REVIVED WHERE YOU DIED. IN ADVENTURE MODE, YOU GET UNLIMITED RETRIES OF EACH LEVEL, BUT MUST COMPLETE EACH LEVEL ON A SINGLE LIFE.

NOTE THAT YOUR OBJECTIVE IN EACH LEVEL IS TO KILL EVERY ENEMY; SINCE THE LEVELS HAVE MULTIPLE PATHS, YOU WILL NEED TO BACKTRACK OFTEN.</desc>

INSTEAD OF GUNS, YOUR CHARACTERS HAVE KEYBOARDS STRAPPED TO THEM, AND INSTEAD OF SHOOTING THE ZOMBIES THAT CONSTANTLY JUMP OUT AT YOU YOU'LL NEED TO TYPE OUT THE WORDS ATTACHED TO THE ZOMBIES IN ORDER TO KILL THEM BEFORE THEY CRACK OPEN YOUR HEAD AND FEAST UPON THE GOO INSIDE. THE GAME RANKS YOU ON YOUR TYPING SPEED AND PROVIDES VARIOUS TUTORIALS AND OTHER EDU-TAINMENT SUNDRIES.

OTHERWISE IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME GAME AS HOUSE OF THE DEAD 2. MUCH LIKE THE RESIDENT EVIL SERIES, THE ZOMBIE HORDES HAVE GONE FROM INFESTING A VAGUELY GOTHIC CREEPY OLD MANSION TO INFESTING A VAGUELY GOTHIC DECAYING CITY, AND ITS YOUR JOB TO STOP THEM AND SAVE THE HUMAN RACE (AS USUAL).</desc>

AS IN THE ORIGINAL, PLAYERS SELECT A TEAM OF FIGHTERS FROM VARIOUS CAPCOM AND SNK GAMES THEN FIGHT OTHER TEAMS, WINNING EACH BATTLE BY DEFEATING ALL THE OPPONENTS FROM THE OTHER TEAM.

ASPECTS OF THE FIRST GAME WERE TWEAKED, INCLUDING THE RATIO SYSTEM. IN CONTRAST TO THE FIXED SYSTEM OF THE ORIGINAL, PLAYERS CAN NOW FREELY SELECT CHARACTERS AND ASSIGN EACH OF THEM A NUMBER FROM ONE TO FOUR (OR "RATIO") DETERMINING THEIR RELATIVE STRENGTH, ADDING UP TO A MAXIMUM TEAM RATIO OF FOUR. TEAMS CAN NOW CONSIST OF A MAXIMUM OF THREE CHARACTERS, AS OPPOSED TO FOUR IN THE FIRST GAME. ADDITIONAL CHARACTERS WERE ADDED, INCLUDING MORE CHARACTERS FROM CAPCOM AND SNK TITLES OUTSIDE OF THE STREET FIGHTER AND KING OF FIGHTERS SERIES. THE GROOVE SYSTEM FROM MILLENNIUM FIGHT 2000 HAS BEEN AUGMENTED TO INCLUDE FOUR NEW SYSTEMS OF PLAY BASED ON VARIOUS CAPCOM AND SNK FIGHTING GAMES. IN ADDITION, THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS HAS BEEN INCREASED FROM THE NEO GEO STANDARD OF FOUR TO THE SIX BUTTON SYSTEM FIRST SEEN IN CAPCOM'S STREET FIGHTER.

THE GAME WAS INITIALLY PORTED TO THE SEGA DREAMCAST, FOLLOWED BY A VERSION FOR THE PLAYSTATION 2. THE GAMECUBE AND XBOX RECEIVED AN UPDATED VERSION TITLED CAPCOM VS. SNK 2 EO, WITH THE "EO" REFERRING TO "EASY OPERATION", A GAME OPTION INTENDED FOR NOVICES TO THE GAME. THE PS2 VERSION WAS LATER RELEASED ON PLAYSTATION NETWORK IN JULY 2013.[2]</desc>

		<name>Crazy Taxi</name>
		<desc>CRAZY TAXI IS AN ARCADE-LIKE RACER WHERE THE PLAYER TAKES THE ROLE OF A TAXI DRIVER WHO WEAVES HIS WAY THROUGH CROWDED STREETS, ACROSS SIDEWALKS AND EVEN UNDER WATER, IN A WILD AND FRANTIC RACE TO DELIVER PASSENGERS ON TIME. THE COURSES ARE LARGELY SET INSIDE CITIES CROWDED WITH GENERAL TRAFFIC AND PEDESTRIANS (WHICH CAN'T BE RUN OVER, THEY DIVE AWAY). THE MAIN GOAL IS TO BRING AS MANY CUSTOMERS AS POSSIBLE TO THEIR DESTINATION IN TIME. AVAILABLE CUSTOMERS ARE MARKED THROUGH CIRCLES AND THE COLOUR REPRESENTS THE DISTANCE AND THE FARE THEY OFFER. GREEN MEANS LONG RIDES WITH PLENTY OF MONEY, AND RED ONES ARE VERY SHORT. 

IN THE MAIN ARCADE MODE THERE IS A TIMER THAT QUICKLY RUNS DOWN. IT CAN BE REPLENISHED BY PICKING UP CUSTOMERS. WHILE DRIVING RECKLESS MANEUVERS ARE ENCOURAGED. PLAYERS CAN DISREGARD ALL TRAFFIC RULES AND CUSTOMERS GIVE EXTRA TIPS FOR SPEEDY AND DANGEROUS DRIVING, BUT THESE CAN ONLY BE CASHED WHEN THE CUSTOMER ARRIVES AT HIS DESTINATION IN TIME. BY THE SAME TOKEN THE REWARD AT THE END OF A RIDE IS BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF TIME LEFT, AS EACH CUSTOMER ALSO HAS A PERSONAL TIMER. THE CITY IS FILLED WITH SLOPES AND JUMPS, AND THE GAME USES A VERY LOOSE DRIVING MODEL. NO DAMAGE CAN BE DONE TO THE CAR, SO DRIVING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE IS ENCOURAGED. WHILE DRIVING PLAYERS CAN TOY WITH THE GEARS TO PERFORM TWO SPECIAL TRICKS: A CRAZY DRIFT AND A CRAZY BOOST TO SPEED UP MORE QUICKLY.

NEXT TO THE ARCADE MODE THERE IS AN ORIGINAL MODE, AND CRAZY BOX WHERE SPECIFIC GOALS NEED TO BE MET ON CLOSED DOWN COURSES. IN THE REGULAR MODES IT IS POSSIBLE TO DISREGARD THE USUAL TIMER AND PLAY FOR A FIXED AMOUNT OF MINUTES. AT THE END OF THE RACE THE PLAYER IS REWARDED WITH A LICENSE, EITHER D, C, B OR A, WITH S FOR AN OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE. NEXT TO THE INTERACTIVE COURSES FROM THE ARCADE VERSION THERE IS A NEW COURSE FOR HOME CONSOLES. THERE ARE FOUR CABS AND DRIVERS TO CHOOSE FROM. THE CARS HAVE DIFFERENT STATISTICS AND THE DRIVERS DIFFERENT ATTITUDES WHILE RACING. THE GAME HAS A SOUNDTRACK FEATURING THE OFFSPRING AND BAD RELIGION (NOT FOR THE XBOX 360 VERSION).</desc>
