		<desc>AIR BUSTER IS A FAST SIDE-SCROLLING SHOOTER. THE PLAYER CONTROLS A SMALL CRAFT THROUGH DIFFERENT LEVELS WITH MANY ENEMIES. EVERY LEVEL ENDS WITH A BOSS AND SOME SECTIONS SPEED UP THE GAMEPLAY, OFFERING FAST OBSTACLE COURSES BOTH HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY SCROLLING. FLYING ORANGE PODS RELEASE MANY POWER-UPS AT ONCE, ENHANCING THE SHIPS WITH NEW OR MORE POWERFUL LASERS, WING MEN AND SHIELDS. THE PLAYER CAN ALSO HOLD THE FIRE KEY TO CHARGE A BLAST THAT REMOVES ALL ENEMY BULLETS FROM THE SCREEN AND DEALS DAMAGE TO ALL ENEMIES. WITH AN UNFORGIVING DIFFICULTY, EVERY HIT IS FATAL, BUT THE GAME CAN BE CONTINUED FROM ANY POINT AS LONG AS THERE ARE LIVES AND CREDITS LEFT. THE GAME CAN BE PLAYED WITH TWO PLAYERS COOPERATIVELY.</desc>

		<desc>IN 1992, HUDSON SOFT EXPANDED UPON THE BONK'S ADVENTURE FRANCHISE THEY HAD BUILT BY CREATING AIR ZONK, A 2D SIDE-SCROLLING "CUTE 'EM UP" SHOOTER SET IN A CYBERPUNK-ESQUE FUTURE. WHILE AIR ZONK DIFFERED FROM ITS SUCCESSOR IN TERMS OF GAMEPLAY, THE CARTOONISH STYLE OF THE BONK SERIES COULD STILL BE SEEN ALL THROUGHOUT THE GAME, ESPECIALLY IN THE GRAPHICS, THE CHARACTERS, &amp; OF COURSE, ZONK HIMSELF.

AIR ZONK MAY APPEAR TO FEATURE A CANDY CARTOON COATING ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT IT'S STILL A TRADITIONAL SHOOT-'EM-UP AT HEART. YOU STILL HAVE A SELECTION OF YOUR BASIC WEAPON POWER-UPS (8 IN TOTAL HERE), BUT SPREAD GUNS &amp; POWERFUL BURSTS ARE NOW REPRESENTED BY KILLER DECKS OF CARDS &amp; GIANT METAL MANDIBLES. LARGE, IMPOSING ENDBOSSES ARE STILL THE NORM, BUT HERE YOUR FOES RANGE FROM GIANT HEAPS OF LIVING GARBAGE TO KILLER FOOTBALL PLAYERS. AND OUTER SPACE? WHO NEEDS TO BLOW UP THINGS THERE WHEN YOU HAVE OTHER VENUES (5 IN TOTAL) SUCH AS A GIGANTIC STADIUM TO DO IT IN?

IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THIS, AIR ZONK GIVES YOU A FEATURE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CHOOSE FROM ONE OF 10 "FRIENDS" AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH LEVEL WHO WILL FIGHT BY YOUR SIDE ONCE YOU PICK UP A CERTAIN POWER-UP. THESE FRIENDS RANGE FROM GIANT SCUD MISSILES TO LIVING DUMP TRUCKS TO FLOATING COW-THINGS, AMONG OTHERS. PICK UP ANOTHER POWER-UP, &amp; ZONK &amp; HIS FRIEND COMBINE TO CREATE A POWERFUL HYBRID FORM, FEATURING SOME OF THE STRANGEST ATTACKS YOU MAY EVER SEE IN A VIDEO GAME.

SO WILL ZONK BE ABLE TO DEFEAT KING DROOL, RESCUE THE MOON FROM HIS CLUTCHES, &amp; SAVE THE WORLD? AS USUAL, THE ANSWER IS UP TO YOU...</desc>

		<desc>BLACK BOMBERMAN HAS CUT POWER TO THE GALAXY'S OWN POWER STATION, WHICH RESULTED IN DISPUTES BETWEEN SEVEN PLANETS, AND IT IS UP TO WHITE BOMBERMAN TO RESTORE POWER TO THE STATION AND BRING PEACE TO THE PLANETS AGAIN. THE OBJECTIVE IS THE SAME AS IN DYNA BLASTER: USE BOMBS TO DESTROY ALL ENEMIES IN A LEVEL. ONCE YOU HAVE DESTROYED THEM ALL, FIND THE EXIT HIDDEN IN A BLOCK SO YOU CAN BE TRANSPORTED TO THE NEXT LEVEL. A BLOCK WILL ALSO FLASH YELLOW TO LET YOU KNOW THAT A POWER-UP CAN BE OBTAINED THERE. POWER-UPS INCLUDE MORE BOMBS, MANUAL DETONATION, EXTRA LIVES, AND EXTENDED FLAMES. OCCASIONALLY, YOU ALSO GET THE ABILITY TO WALK THROUGH BOMBS OR WALLS, OR TO KICK BOMBS.

IF YOU MANAGE TO REVEAL THE EXIT BEFORE ALL ENEMIES ARE DESTROYED, IT REMAINS IN AN "INACTIVE" STATE, MEANING THAT YOU CANNOT BE TRANSPORTED TO THE NEXT LEVEL UNTIL YOU BLOW UP ALL THE ENEMIES AND THEREFORE MAKING IT "ACTIVE". IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY BLOW UP THE EXIT, WHETHER IT IS ACTIVE OR NOT, OR IF TIME RUNS OUT, YOU WILL UNLEASH A FEW ENEMIES THAT YOU ALSO NEED TO DESTROY. AFTER EVERY EIGHTH LEVEL, THERE IS A BOSS THAT YOU NEED TO DESTROY TO PROCEED TO THE NEXT PLANET.

BESIDES THIS NORMAL MODE, THERE ARE TWO OTHER MODES: BATTLE AND VERSUS. IN BATTLE, YOU CAN PLAY AGAINST FOUR HUMAN- OR COMPUTER-CONTROLLED PLAYERS IN ONE OF SEVEN STAGES, EACH WITH DIFFERENT FEATURES LIKE WARP HOLES, CONVEYOR BELTS, REVOLVING DOORS, AND MUCH MORE. IN VERSUS, YOU PLAY HEAD-TO-HEAD AGAINST A FRIEND USING THE TURBOEXPRESS FOR NON-STOP ACTION. REGARDLESS OF THESE TWO MODES, YOU CAN STILL OBTAIN POWER-UPS TO GIVE OUT SOME PUNISHMENT AGAINST YOUR FELLOW PLAYERS, AND THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF WINS CAN BE SET BEFORE PLAY.</desc>

THE RANGE OF EXPLOSION CAN BE UPGRADED WITH TIME, BUT IF YOU DIE, THE RANGE RESETS TO MINIMUM AND YOU LOOSE YOUR PREVIOUS SKILLS, THOUGH. SOME UPDATES CAN MAKE YOU WALK THROUGH THE WALLS, INCREASE YOUR SPEED, AND GIVE YOU SOME OTHER ASSETS TO AID YOU IN YOUR QUEST TO SAVE THE WOMAN YOU LOVE.

THE GAME IS NOT UNLIKE OTHER PLATFORM GAMES OF THE ERA. THOUGH IT'S UNIQUE IN THAT YOU CAN CLIMB WALLS AND SWING ON ROPE WITH YOUR TEETH AND YOUR ONLY METHOD OF ATTACK IS HEAD BUTTING ENEMIES - STRAIGHT FORWARD OR DIVE BOMB STYLE. THE GAME STARTS OFF WITH SIMPLISTIC POINT A TO POINT B STYLE, BUT FOCUSES MORE ON EXPLORATION IN THE LATER STAGES, WHICH INCLUDE FINDING HIDDEN BONUS AREAS. 

THE GAME IS ALSO KNOWN FOR ITS TRADEMARK GAMEPLAY MECHANISM OF 'SPIN ATTACK', WHERE BONK FLOATS THROUGH THE AIR IF YOU HAVE THE TURBO BUTTON ON. THIS CAN BE USED TO FLOAT AROUND THE LEVEL AND REACH AREAS FOR EXTRA/HIDDEN ITEMS, BUT ALSO AS A METHOD OF ATTACK AS WELL. THE GAME STARTS YOU OFF WITH 3 HEARTS, BUT ALLOWS YOU TO INCREASE THIS NUMBER WHEN YOU FIND SPECIAL HEART CONTAINER ITEMS, ALLOWING BONK TO TAKE A NUMBER OF HITS BEFORE DYING.

A VARIETY OF BONUS STAGES CAN BE FOUND THROUGHOUT THE GAME, WHICH PROVIDE BONUS POINTS UPON COMPLETION AND THUS RESULTING IN ACCUMULATING EXTRA LIVES. ENEMIES THEMSELVES CAN BE 'MILKED' FOR POINTS IN THAT YOU CAN KEEP 'BONKING' THEIR DEAD BODIES AND NOT LETTING THEM HIT THE GROUND. SPIN ATTACK IS ANOTHER METHOD FOR DOING THIS.</desc>

		<name>Double Dungeons</name>
		<desc>DOUBLE DUNGEONS IS A SOLO DUNGEON CRAWLER IN THE STRICTEST SENSE. ONE OR TWO PLAYERS CAN EXPLORE PSEUDO-3D, MAZE-LIKE DUNGEONS (WITHOUT AUTO-MAP FEATURE, BUT WITH DIRECTIONS DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN) AND FIGHT THE MONSTERS POPULATING THEM. THE PLAYER(S) CAN CHOOSE TO VENTURE INTO ANY OF THE AVAILABLE 20 DUNGEONS. THE DUNGEONS HAVE THE SAME TEXTURES, BUT THEIR LAYOUT VARIES; THE HIGHER IS THE NUMBER OF THE CHOSEN DUNGEON, THE MORE DANGEROUS ARE ITS ENEMIES. TWO-PLAYER MODE FEATURES A SPLIT SCREEN; THE TWO PLAYERS START EXPLORING THE DUNGEON FROM DIFFERENT POINTS.

THE BASIC GAMEPLAY IS VERY SIMPLE. ENEMIES APPEAR AT SPECIFIC POINTS (THEY CAN ALSO RE-SPAWN), AND MUST BE DEFEATED IN ORDER TO PROCEED. THE COMBAT IS TURN-BASED AT ITS CORE, THOUGH THE TURNS FOLLOW VERY QUICKLY, AND THE ENEMIES WILL ATTACK EVEN IF THE PLAYER DOES NOTHING. ATTACKING IS DONE SIMPLY BY PRESSING A BUTTON; THERE ARE NO OTHER COMBAT OPTIONS. 

THE PLAYER CAN FIND EQUIPMENT AND HEALING ITEMS (WHICH CAN ALSO BE DROPPED BY ENEMIES). THESE CAN BE USED TO RESTORE THE PLAYER CHARACTER'S HP OUTSIDE OF BATTLES. LEVELING UP IS COMPLETELY AUTOMATIC.

THERE IS NO NARRATIVE IN THE GAME; THE ONLY STORY-RELATED INFORMATION COMES IN FORM OF VERY SHORT TEXT INTROS TO THE DIFFERENT DUNGEONS, ALONG THE LINES OF "THE KING WANTS TO RETRIEVE A TREASURE AND SENDS A WARRIOR INTO THE DUNGEON" OR COMPARABLE MISSION OBJECTIVES.</desc>

PERIODICALLY THE PLAYER ENCOUNTERS CHALLENGING STAGES, WHICH ARE SET TO MUSIC AND FEATURE "DANCING" ENEMIES.  THE OBJECTIVE IS TO SHOOT ALL 40 ENEMIES BEFORE THEY DISAPPEAR, FOR A BONUS OF AT LEAST 10,000 POINTS. THERE ARE A TOTAL OF 29 STAGES. THE PLAYER CAN BEGIN WITH ONE SHIP WITH TWO IN RESERVE OR START RIGHT OUT WITH A DUAL SHIP (BUT ONLY ONE IN RESERVE).  

SOME ENEMIES NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMBINE INTO A MUCH LARGER SINGLE ENEMY THAT TAKES MULTIPLE SHOTS TO DESTROY. OTHERS EXPLODE IN A BRILLIANT SHOWER OF FIREWORKS WHEN DESTROYED, AND OCCASIONALLY THESE ENEMIES DROP A SMALL FORMATION OF MUCH SMALLER ENEMIES THAT "WIGGLE" THEIR WAY DOWN THE SCREEN.  SOME ENEMIES ARRIVE IN SPHERICAL "EGGS" AND EMIT A LOUD, HIGH-PITCHED NOISE WHEN HIT. THESE CREATURES TAKE MULTIPLE HITS TO DESTROY IN FLIGHT (JUST ONE HIT IN FORMATION), AND THEIR MAIN ATTACK PATTERN IS TO MOVE ABOUT HALFWAY DOWN THE SCREEN, STOP, FIRE MULTIPLE SHOTS AT ONCE, AND THEN FLY STRAIGHT DOWN OFF THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.  ANOTHER TYPE OF ENEMY TAKES AT LEAST FIVE HITS TO DESTROY, AND IT GROWS LARGER WITH EACH CONSECUTIVE HIT, MAKING IT BOTH A LARGER TARGET AND ALLOWING IT TO ACT AS A SHIELD TO OTHER ENEMIES. 

LATER IN THE GAME SOME ENEMIES ARE EQUIPPED WITH ARMOR THAT RENDERS THEM INVINCIBLE WHILE IN FORMATION. WHEN ONE OF THESE ENEMIES STARTS ITS DIVE, IT WILL FLIP OVER AND EXPOSE ITS VULNERABLE SIDE, THEN FLIP OVER AGAIN AND BECOME INVINCIBLE WHILE IT MOVES BACK UP THE SCREEN, THEN FLIP ONE MORE TIME AND FINISH ITS DIVE. WHILE VULNERABLE, THIS ENEMY CAN BE DESTROYED IN ONE HIT, SCORING BONUS POINTS. IN ADDITION, MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF OBSTACLES APPEAR THROUGHOUT THE GAME, INCLUDING BLUE CRYSTALS, BOULDERS AND GREEN BLOBS.</desc>

		<desc>MONTY MOLE HAS BEEN LIVING IN LUXURY SINCE HIS PREVIOUS ADVENTURES, BUT HE HAS NOW BEEN BEAMED UP BY AN ALIEN RACE WHO WANT HIM TO DO A JOB FOR THEM. MONTY MUST TREK THROUGH FIVE WORLDS TO RETRIEVE THE SACRED SCROLLS OF THE RACE'S GUARDIANS. 

AS WITH CORE'S PREVIOUS HIT RICK DANGEROUS 2 THERE IS VERSATILITY IN THE EXACT STRUCTURE OF THE GAME. THE FIRST FOUR CONSIST OF THE ORIENT, A KLONDIKE MINE, AN ICE WORLD AND AN AMAZON FOREST - ONCE THESE ARE COMPLETED THE FINAL WORLD IS OPEN TO YOU.

THE PLATFORM-BASED GAMEPLAY IS SIMILAR TO MONTY'S EARLIER GAMES, WITH PRIMARILY HORIZONTAL PROGRESSES AS WELL AS ROPES AND LADDERS TO NAVIGATE. MONTY HAS DEVELOPED A USEFUL FLYING KICK, AND HAS BEEN GIVEN A SMART BOMB, WITH THE POTENTIAL TO COLLECT EXTRA BOMBS AND GUNS. HAZARDS, ENEMIES AND LEVEL DESIGNS ARE THEMED AROUND EACH LEVEL, AND RANGE FROM CABLE CARS AND FALLING SNOWBALLS TO NINJAS AND MONKEYS.</desc>

YOUR PARTNER DOESN'T LIKE THIS ONE BIT, SO HE DECIDES TO MAKE A NUISANCE OF HIMSELF ALONG THE WAY. SIMILAR TO ADVENTURE ISLAND, YOU MUST MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH SEVERAL LEVELS, DESTROYING WILDLIFE ALONG THE WAY, BUT INSTEAD OF USING A HAMMER, YOU HAVE THREE DIFFERENT WAYS TO KILL THEM: JUMP ON OR KICK THEM, OR WHEN THEY ARE WALKING ON THE GROUND, BLOW GAS OUT OF THEM. 

WHILE SCROLLING THROUGH THE LEVEL, YOUR VITALITY WILL DECREASE, BUT IT CAN BE RESTORED BY COLLECTING FRUIT AND JUNK FOOD. DURING YOUR TRAVELS, YOU WILL ALSO ENCOUNTER YOUR PARTNER DOING THINGS THAT SHOULDN'T BE DONE IN PUBLIC, BUT SOMETIMES, HE WILL THROW STUFF AT YOU TO MAKE YOU LOSE SOME OF YOUR VITALITY. THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN DEAL WITH HIM IS BY KICKING HIM WHERE IT HURTS.

ALONG THE WAY, YOU CAN ENTER DOORS. DOING THIS WILL GIVE YOU A HINT ABOUT THE LEVEL AND YOUR VITALITY WILL BE INCREASED AS WELL. YOU CAN KICK CERTAIN OBJECTS SUCH AS LAMP POSTS, TRASHCANS, OR THIN AIR TO OBTAIN COINS, OR TO MAKE HIDDEN PLATFORMS APPEAR. COINS CAN BE USED IN SLOT MACHINES THAT WILL GIVE YOU EXTRA VITALITY, MORE LIVES, EXTRA COINS, AND MORE. SLOT MACHINES ONLY APPEAR WHEN YOU ENTER CERTAIN DOORS.</desc>

YOU ARE JAZETA'S SON, AND YOU MUST FIRST OF ALL FIND YOUR MISSING FATHER! CAN IT BE THAT THE SHADOW OF EMPEROR OF DARKNESS THREATENS THE PEACEFUL LAND AGAIN?..

THE SEQUEL TO "NEUTOPIA" IS SIMILAR TO THE PREDECESSOR IN EVERY WAY. NAVIGATING YOUR HERO FROM A TOP-DOWN VIEW, YOU EXPLORE THE VAST COUNTRYSIDE, FIGHTING MONSTERS IN REAL TIME COMBAT. THE GAME IS NOT A TRUE RPG, BUT AN ACTION ADVENTURE: YOU DON'T GAIN ANY EXPERIENCE POINTS FROM COMBAT, ONLY COLLECT MONEY TO BUY SUPPLIES. IN DUNGEONS, YOU MUST USE BOMBS ON WALLS TO REVEAL SECRET PASSAGES, PUSH STONES, AND FIGHT MANY REGULAR ENEMIES AND BOSSES.</desc>

TO REACH HIS CASTLE AND RESCUE TINA, MASTER HIGGINS MUST FIRST RESCUE THE SIX CHILDREN, EACH OF WHOM IS HIDDEN ON A SEPARATE ISLAND.

NEW ADVENTURE ISLAND IS A ONE-PLAYER ACTION GAME THAT CONSISTS OF SEVEN AREAS, WITH FOUR ROUNDS EACH. IN ORDER TO GET THROUGH THE AREAS, YOU MUST USE YOUR HATCHET TO DESTROY WILDLIFE SUCH AS FROGS, SPIDERS, BIRDS, SNAILS, INSECTS, AND OTHER PESTS, AND WATCH OUT FOR HAZARDS SUCH AS ROCKS, FIRE, WATER, AND PITS. 

AS YOU PROGRESS FURTHER, YOUR VITALITY WILL GET LOW, SO FRUIT MUST BE COLLECTED IN ORDER TO RESTORE IT. ALONG THE WAY, YOU CAN SMASH OPEN EGGS THAT WILL AWARD YOU WITH BETTER WEAPONS THAT INCLUDE BOOMERANGS, ARROWS, AND MAGICAL FIRE. SOME OF THE EGGS WILL ALSO REVEAL A FAIRY, WHICH WILL PROTECT YOU FROM GETTING HIT. IF YOU ARE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND AN EGGPLANT HIDDEN IN ONE OF THESE EGGS, YOUR VITALITY WILL DRAIN AWAY VERY FAST, AND YOU NEED TO GET FRUIT EVERY FIVE SECONDS IN ORDER TO SURVIVE.

WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF AN AREA, YOU WILL HAVE TO DEFEAT ONE OF THE HENCHMEN AND RESCUE A CHILD FROM ONE OF THE FOUR CASTLES.

		<desc>IN THE YEAR 2090, EARTH IS INVADED BY EXTRA-TERRESTRIALS. THE WORLD ALLIANCE OF NATIONS HAS DEVELOPED A SUPERSONIC ATTACK FIGHTER, RAIDEN, TO DEFEND THE EARTH. A PILOT MUST TAKE CONTROL OF THE EXPERIMENTAL FIGHTER TO DESTROY THE ALIEN WARSHIPS THAT JUST HAPPEN TO LOOK LIKE ODD VARIATIONS OF TYPICAL MILITARY TANKS AND PLANES WITH GADGETS ATTACHED TO THEM. 

RAIDEN (CALLED RAIDEN TRAD ON THE GENESIS AND SNES) IS AN OVER-HEAD VERTICAL-SCROLLING SHOOTER, BASED ON AN ARCADE GAME OF THE SAME TITLE. IT FEATURES TWO FORMS OF WEAPON UPGRADES AND TWO TYPES OF MISSILES (NORMAL OR HOMING). YOU START THE GAME WITH SEVERAL BOMBS WHICH YOU CAN USE TO DESTROY MOST ENEMIES ON THE SCREEN TO GET YOURSELF OUT OF A JAM. EACH LEVEL ENDS WITH A LARGE BOSS OR BOSSES.</desc>

		<name>R-Type</name>
		<desc>R-TYPE IS A SIDE SCROLLING SHOOT 'EM UP BEST KNOWN FOR ITS EXTREMELY TOUGH AND STRATEGIC GAMEPLAY.  YOU CONTROL THE R-9 SPACESHIP AS IT LAUNCHES A LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO REPEL THE EVIL BYDO EMPIRE.

THE R-9 COMES EQUIPPED AS STANDARD WITH A SMALL GUN WHICH CAN ONLY TAKE DOWN THE SMALLEST OF ENEMIES WITHOUT FIRING SEVERAL SHOTS. BY HOLDING DOWN THE FIRE BUTTON, IT CAN BE LOADED UP SO AS TO RELEASE A LARGE BURST OF ENERGY, ELIMINATING ALL BUT THE STRONGEST ENEMIES IN ITS PATH. FROM TIME TO TIME, PODS WILL COME FLYING IN YOUR DIRECTION. UPON BEING SHOT, THEY RELEASE AN UPGRADE. THE FIRST ONE WILL INVARIABLY BE THE ONE CALLED "THE FORCE", WHICH IS A WEAPONS POD THAT CLINGS EITHER TO THE FRONT OR THE BACK OF YOUR SHIP, ABSORBING ANY ENEMY BULLETS OR ACTING AS A BUMPER WITH WHICH YOU CAN FLY HEAD-ON INTO THEM. YOU CAN ALSO USE IT AS AN OFFENSIVE WEAPON BY FIRING IT AND PULLING IT BACK IN. MASTERING THE FORCE IS VITAL TO SURVIVING IN R-TYPE, SINCE IT MUST BE USED BOTH AS PROTECTION AGAINST BULLET CLUSTERS, AS A REMOTE CONTROLLED CANNON, AND IN ORDER TO CLEAR THE SCREEN FROM OBSTACLES. OTHER UPGRADES GIVE YOU TARGET-SEEKING MISSILES OR A BIGGER MAIN GUN. DIFFERENT GUN TYPES, DIFFERENTIATED BY THEIR COLOUR, SERVE DIFFERENT PURPOSES. THE BLUE ONE SENDS LASER BEAMS BOUNCING ACROSS THE SCREEN (GOOD FOR TUNNELS), THE RED ONE FIRES STRAIGHT AHEAD, AND THE YELLOW ONE FOLLOWS ANY WALLS IT MAY ENCOUNTER (GOOD FOR ARTILLERY EMPLACEMENTS).

THE STAGES OF R-TYPE ARE MADE IN AN ORGANIC STYLE, CERTAINLY INSPIRED BY H. R. GIGER'S ARTWORK FOR THE ALIEN MOVIES. WHEN IT CAME OUT, IT WAS CONSIDERED TREND-SETTING SINCE IT BROKE OFF FROM THE STEREOTYPICAL SCI-FI MOULD OF OTHER SHOOT'EM'UPS. IN PART, THE LEVELS THEMSELVES ARE YOUR ENEMY, WHICH IS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE FOURTH, WHERE SPIDER-LIKE CREATURES WEAVE WEBS THAT COVER THE SCREEN AND BLOCK YOUR PATH, OR LEVELS WITH INTRICATE TUNNEL SYSTEMS. STILL, THE LEVELS ARE BEST HANDLED WITH A COMBINATION OF STRATEGY AND REFLEXES, WITHOUT THE MEMORISATION THAT IS REQUIRED OF R-TYPE'S CONTEMPORARY RIVAL, GRADIUS.</desc>

		<name>Super Volleyball</name>
		<desc>SUPER VOLLEYBALL IS AN INDOOR VOLLEYBALL GAME FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS. THE SINGLE PLAYER MODE OFFERS TWO GAME OPTIONS: NORMAL GAME AND WORLD LEAGUE. CHOOSING NORMAL GAME PITS THE PLAYER AGAINST THE COMPUTER IN A SINGLE GAME. CHOOSING WORLD LEAGUE PITS THE PLAYER AGAINST ALL OTHER TEAMS AVAILABLE. A PASSWORD SAVE IS AVAILABLE IN THIS MODE.

THE GAME FEATURES EIGHT NATIONAL TEAMS (USA, USSR, BRAZIL, HOLLAND, FRANCE, ITALY, JAPAN AND CHINA), WITH FICTITIOUSLY NAMED PLAYERS. PLAYERS CAN BE CHANGED DURING GAMEPLAY BY PRESSING C. THERE IS ALSO AN OPTION TO CREATE NEW TEAMS, CHOOSING THE TEAM'S NAME, COLOR, PLAYER'S POSITION AND NAMES.

GAMEPLAY IS VIEWED FROM A SIDE SCROLLING PERSPECTIVE, WITH THE CAMERA FIXED ON THE BALL. A SMALL RADAR ON THE TOP OF THE SCREEN SHOWS THE PLAYERS' POSITIONS OF BOTH TEAMS. PLAYERS CAN, BUMP, SET, SPIKE, DUMP, BLOCK AND DIG. A COLLECTION OF SERVES IS ALSO AVAILABLE: UNDERHAND, OVERHAND AND JUMP SERVE. THERE ARE ALSO OPTIONS FOR THREE BALL SPEEDS, BEGINNING POINTS (FROM 0 TO 10, OUT OF 15) AND HANDICAP.</desc>

		<name>Takin' It to the Hoop</name>
		<desc>TAKIN' IT TO THE HOOP IS A BASKETBALL GAME WITH COMIC GRAPHICS. THE PLAYER EITHER PARTICIPATES IN A LEAGUE, PLAY-OFFS OR A SINGLE MATCH AND CHOOSES ONE OF EIGHT AMERICAN TEAMS WITH TWELVE ATHLETES. THE TEAM'S PERFORMANCE DURING A MATCH DOES NOT ONLY DEPEND ON THE PLAYER'S ABILITY BUT ALSO ON THE ATHLETHE'S STATISTICS (E.G. AGILITY OR DRIBBLING) AND THEIR ENERGY. ENERGY DECREASES DURING THE COURSE OF A MATCH AND DESCRIBES HOW MUCH POWER AN ATHLETE HAS LEFT. THERE ARE ALSO THREE DIFFERENT DEFENSE TACTICS (ONE-ON-ONE DEFENSE, ZONE DEFENSE OR A MIX BETWEEN THE TWO) WHICH CAN BE SET BEFORE THE MATCH OR DURING INTERCEPTIONS.

DURING THE MATCHES, THE PLAYER CONTROLS THE BALL CARRIER WHEN IN OFFENSE AND MANUALLY SWITCHES BETWEEN ATHLETES WHEN IN DEFENSE. PASSES CAN BE PERFORMED IN A HIGH OR LOW VARIATION. WHILE MOST OF THE MATCH IS SHOWN IN A SLIGHTLY HEIGHTENED SIDE-SCROLLING PERSPECTIVE, THE GAME SWITCHES TO A CLOSE-UP VIEW DURING A PENALTY THROW OR A DUNKING TRY. HERE THE PLAYER NEEDS TO PRESS A BUTTON AT THE CORRECT TIMING FOR A SUCCESSFUL THROW. WHEN A DEFENSE ATHLETE IS NEARBY DURING A DURING MANEUVER, HE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BLOCK THE BALL WHEN THE CORRECT TIMING IS MET.</desc>

THE GAME USES VARYING CAMERA POSITIONS, WITH TOP-DOWN VIEWS WHEN THE BALL IS CLOSE TO EITHER HOOP, AND A SIDE-VIEW WHEN THE BALL IS MID-COURT - CONTROLS REMAIN UNCHANGED FOR THESE, SO THE SWITCH DOESN'T CAUSE A SUDDEN CHANGE IN PLAYER MOVEMENT.

AS WELL AS PLAYING THE MATCHES YOU HAVE FULL COACHING CONTROL. THIS CAN INVOLVE MAKING SUBSTITUTIONS BUT ALSO ASSIGNING MARKING AND GAME STRATEGIES.</desc>

THE GAME OFFERS EXHIBITION MATCHES AND A TOURNAMENT MODE, EIGHT INTERNATIONAL TEAMS (EACH WITH UNIQUE PLAYER STATISTICS), AND SUPPORT FOR UP TWO FIVE PLAYERS VIA THE TURBOTAP.

AFTER A DRAMATIC CLOSE-UP OF THE FACE-OFF, ACTUAL GAME PLAY IS SEEN FROM A TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE WITH A VERTICALLY SCROLLING FIELD. EVERY PLAYER (INCLUDING THE GOALIE) CAN BE CONTROLLED. ON OFFENSE, QUICK SHOTS, SLAP SHOTS AND EVEN FAKED SLAP SHOTS ARE POSSIBLE. ON DEFENSE, BODY CHECKING AN OPPOSING PLAYER CAN LEAD TO A SPECIAL FIGHT SEQUENCE.

EXHIBITION GAMES CAN BE PLAYED WITH EITHER FULL OR EASY RULES - EASY MODE HAS LESS PENALTIES AND INFRACTIONS LIKE OFFSIDE. IN TOURNAMENTS, EVERY SCHEDULED GAME CAN EITHER BE PLAYED OR THE RESULTS SIMULATED. TOURNAMENT PROGRESS IS SAVED VIA A PASSWORD. WHEN TWO OR MORE PLAYERS PLAY, THEY CAN BE PUT ON ANY TEAM. THUS TEAMS FEATURING FIVE HUMAN PLAYERS ARE JUST AS POSSIBLE AS MIXED COMPETITIVE MATCHES.</desc>
