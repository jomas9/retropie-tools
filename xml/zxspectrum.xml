		<name>3D Combat Zone</name>
		<desc>3D COMBAT ZONE IS A 1ST-PERSON TANK HUNTING GAME WHICH TAKES PLACE ON A VAST PLAIN SCATTERED WITH PYRAMIDS. IT TRANSPORTS THE PLAYER INTO THE VALLEYS OF LACENTRA, NOW A BATTLEFIELD OCCUPIED WITH THE SPOILS OF A CENTENARY WAR BATTLED BETWEEN TWO OPPOSITE FACTIONS.

THE SOLITARY VEHICLE IS EQUIPPED WITH A RADAR SYSTEM AND PROVIDED WITH A MIGHTY CANNON LOADED WITH HEAVY PIERCING SHELLS.

IN DESPERATION, FEDERATION COMMAND SENDS THE NEW STARSTRIKE SPACE FIGHTERS TO ATTACK THE OUTSIDERS'S MAIN BASES (WHICH ARE CONVERTED MOONS), HOPING TO EXPLOIT A FATAL FLAW IN THE DESIGN: A DIRECT HIT TO THE REACTOR AT THE CENTER OF THE BASE MIGHT LEAD TO ITS DESTRUCTION.

BOTH REGARDING GRAPHICS AND GAMEPLAY, 3D STARSTRIKE IS ESSENTIALLY A CLONE OF ATARI'S STAR WARS. USING WIREFRAME GRAPHICS WITH A FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE, THE PLAYER CONTROLS THE STARSTRIKE FIGHTER IN SEVERAL DISTINCT PHASES: THE FIRST PHASE IS THE APPROACH TO THE ENEMY BASE, WHERE OUTSIDER SPACE FIGHTERS MUST BE DESTROYED. THE SECOND PHASE TAKES PLACE CLOSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE BASE, WHERE ENEMY BUNKERS AND LASER TOWERS AWAIT. THE THIRD PHASE IS A TRENCH RUN, WHERE GUN TURRETS AWAIT AT THE SIDE OF THE TRENCH, AND CATWALKS BLOCKING THE WAY MUST BE DOGDED. THE RUN CULMINATES IN THE REACTOR ROOM, WHERE TWO REACTOR PODS MUST BE HIT TO DESTROY THE BASE.

AFTER A BASE IS DESTROYED, THE GAME CONTINUES WITH A NEW BASE IN THE NEXT LEVEL, WITH LATER LEVELS HAVING A HIGHER DIFFICULTY.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>THE ORIGINAL BREAKOUT CONCEPT INVOLVES CONTROLLING A BAT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND USING IT TO CATCH AND DIRECT A BALL SO AS TO HIT ALL THE BRICKS WHICH ARE ARRANGED AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. IT WAS UNPOPULAR FOR OVER A DECADE, BEFORE TAITO REVIVED IT WITH SOME NEW IDEAS IN THIS ARCADE GAME.

THE GAME'S PLOT REDEFINES THE BAT AS A VAUS SPACESHIP, THE BALL AS AN ENERGY BOLT, AND THE BRICKS FORM A MYSTERIOUS WALL STOPPING THE SHIP FROM PROGRESSING TO SAFETY.

BY THE MID-80S, POWER-UPS WERE POPULAR IN MOST TYPES OF ARCADE GAMES, AND ARKANOID FEATURES THEM. THEY ARE CAUGHT BY POSITIONING THE BAT BELOW THEM AS THEY FALL (MEANING THAT YOU RISK MISSING THE BALL IF YOU GO FOR THEM AT THE WRONG TIME). THE POWER-UPS INCLUDE LASERS (WHICH ARE MOUNTED TO EACH SIDE OF THE SHIP AND ALLOW YOU TO SHOOT OUT THE BLOCKS), A CATCHING DEVICE (SO AS TO BE ABLE TO FIRE THE BALL OFF AT A DIFFERENT ANGLE EVERY TIME YOU HIT IT) AND ONE THAT SLOWS THE BALL.... SORRY, BOLT.... DOWN. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE GAME INSPIRED TONNES OF CLONES, FEW OF WHICH ADDED ANYTHING ELSE.</desc>

THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF TRAVELLING THROUGH THE LEVELS - SOME BOUNCY PLATFORMS COUPLED WITH A NEW SUPER-LEAP MOVE ALLOW FOR BIG PROGRESS TO BE MADE, WHILE MONTY CAN ALSO SUSPEND FROM THE CEILINGS AND DODGE HIS WAY ACROSS. MONTY CAN NOW FALL WITHOUT BEING HURT, ALTHOUGH LANDING ON WATER CAN CAUSE MULTIPLE LIVES TO BE LOST IN QUICK SUCCESSION.

THE PROJECTION CAN ONLY ACT OR MOVE THROUGH THE USE OF SPELLS.THE TWO BASIC SPELLS ARE MOVEMENT AND SERVANT SPELLS.

ONLY UP TO FOUR OBJECTS CAN BE CARRIED AROUND AT A TIME AND THERE ARE AROUND 220 LOCATIONS ON EIGHT LEVELS. ENEMIES WILL ATTACK THE PROJECTION AND DRAIN IT'S ENERGY WHICH CAN BE REPLENISHED WITH A SPELL, IF DEPLETED THE PROJECTION IS DESTROYED AND THE GAME REVERTS TO MAROC OUTSIDE THE CASTLE, READY FOR ANOTHER GO.</desc>

		<name>Ball Breaker</name>
		<desc>BALL BREAKER IS BREAKOUT VARIANT. THE PLAYER CONTROLS A PADDLE WHICH IS FIXED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND IS ONLY ABLE TO MOVE VERTICALLY. WITH THIS PADDLE, A BALL IS BOTH BOUNCED INTO THE PLAYFIELD AND PREVENTED FROM FALLING OUT OF THE SCREEN. THE GOAL IS TO VAPORIZE ALL BLOCKS ON THE PLAYFIELD BY HITTING THEM WITH THE BALL. A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MISSILES CAN BE USED TO DESTROY BLOCKS OR ALIENS DIRECTLY. THE LATTER APPEAR ON HIGHER LEVELS AND SHOULD NOT BE TOUCHED WITH THE PADDLE.

THE SPECIALITY OF THIS VARIANT IS THE USE OF AN ISOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE. WHILE THE BALL AND PADDLE ITSELF DO NOT LEAVE THE LOWER PLANE, THE BLOCKS ARE STACKED UP. THE HIGHER BLOCKS FALL DOWN WHEN THE BLOCKS BELOW THEM ARE GONE.</desc>

		<name>Batty</name>
		<desc>BATTY IS INFLUENCED BY ARKANOID'S METHOD OF REVIVING THE BREAKOUT PHENOMENON. YOU CONTROL A PADDLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, WITH THE TOP HALF OF THE SCREEN CONTAINING AN ARRANGEMENT OF BRICKS, MOST OF WHICH CAN BE DESTROYED. YOU MUST MOVE THE PADDLE LEFT AND RIGHT SO AS TO MAKE CONTACT WITH A BALL, AND THUS DEFLECT IT (USING THE WALLS AT THE SIDES STRATEGICALLY) INTO THE BRICKS, SOME OF WHICH REQUIRE MULTIPLE HITS TO DESTROY. WIPE THE DESTRUCTIBLE BRICKS OUT, AND YOU MOVE ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL; FAIL TO KEEP THE BALL IN PLAY AND YOU LOSE ONE OF YOUR 5 LIVES.

SOME DESTROYED BRICKS RELEASE POWER-UP TOKENS, WHICH MUST BE 'CAUGHT' WITH THE BAT AS THEY FALL. FUNCTIONS INCLUDE MULTI-BALL, A LARGER PADDLE, AND THE ABILITY TO 'CATCH' AND RELAUNCH THE BALL EACH TIME, WHICH MAKES IT A LOT EASIER TO GAIN ACCESS TO PRECISE BRICKS OR AREAS.

BATTY ALSO HAS ENEMIES FLYING AROUND AND DROPPING BOMBS TOWARDS YOU - THE BOMBS CAUSE YOUR BAT TO STICK FOR A SECOND, PERHAPS COSTING A LIFE. MANY LEVELS CONTAIN MAGNETS AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN, WHICH MAKE THE BALL'S PATH HARDER TO PREDICT. THE TWO PLAYER MODE GIVES EACH PLAYER ACCESS TO HALF THE PLAYFIELD, SO CO-OPERATION IS REQUIRED.</desc>

ONE DAY HIS EVIL COUSIN COMES ALONG AND LURES HIM AND HIS FOUR BROTHERS DIRECTLY INTO SAID METAPLANES AND LEAVES THEM FOR GOOD. SO BOBBY'S QUEST OF THE DAY IS TO FIND HIS WAY HOME AND RESCUE HIS BROTHERS.

THE METAPLANES ARE A BIG MAZE OF ISOMETRIC SCREENS WITHOUT SCROLLING. THE MAIN CHALLENGE IS TO FIND ORIENTATION IN THIS MAZE WITH VARIOUS DEAD ENDS AND JUNCTIONS; THERE ARE ALSO LIFTS, MAGNETS, AIR DUCTS AND HIDDEN SWITCHES TO COMPLICATE MATTERS. THERE ARE ALSO ENEMIES AND TRAPS TO AVOID, E.G. EVIL MARBLES, CRUSHING BLOCKS OF STONE OR HARD TO NAVIGATE PLACES WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO FALL OFF THE SCREEN.

WHEN BOBBY FINDS ONE OF HIS BROTHERS, BOBBY HAS TO ROLL HIM TO THE EXIT. THERE ARE NO LIVES OR ENERGY BARS TO BE FOUND IN THIS GAME: IT SIMPLY HAS TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT. DYING OR GETTING STUNNED BY AN ENEMY RESULTS IN A TIME PENALTY. SIMILARLY THE PLAYER CAN EASILY RESTART A SCREEN WITH A TIME PENALTY IF HE HAS MANOEUVRED HIMSELF INTO AN UNWINNABLE SITUATION.</desc>

THE GAME STARTS OFF WITH THE MANAGEMENT SIDE OF THINGS INCLUDING TRAINING THE TEAM, BUYING EQUIPMENT, AND KEEPING THOSE FINANCES FROM THE RED. IF YOU GO BANKRUPT THEN IT'S GAME OVER. GOING BANKRUPT CAN HAPPEN FROM SPENDING TOO MUCH MONEY, CRASHING, OR POOR FINISHES.

WHEN YOU START THE RACE OR SEASON THEN IT'S TIME TO START RACING. THE GAME IS VIEWED FROM INSIDE THE BOB BEHIND THE DRIVER AND BRAKEMAN. YOU STEER THE BOB LEFT AND RIGHT (GRAVITY CONTROLS THE SPEED) AS YOU WATCH THE TRACK HURTLING TOWARDS YOU. YOU CAN SEE YOUR SPEED AND TIMES AS WELL.

DO WELL AND YOU RECEIVE MORE MONEY. THIS CAN GO TOWARDS MORE TRAINING AND BETTER EQUIPMENT.

GOOD LUCK FOR THE SEASON AND HOPEFULLY YOU CAN GET TO THE OLYMPICS. YOUR GONNA NEED ALL THE LUCK IN THE WORLD.</desc>

		<desc>BUBBLE BOBBLE IS THE STORY OF TWO HUMANS, BUB AND BOB WHO WANDER INTO THE MYSTERIOUS CAVE OF MONSTERS AND MAGICALLY TURN INTO DINOSAURS. THE ONLY WAY TO TRANSFORM BACK IS TO REACH THE END OF THE CAVE...

BUBBLE BOBBLE IS A PLATFORM GAME, WITH EACH LEVEL BEING A SINGLE SCREEN. THE ENEMIES MUST BE CLEARED FROM A LEVEL TO GO TO THE NEXT ONE. WITH ONE PLAYER CONTROLLING BUB AND THE OTHER CONTROLLING BOB, THE PLAYER CAN JUMP AND COLLECT ITEMS FOR POINTS (SUCH AS FRUIT). THE REAL POWER BUB AND BOB HAVE HOWEVER IS THE ABILITY TO BLOW BUBBLES. THESE BUBBLES CAN BE AS PLATFORMS TO LEAP ON, OR TO TRAP ENEMIES. ENEMIES TRAPPED IN A BUBBLE MUST BE POPPED BY JUMPING INTO THEM, WHEREIN THEY'LL TURN TO FRUIT. ADDITIONALLY, POWER-UPS SOMETIMES FLOAT BY IN BUBBLES. THEY INCLUDE LIGHTNING, WHICH FLIES OUT HORIZONTALLY AT ENEMIES, AND WATER, WHICH DRAGS THE PLAYER AND ENEMIES STRAIGHT DOWN FLOWING OVER PLATFORMS. TAKING TOO LONG TO COMPLETE ANY LEVEL WILL SUMMON BARON VON BLUBBA, WHO WILL FLOAT AROUND THE SCREEN TRYING TO DESTROY THE PLAYER.</desc>

		<name>Carrier Command</name>
		<desc>CARRIER COMMAND WAS ONE OF THE FIRST REAL-TIME STRATEGY GAMES.

YOU CONTROL AN ADVANCED CYBERNETIC AIRCRAFT CARRIER COMPLETE WITH FIGHTERS, AMPHIBIOUS ASSAULT VEHICLES, LASER DEFENSES AND A FLEET OF DECOY DRONES.  YOUR MISSION IS TO BUILD A SERIES OF RESOURCE, FACTORY, AND DEFENSIVE BASES SPANNING AN ISLAND CHAIN.  THE ONLY PROBLEM?  AT THE OTHER END OF THE CHAIN IS AN EVEN MORE ADVANCED CARRIER UNDER CONTROL OF A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION WITH THE SAME MISSION.

AS YOU MOVE AROUND THE ISLANDS YOU MUST DECIDE WHAT FACILITIES TO BUILD AND WHERE THEY WILL BEST SUPPORT YOUR ADVANCE.  RESOURCE ISLANDS PROVIDE MATERIALS THAT FACTORY ISLANDS CAN USE TO BUILD WEAPONS AND VEHICLES TO REPLACE YOUR COMBAT LOSSES BUT BOTH WILL BE QUICKLY OVERRUN IF THE ENEMY ATTACKS THEM WHILE YOU ARE NOT PRESENT.  YOU ALSO HAVE TO ENSURE THAT YOUR STOCKPILES OF EQUIPMENT ARE STORED SAFELY UNTIL YOU CAN FIND TIME TO LAUNCH A RESUPPLY DRONE TO BRING THEM TO YOUR CARRIER.

FROM YOUR CARRIER, YOU CAN TAKE FIRST PERSON CONTROL OF YOUR ATTACK AIRCRAFT AND AMPHIBIOUS TANKS AND USE THEM TO ASSAULT ENEMY ISLANDS OR EVEN THE ENEMY CARRIER ITSELF IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND IT.  THE WEAPON PAYLOADS ON YOUR VEHICLES ARE COMPLETELY CONFIGURABLE BASED ON YOUR NEEDS.  AN ISLAND INVASION MAY REQUIRE LAUNCHING A VIRUS BOMB THAT WILL TAKE OVER THE ENEMY COMMAND SYSTEMS OR JUST BLASTING THE BASE WITH A WIRE GUIDED SURFACE TO SURFACE MISSILE.

ULTIMATELY, YOU HAVE TO FIND AND DESTROY THE ENEMY CARRIER BUT, DOING SO WILL REQUIRE A SOLID SUPPLY INFRASTRUCTURE AND A STRATEGY FOR DEPRIVING YOUR OPPONENT OF HIS.</desc>

CERIUS IS A FLICK-SCREEN SHOOT EM UP, CHARACTERISED BY YOUR AVENGER UNIT BEING UNABLE TO JUMP, NEEDING INSTEAD TO RELY ON THE ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPORTERS IN ORDER TO NAVIGATE ROGORFS BASE.

COMPLETING THE LEVELS REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE BACK-TRACKING, A FACT MADE MORE AWKWARD FOR THE PLAYER BY THE FACT THAT THE SCREENS RESET WHEN YOU LEAVE THEM.

EACH OF THE THREE LEVELS CONTAINS FOUR GUARDIAN ENEMIES, ALL OF WHICH MUST BE DESTROYED. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY EACH RELEASE A LETTER, WHICH MUST BE REARRANGED TO FORM THE CORRECT FOUR-LETTER PASSWORD FOR THE FINAL DOOR.</desc>

IN IT YOU ARE A WIZARD WHO BATTLES IT OUT AGAINST UP TO SEVEN OTHER WIZARDS THAT CAN BE BOTH PLAYER AND/OR COMPUTER CONTROLLED. THE LAST ONE ALIVE WINS. THE GAME IS TURN BASED AND EACH TURN IS DIVIDED IN TWO PARTS. IN THE FIRST YOU SELECT AND CAST SPELLS AND MOVEMENT IS DONE IN THE SECOND.

THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT SPELLS AVAILABLE. SOME OF THEM LET YOU SUMMON CREATURES TO ATTACK THE OPPONENT WHILE OTHERS WILL IMPROVE YOUR ABILITIES OR ARE OFFENSIVE (LIKE LIGHTNING) OR DEFENSIVE (SUMMON CASTLES). SUMMONING SPELLS WOULD INCLUDE CENTAURS AND HORSES, WHICH CAN BE MOUNTED BY THE WIZARD AND ENABLE YOU TO MOVE ACROSS THE PLAYING BOARD QUICKLY. SPELLS CAN ALSO BE EITHER LAWFUL, NEUTRAL OR CHAOTIC, SO THE CHANCES OF SUCCESS INCREASE IF THE WIZARD HAS THE SAME ALIGNMENT.</desc>

		<desc>THREE GIRLS HAVE BEEN REPORTED MISSING INCLUDING THE MAYOR'S DAUGHTER, AND CHASE SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS HAS ASKED YOU TO TRACK DOWN FIVE VEHICLES, MENTIONED IN THE MISSION BRIEFING, WHO ARE BELIEVED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE KIDNAPPING. USING A HEAVY-DESIGNED MACHINE WITH A V6 DOHC 3000CC TWIN TURBO ENGINE, FIVE SETS OF NITRO-FUEL BOOSTS, AND A GUN ATTACHED TO THE STEERING WHEEL (WHICH YOU CAN USE TO DAMAGE THE TARGET VEHICLE), YOUR MISSION IS TO PATROL THE STREETS AND FIND THESE VEHICLES.

THE GAMEPLAY IS SIMILAR TO CHASE H.Q., BUT THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENCES. FOR EXAMPLE, CARS TRAVEL IN BOTH DIRECTIONS INSTEAD OF ONE, AND SOME OF THEM WILL CATCH UP TO YOUR CAR AND SHOOT AT YOU. AT LEAST ONCE IN EVERY STAGE A HELICOPTER DOES A FLY BY AND DROPS YOU SOME GRENADES YOU CAN USE TO FURTHER DAMAGE THE TARGET VEHICLE. A GUY ON A MOTORCYCLE WILL CATCH UP TO YOU AND THROW GRENADES AT YOUR CAR. AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, AS MENTIONED EARLIER, YOU CAN SHOOT AT THE TARGET VEHICLE RATHER THAN JUST BUMPING INTO IT.

HAVE FUN DRIVING AROUND, BUT REMEMBER, THERE IS A STRICT TIME LIMIT, SO I WOULDN'T WASTE TIME OR KEEP CRASHING INTO THINGS IF I WERE YOU.</desc>

THE DUCKLINGS ALSO EAT THE CORN, HOWEVER.

THERE ARE ONLY 8 DISTINCT LEVELS.  THE NINTH LEVEL IS A COPY OF LEVEL 1, THE TENTH IS A COPY OF LEVEL 2, AND SO ON.  HOWEVER, ON THE SECOND TIME AROUND THE DUCKLINGS THAT CAN USE THE PLATFORMS AND LADDERS ARE REPLACED BY THE MOTHER DUCK, WHO CAN FLY AROUND THE LEVEL GOING THROUGH THE PLATFORMS AND LADDERS.

IN THE TERRANYA WAR IT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED THAT THE PLANET VESTA IS FULL OF THE MOST PRECIOUS SUBSTANCE IN THE GALAXY, KARILLIUM, WHICH WITH ONE DROP CAN TURN A DESERT INTO A JUNGLE. THE PLANET ORBITS AROUND THE STAR CALEST DEEP IN A MYON ZONE, BUT THE EARTH MANAGED TO INVADE AND CAPTURE THE PLANET WITH UNMANNED SHIPS. WITH THE PLANET FULL OF KARILLIUM MINES POWERED BY AN ENERGY GRID WHICH IN TURN IS POWERED BY CALEST, THE MYONS HAVE DECIDED TO DESTROY THE ENERGY GRID WHICH WILL SHUT DOWN THE MINES AND THE MINERS WILL LEAVE THE PLANET. UNDER THE RULES OF WAR, ONLY ONE MANNED SHIP CAN DEFEND A INHABITED PLANET AND MAT HAS BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE CHOSEN.

THE GAME IS VIEWED FROM A 1ST PERSON PERSPECTIVE AS YOU LOOK OUT FROM YOUR COCKPIT INTO DEEP SPACE, WITH YOUR GUN IN FRONT OF YOU. USING A QUADRANT CHART, YOU CAN SEE ROWS OF SATELLITES THAT POWER THE MINES WHICH ALSO SHOWS YOUR LOCATIONS AS WELL ANY MYON SHIPS. YOU ARE ABLE TO CONTROL YOUR SPEED AS WELL AS DIRECTION AND IF YOU NEED TO MOVE LARGER DISTANCES THEN YOU CAN WARP AS LONG AS YOU INPUT YOUR DIRECTION. AS YOU PROGRESS THROUGH THE GAME YOU WILL FIND THE MYONS DAMAGING THE SATELLITES AND THESE NEED REPAIRING BY TWO DROIDS ON YOUR SHIP WHO CAN ALSO REPAIR YOUR SHIP.

YOUR SHIP ALSO CONTAINS VARIOUS SCANNERS AS WELL AS A MANUAL OR AUTOMATIC TARGETING SYSTEM. ONCE YOU COME ACROSS A WAVE OF MYON SHIPS YOU MUST DESTROY THEM WITH EITHER YOUR LASER OR PLASMA WHILE USING THE SCANNERS FOR THEY POSITION. ONCE A WAVE IS DESTROYED THEN YOU CAN REPAIR ANY DAMAGED SATELLITES OR YOUR SHIP IF NEEDED. TO HELP PROTECT YOURSELF FROM ATTACK YOUR SHIP HAS SHIELDS WITH DECREASE WHEN HITS ARE TAKEN. YOU CANNOT BE DESTROYED THOUGH BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE CLOSE TO DESTRUCTION YOU TELEPORT AWAY FROM THE PLANET. THE GAME IS OVER IF THE POWER TO THE PLANET IS STOPPED BY A DAMAGED ROW OF SATELLITES.</desc>

		<name>Combat School</name>
		<desc>THE CONTROL PANEL CONSISTS OF A TRACKBALL AND TWO BUTTONS WITH DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS DEPENDING ON THE EVENT. THE GAME CAN BE PLAYED AGAINST A CPU-CONTROLLED OPPONENT OR A SECOND PLAYER. PLAYER 1 TAKES CONTROL OF NICK, A BROWN-HAIRED RECRUIT IN AN ORANGE SHIRT, WHILE PLAYER 2 IS JOE, A BLOND-HAIRED RECRUIT IN A BLUE SHIRT. THE GAME SYSTEM IS SIMILAR TO KONAMI'S TRACK &amp; FIELD SERIES.

THE GAME IS COMPOSED OF SEVEN TRAINING EVENTS WHOM THE PLAYER MUST COMPLETE. UPON A NEAR-SUCCESS FAILURE TO COMPLETE AN EVENT (FAILING TOO SEVERELY RESULTS IN GAME OVER), THE PLAYER MUST DO A SET NUMBER OF CHIN UPS AS PUNISHMENT (THIS CHANCE IS GIVEN ONLY ONCE) IN ORDER TO CONTINUE INTO THE SUCCEEDING EVENTS, OR IT'S GAME OVER. THE EVENTS ARE AS FOLLOWED:

    OBSTACLE COURSE ? SET IN A SIDE-SCROLLING SEGMENT, THE PLAYER MUST REACH THE END OF THE STAGE UNDER THE ALLOTTED TIME BEFORE HIS OPPONENT WHILE CLIMBING WALLS AND CLEARING BARS. LOSING TO THE CPU OR TO ONE ANOTHER DOES NOT MEAN GAME OVER AS LONG AS THE PLAYERS CROSS THE FINISH LINE WITHIN THE ALLOTTED TIME.
    SHOOTING RANGE NO. 1 ? THE PLAYER MUST SHOOT AS MANY TARGETS AS POSSIBLE UNDER THE ALLOTTED TIME. IF PLAYED AGAINST A SECOND PLAYER, THEN THE ONE WHO SHOOTS THE MOST TARGETS WIN.
    IRON MAN RACE ? SIMILAR TO THE OBSTACLE COURSE, BUT SET IN A TOP VIEW ANGLE. THE PLAYER MUST REACH THE GOAL WHILE AVOIDING MINES AND OTHER OBSTACLES. EVENTUALLY THE PLAYER MUST CROSS A LAKE BY EITHER SWIMMING OR ROWING A BOAT. LOSING TO THE CPU OR TO ONE ANOTHER DOES NOT MEAN GAME OVER AS LONG AS THE PLAYERS CROSS THE FINISH LINE WITHIN THE ALLOTTED TIME.
    SHOOTING RANGE NO. 2 ? SAME AS THE FIRST ONE, BUT NOW WITH MOVING TARGETS.
    ARM WRESTLING ? THE TWO RECRUITS ARE PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER IN A MATCH OF STRENGTH AND STAMINA. THIS IS MORE LIKE A BONUS STAGE THAN AN ACTUAL COURSE: THE PLAYER IS NOT PENALIZED FOR LOSING.
    SHOOTING RANGE NO. 3 ? THE THIRD AND FINAL SHOOTING RANGE STAGE FEATURES PENALTY TARGETS.
    FIGHTING ? THE PLAYER FACES AGAINST HIS INSTRUCTOR IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT IN THE FINAL EVENT. THERE IS NO MAKE-UP PUNISHMENT IN THIS EVENT. IF A PLAYER LOSES THIS EVENT, IT IS GAME OVER NO MATTER WHAT. IF PLAYED WITH A SECOND PLAYER, THEN THE TWO PLAYERS MUST FIGHT EACH OTHER. ONLY THE VICTOR IS ALLOWED TO GRADUATE.

AFTER ALL SEVEN EVENTS ARE CLEARED, THE PLAYER GRADUATES FROM BASIC TRAINING ONLY TO BE SENT ON A MISSION (THE 8TH AND THE FINAL STAGE) TO RESCUE THE U.S. PRESIDENT FROM ARMED TERRORISTS. THE FINAL STAGE CONSIST OF A SINGLE SIDE-SCROLLING LEVEL WHERE THE PLAYER MUST FIGHT OFF TERRORISTS USING ALL THE SKILLS ACQUIRED DURING THE COURSE OF TRAINING. THIS STAGE CAN ONLY BE PLAYED BY ONE PLAYER. WITHOUT A CONTINUE FEATURE, WITHOUT SPARE STOCKS OF LIVES, AND THE PLAYER DIES WITH ONE HIT (MINUS THE PART THAT PITS YOU IN A HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT AGAINST THE TERRORIST LEADER) FROM ANYTHING, THE FINAL STAGE IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CLEAR.</desc>

		<desc>IT'S WHODUNIT TIME IN THIS LICENSED ARCADE ADVENTURE STARRING SAM CRUISE. AS SAM YOU MUST COLLECT THE CLUES BY WALKING OVER THEM, WITH THE HOPE OF FINDING THE KILLER. MONEY IS AN ISSUE AS WELL, AS MORE CAN BE COLLECTED, BUT IT WILL BE NEEDED AS THE GAME GOES ON.

THE CITY IS AWASH WITH GANGSTERS, AND NEITHER THEY NOR THE POLICE ARE HAPPY WITH YOUR METHODS OR MOTIVES. GANGSTER BULLETS SHOULD BE AVOIDED IF POSSIBLE, AS YOU ONLY HAVE THE MEDICAL KITS TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE FROM 8 SHOTS - FORTUNATELY A PLETHORA OF EVASIVE MOVES ARE OFFERED INCLUDING ROLLS AND SOMERSAULTS. THE POLICE CAN BE EVADED BY WEARING DISGUISES.

MANY BUILDINGS CAN BE ENTERED AND EXPLORED FOR CLUES, BUT LEAVING THE LIGHTS ON CAN ALERT PEOPLE TO YOUR PRESENCE. TELEPHONE CALLS PLAY A BIG PART IN THE GAME - INITIALLY YOU ONLY HAVE THE NUMBER FOR YOUR OFFICE, BUT THIS IS A POTENTIAL GOLDMINE OF CLUES, AND MORE NUMBERS CAN BE OBTAINED IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO HACKER.</desc>

		<desc>THE HOME CONVERSIONS OF CONTINENTAL CIRCUS LACK THE FULL-ON 3D AND SPECIAL GLASSES OF THE ARCADE VERSION, BUT RETAIN THE ESSENTIAL GAMEPLAY STRUCTURE. THE FIRST RACE IS IN BRAZIL AND FEATURES 100 CARS, AND REQUIRES YOU TO FINISH IN THE TOP 80 IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR  NEXT RACE. AS YOU WORK THROUGH THE 8 RACES THE SIZE OF THE FIELD STEADILY DECREASES, BUT SO DOES THE WORST ACCEPTABLE FINISHING POSITION TO QUALIFY.

THE CAR HAS HIGH AND LOW GEARS, AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE FROM CONTACT WITH ANOTHER CAR. ONCE YOU HIT A CAR OR A PIECE OF THE TRACKSIDE SCENERY YOU WILL BE CALLED INTO THE PITS - FAIL TO MAKE IT BACK, OR HIT ANOTHER CAR, AND YOU WILL CRASH AND LOSE SEVERAL SECONDS.</desc>

		<desc>NINE HOLES OF CHAOTIC TOP-VIEWED RICOCHETS AND HAZARDS MAKE UP THIS EARLY CRAZY GOLF GAME. THEY CAN BE SKIPPED FOR A SCORE OF 12 IF YOU GET STUCK. THERE ARE NO MOVING HAZARDS, SO GAMEPLAY IS ESSENTIALLY A GOLF-THEMED PRECISE POSITIONING PUZZLE. FURTHERING THIS ASPECT, IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT PACE THE BALL IT AT WHEN IT REACHES THE HOLE (IT NEVER REBOUNDS OUT OF IT) AND THAT REBOUNDS ARE ALWAYS AT PRECISE 90-DEGREE ANGLES WITHOUT TAKING PACE OUT OF THE BALL.

SIXTEEN SHOT ANGLES AND SIXTEEN SHOT PACES ARE AVAILABLE. THE FIRST HOLE IS SIMPLY A ROW OF VERTICALLY-PLACED BARRIERS WITH ONLY SMALL GAPS AT EACH END, BUT LATER HOLES INCLUDE RANDOMLY-PLACED BALL-SIZED BLOCKS, CURVED BARRIERS ALMOST ENCLOSING THE HOLE, AND SQUARE BLOCKADES LEAVING ONLY NARROW CORRIDORS TO PLAY (BOUNCE, MORE EFFECTIVELY) THE BALL THROUGH. THE FINAL HOLE COMBINES ALL THESE FOR A PAR-12 CHALLENGE.</desc>

		<name>Cruising on Broadway</name>
		<desc>CRUISING IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST COMPUTER GAMES POSSIBLE, AND ONE WHICH PROBABLY HAS BEEN INDEPENDENTLY INVENTED MORE THAN ONE TIME. THE CONCEPT IS SIMILAR TO GAMES SUCH AS CUTHBERT GOES WALKABOUT, IN THAT YOUR GOAL IS TO COLOUR ALL LINES ON THE SCREEN WHILE AVOIDING THE NASTIES THAT MIGHT GET IN YOUR WAY.

UNLIKE THE AFOREMENTIONED GAME, THOUGH, CRUISING DOESN'T SIMPLY DIVIDE THE SCREEN INTO A GRID. INSTEAD, THE LINES MAKE MORE INTRICATE PATTERNS, MORE SO FOR EACH "GRID" THAT YOU CLEAR. ANOTHER FEATURE IS THAT YOU CAN MAKE A CUT IN THE GRID SO THAT THE "CHASER" CAN'T FOLLOW YOU THAT WAY. JUST MAKE SURE NOT TO CUT OFF YOUR OWN ESCAPE ROUTE!</desc>

		<desc>CYRUS II CHESS IS A CHESS PROGRAM, IT IS THE SEQUEL TO THE ACCLAIMED CYRUS WHICH WAS RELEASED IN 1982.

THIS GAME HAS MOST OF THE FEATURES OF THE EARLIER GAME. THE BOARD CAN BE VIEWED IN TOP-DOWN MODE OR IN A 3D ISOMETRIC MODE WITH THE PLAYER BEING ABLE TO SWITCH BETWEEN THE TWO BY PRESSING THE ESC KEY. THERE ARE TWELVE SKILL LEVELS, LEVEL 1 - 9 AFFECT THE TIME THE PLAYER HAS TO MAKE THEIR MOVE FROM JUST 2 SECONDS PER MOVE AT LEVEL 1 THROUGH TO A MAXIMUM OF 3 MINUTES AT LEVEL 8. THE OTHER THREE SKILL LEVELS ARE ADAPTIVE WHERE CYRUS PLAYS AT THE SAME RATE AS ITS OPPONENT, INFINITE WHERE CYRUS WILL KEEP ON THINKING UNTIL TOLD TO MAKE A MOVE, AND PROBLEM WHERE CYRUS SEARCHES FOR MATE IN FIVE MOVES OR LESS.

OTHER FEATURES INCLUDE WATCHING THE COMPUTER PLAY ITSELF, SWITCHING SIDES, RETRACTING AND REPLAYING MOVES, A HINT FACILITY, AND BEING ABLE TO SET UP CHESS PROBLEMS FOR CYRUS TO SOLVE.

THERE IS ALSO SUPPORT FOR A PRINTER SO THAT EITHER THE CURRENT BOARD OR THE CONTENTS OF CYRUS' MEMORY CONTAINING THE CURRENT POSITION PLUS RECENT MOVES CAN BE PRINTED AT ANY TIME. ADDITIONALLY THE GAME CAN BE PRINTED MOVE BY MOVE AS IT PROGRESSES TO PRESERVE THE FULL RECORD.</desc>

EACH ONE HAS ITS OWN WORLD RECORD, AND A TARGET TIME / DISTANCE / SCORE TO REACH - FAIL AND YOU LOSE ONE OF YOUR THREE LIVES. AFTER COMPLETING ALL EVENTS SUCCESSFULLY THEY REPEAT WITH TOUGHER TARGETS.

ROWING, 100M AND CYCLING ARE PURE TESTS OF JOYSTICK WAGGLING, AND THIS IS A FEATURE OF MAY OTHER EVENTS. THE PENALTY SHOOT-OUT INVOLVES TIMING THE RUN-UP THEN PRESSING FIRE TO SET THE ANGLE OF THE SHOT. IN THE SKI-JUMP, TIMING THE LAUNCH AND LANDING ARE CRUCIAL. THE TUG OF WAR INVOLVES CHOOSING A CANDIDATE YOU FEEL YOU CAN BEAT AND THEN OUT-WAGGLING THEM.

IN THE TRIPLE JUMP YOU MUST RUN TO THE LINE BEFORE HOLDING DOWN FIRE FOR THE RIGHT LENGTH OF TIME FOR EACH OF THE 3 PHASES OF THE JUMP (45 DEGREES IS OPTIMAL). THE HURDLES EVENT INVOLVES RUNNING TO AND PRESSING FIRE TO CLEAR THE HURDLES. 

PISTOL SHOOTING GIVES YOU LIMITED TIME TO CORRECTLY MOVE A SIGHT INTO POSITION, BEFORE FIRING AS CLOSE TO THE CENTRE AS POSSIBLE. THIS IS MADE HARDER BY ONLY BEING ABLE TO MOVE UP AND TOWARDS THE TARGET, WHICH PREVENTS BEING ABLE TO CORRECT OVER-MOVEMENT.</desc>

YOU MUST PICK THEM UP AND QUICKLY THROW THEM OUT OF THE BUILDING TO SAFETY - FAILURE TO DO THIS COSTS YOU A DROID AND A ROOM (OCCASIONALLY BLOCKING OFF OTHER ESSENTIAL ROOMS). THE GAME'S LEVELS HAVE GRID-LIKE ARRANGEMENTS WITH DOORS, TRAPDOORS AND POLES, AND INCREASE IN SIZE AS THE GAME GOES ON. FOR BOTH THESE REASONS, MAPPING IS ESSENTIAL.

SECURITY DROIDS ARE ON PATROL, BUT THESE CAN BE TRICKED INTO FALLING DOWN HOLES. A COMPUTER ROOM IS THE HUB OF YOUR ACTIVITIES - THIS ALLOWS YOU TO USE TELEPORTS AND TURN OFF FORCE FIELDS, VIA THE APPROPRIATE CIRCUIT BOARDS WHICH ARE HIDDEN THROUGHOUT THE LEVELS. ON LATER LEVELS THE GRAVITY ISN'T CONSTANT AND YOU WILL FIND ROOMS WITH DISTORTED DIRECTIONAL SENSES, INCREASING THE PRECISION REQUIRED SIGNIFICANTLY.</desc>

		<desc>THE ACTOR CHARLES BRONSON PLAYED THE ICONIC ROLE OF VIGILANTE PAUL KERSEY IN 5 MOVIES WHERE HE TAKES THE LAW INTO HIS OWN HANDS WHEN HE DOESN'T GET JUSTICE AND CRIMINALS GET OFF.  THIS GAME IS BASED ON DEATH WISH 3 WHICH CAME OUT IN 1985.  A FRIEND OF KERSEY IN NEW YORK HAS BEEN KILLED AND HE TAKES TO THE STREETS TO HELP THE POLICE LAY WASTE TO GANGS THAT ARE BRUTALIZING AND RIOTING IN THE CITY.

HE HAS A BULLETPROOF VEST THAT WILL PROTECT HIM FROM SEVERAL SHOTS AND CAN WIELD 4 GUNS: THE 475 WILDEY MAGNUM, SHOTGUN, MACHINE GUN, AND ROCKET LAUNCHER.  AVOID SHOOTING GRANNIES ON THE STREETS, MEAN STREET-WALKERS AND THE POLICE WHO OCCASIONALLY WILL HELP YOU TAKE OUT THE BADDIES.  IF YOU START SHOOTING POLICEMEN, THEY WILL TURN ON YOU TOO.    
THE UPPER HALF OF THE SCREEN SHOWS YOU THE SIDE-VIEW OF THE STREET OR BUILDING YOU ARE IN.  THE LOWER HALF SHOWS YOUR SCORE, HIGH SCORE, INJURY METER, A SCROLLING POLICE REPORT SO YOU CAN KNOW WHERE CRIME IS TAKING PLACE, A COMPASS DIRECTION, A MAP WHICH WILL ALSO SHOW YOU WHERE WEAPONS AND BOSSES ARE LOCATED, AND WHICH WEAPON YOU ARE HOLDING AND THE AMMO LEFT.  
WHEN YOU ENTER A BUILDING, YOU CAN FIRE OUT THE WINDOW FOR HIGHER POINTS BUT BEWARE OF ENEMIES THAT MAY COME UP BEHIND YOU.</desc>

EACH STAGE STARTS WITH 2 BIKES TO SHOOT OUT, ALTHOUGH PLANES AND TANKS ALSO APPEAR ON THE HORIZON, TO BE SHOT FOR BONUS POINTS. YOU START WITH 3 BIKES AND AN INFINITE SUPPLY OF BULLETS, WITH ONE BIKE LOST EVERY TIME YOU CRASH.

THE LEVELS ARE TREE-LINED, AND AT TOP SPEED IT CAN BE TERRIFYING AS YOU TRY TO MUSCLE THROUGH THE GAPS SO AS NOT TO LOSE DISTANCE ON THE TARGET BIKE. EVERY SECOND LEVEL IS PLAYED OUT AT NIGHT, WHICH CHANGES THE COLOUR SCHEME.</desc>

		<desc>THERE'S PLENTY OF REFLECTION IN THIS GAME, IN BOTH SENSES OF THE WORD. THAT'S BECAUSE THIS STRATEGIC PUZZLER INVOLVES USING MIRRORS TO DIRECT A BEAM OF LIGHT ACROSS A SUCCESSION OF 60 SCREENS. EACH MIRROR HAS 16 DIFFERENT ANGLES IT CAN BE SET AT, EACH OF WHICH WILL SEND THE BEAM AROUND THE SCREEN IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

BEFORE THE EXIT IS ACTIVATED, ALL THE MINES ON A SCREEN MUST BE CLEARED BY RUNNING THE BEAM OVER THEM. THERE ARE OTHER DEVICES BUILT INTO THE LEVELS, INCLUDING TELEPORTS AND RANDOM ANGLE-CHANGERS, AS WELL AS HAZARDS TO AVOID (THEY CAUSE THE BEAM TO OVERHEAT) AND DROIDS WHICH GO AROUND MOVING THE MIRRORS' DIRECTIONS.</desc>

		<name>Delta</name>
		<desc>DELTA IS A HORIZONTALLY SCROLLING SHOOTER COMPUTER GAME ORIGINALLY RELEASED FOR THE COMMODORE 64 BY THALAMUS LTD IN 1987. IT WAS PROGRAMMED BY STAVROS FASOULAS AND THE MUSIC WAS WRITTEN BY ROB HUBBARD. THE MENU-MUSIC IS BASED ON THE THEME OF KOYAANISQATSI BY PHILIP GLASS AND THE IN-GAME-MUSIC IS BASED ON PINK FLOYD'S ON THE RUN. THE GAME WAS ALSO RELEASED FOR THE ZX SPECTRUM IN 1990 AS DELTA CHARGE.

THE GAME WAS RELEASED AS DELTA PATROL IN THE UNITED STATES BY ELECTRONIC ARTS FOR ITS AMAZING SOFTWARE LINE OF ACTION-ORIENTED SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, IN 1987 ON THE COMMODORE 64.[1]

THE PLAYER CONTROLS A SPACESHIP AND GAINS POWER-UP POINTS BY DESTROYING FORMATIONS OF ENEMIES. SOME ENEMY FORMATIONS INSTEAD SUBTRACT POWER-UP POINTS FOR THE PLAYER, SO THE PLAYER MUST TAKE NOTE OF WHICH FORMATIONS TO DESTROY. PERIODICALLY BLOCKS CONTAINING THE POWER-UPS (HIGHER SPEED, FASTER RATE OF FIRE) APPEAR AND THE PLAYER CAN PICK ONE OF THEM UP: THE MORE POINTS THE PLAYER HAS COLLECTED, THE MORE POWERFUL ARE THE POWER-UPS THAT CAN BE CHOSEN. UNAVAILABLE POWER-UPS ARE GRAY AND KILL THE PLAYER IF HE FLIES INTO THEM, MAKING THEM PART OF THE OBSTACLES IN THE GAME. THE EFFECTS OF THE POWER-UPS ARE LOST OVER TIME AND MUST THEREFORE BE REGAINED. THE PLAYER GETS A CHOICE BETWEEN IN-GAME MUSIC OR IN-GAME SOUND EFFECTS. THERE IS ALSO A HIGH SCORE TABLE BUT NO WAY TO SAVE IT WHEN THE GAME IS TURNED OFF.

THE GAME TITLE MUSIC WAS COVERED BY DESERT PLANET IN THEIR 2003 ALBUM JOYSTICK POP.</desc>

		<name>Doomdark's Revenge</name>
		<desc>THE FOLLOW-UP TO THE ORIGINAL LORDS OF MIDNIGHT GAME USES A SIMILAR GAME SYSTEM TO ITS PREDECESSOR, BUT THE STORY IS NOW MUCH MORE COMPLEX. LUXOR THE MOONPRINCE'S SON MORKIN HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED BY SHARETH, DAUGHTER OF DOOMDARK, THE EVIL RULER DEPOSED IN THE FIRST GAME. THE PLAYER INITIALLY TAKES CONTROL OF LUXOR, ROTHRON THE WISE, AND MORKIN'S LOVER TARITHEL THE FEY, ALTHOUGH MANY MORE CHARACTERS CAN BE RECRUITED AS THE GAME PROGRESSES, AS THEY AIM TO BANISH SHARETH AND RESCUE MORKIN. SHARETH HAS BRAINWASHED HIM, SO HE MUST ALSO BE TURNED BACK TO LUXOR'S SIDE.

THE GAME IS EFFECTIVELY TURN-BASED; YOUR CHARACTERS MOVE BY DAY (WITH A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MOVEMENT POSSIBLE, WITH EACH MOVE IN ONE OF THE 8 COMPASS DIRECTIONS) AND SHARETH'S BY NIGHT. YOU WILL FIND PLAINS, MOUNTAINS, FORESTS, UNDERGROUND TUNNELS AND MYSTERIOUS TEMPLES ON YOUR JOURNEY. A DARK MIST FOLLOWS MUCH OF THE AREA, WHICH CAUSES YOUR CHARACTERS TO DETERIORATE IN MOOD AND THUS BECOME LESS EFFECTIVE.

THE CHARACTERS ARE NOW SPLIT INTO FIVE DISTINCT TRIBES - GIANT, DWARF, FEY, ICEMARK AND BARBARIANS, AND RECRUITING NEW CHARACTERS INTO YOUR PARTY ISN'T AUTOMATIC - FACTORS SUCH AS THE GAME SITUATION CAN MAKE SOME REFUSE TO JOIN, TURN ON MEMBERS OF OTHER RACES, OR DEFECT (AS THE UTARG DID IN THE FIRST GAME).

THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES AND POSSIBLE OUTCOMES TO THE GAME. BRINGING MORKIN BACK TO THE GATES OF VARENORN IS THE MOST BASIC ONE, BUT MANY OTHER CHARACTERS OUGHT TO BE SAVED, SHARETH CAN BE KILLED COMPLETELY (WITH PRACTICE!), AND THERE ARE MANY CROWNS OF ICEMARK TO BE RETRIEVED. AS IN THE FIRST GAME, CONTROL OF THE FULL PARTY ONLY REMAINS WHILE LUXOR IS ALIVE - HIS DEATH MEANS TOTAL DEFEAT.</desc>

WHEN HE AND HIS COLLEAGUE LOEG MEET A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN NAMED SKAR IN AN INN, THEY DO NOT SUSPECT THAT SHE IS A SPY, AND WILL KIDNAP LOEG TO THE SECRET CITY OF DUN DARACH (THE 'OAK FORT' IN CELTIC). CUCHULAINN WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS, AND SETS OFF TO DUN DARACH TO RESCUE HIM. THIS WILL INVOLVE SECONDARY QUESTS BEING COMPLETED ALONG THE WAY.

THE GAME SYSTEM IS IDENTICAL TO THAT OF TIR NA NOG  A SINGLE ROAD OF THE CITY IS SHOWN AT A TIME, WHICH CAN BE WALKED ALONG TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT. WHEN YOU COME TO A JUNCTION, THE VIEW CAN BE ROTATED BY 90 DEGREE TO ALLOW THIS PATH TO BE FOLLOWED. GAMEPLAY IS ALSO SIMILAR - SWORD FIGHTS MUST BE WON AND WORD-BASED PUZZLES SOLVED, ALTHOUGH UNLIKE TIR NA NOG YOU CANNOT DIE.

TRADE AND MONEY MANAGEMENT PLAYS A BIGGER PART THAN BEFORE - OBJECTS CAN BE OFFERED TO, SOLD TO AND STOLEN FROM OTHERS, AND YOU GET OBTAIN JOBS FOR MONEY. WATCH OUT FOR RYDE THE POLICEMAN - IF HE FINDS YOU WITH STOLEN GOODS, EVERYTHING YOU ARE CARRYING WILL BE TAKEN. YOU MUST ALSO SPEAK TO PEOPLE AND ENTER MAGIC ROOMS TO OBTAIN KEY INFORMATION.</desc>

		<name>Elevator Action</name>
		<desc>YOU ARE AGENT 17 (CODENAME: "OTTO"). YOUR MISSION IS TO SECURE ALL TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS FROM A SECURITY BUILDING AND ESCAPE IN THE GETAWAY CAR, LOCATED IN THE BASEMENT OF THE BUILDING.

ENEMIES SPIES ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE 30-FLOOR BUILDING AND THEY HAVE ONLY ONE MISSION: EXECUTE AGENT 17 AT ALL COSTS. THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS IN WHICH AGENT 17 CAN KILL THEM:

1. SHOOTING THEM WITH HIS GUN.
2. KICKING THEM BY JUMPING ONTO THEM.
3. SHOOTING A LIGHT ON THE CEILING WHILE IN AN ELEVATOR, DROPPING THE LIGHT ONTO ONE OF THEM.
4. CRUSHING THEM WITH AN ELEVATOR.

WHENEVER A LIGHT HAS BEEN DROPPED, THE HALLWAYS WILL BE DARK FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, MAKING THE ENEMY SPIES HARDER TO SEE. THE SAME HOLDS TRUE FOR HALLWAYS THAT ARE ALREADY DARK.

WHILE OTTO IS IN AN ELEVATOR, HE WILL HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OF IT BY MOVING UP OR DOWN. AGENT 17 CAN STILL GET KILLED IF HE'S ALREADY IN AN ELEVATOR IF A BULLET'S TRAJECTORY IS AIMED AT IT.. WHEN OTTO IS NOT IN AN ELEVATOR, IT WILL MOVE FROM FLOOR TO FLOOR AUTOMATICALLY, EVEN WHEN ENEMY SPIES ARE IN IT. OTTO IS ABLE TO LEAP OVER THE ELEVATOR GAPS, BUT HE MUST BE AS CLOSE TO THE EDGE AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT FALLING OFF IN ORDER TO MAKE THE JUMP SAFELY. IF THERE IS AN ELEVATOR CABLE IN THE WAY, HOWEVER, IT WILL BLOCK HIM, CAUSING HIM TO FALL. 

JUST BECAUSE THE GAME IS CALLED ELEVATOR ACTION DOESN'T MEAN THAT ELEVATORS ARE THE ONLY MEANS OF TRAVEL. THERE ARE ALSO ESCALATORS WHICH YOU CAN RIDE UP OR DOWN, USEFUL IF YOU WANT TO AVOID GUNFIRE AND DON'T HAVE TIME TO JUMP.

OTTO MUST GO INTO THE ROOMS WITH RED DOORS TO COLLECT THE TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS. IF HE TRIES TO GET TO HIS CAR WITHOUT GETTING ALL THE DOCUMENTS, HE CANNOT ESCAPE AND MUST GO BACK AND COLLECT THE REMAINING DOCUMENTS. ONCE HE HAS ALL THE DOCUMENTS AND DRIVES AWAY, HE THEN PROCEEDS TO THE NEXT BUILDING.

IF OTTO TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO COLLECT THE DOCUMENTS, THE ALARM WILL GO OFF, AND HE WILL HAVE TROUBLE CONTROLLING THE ELEVATORS, WHICH WILL TAKE TIME TO REACT. BAD GUYS WILL BE ESPECIALLY AGGRESSIVE. THE ALARM DOESN'T GO OFF WHEN OTTO LOSES A LIFE, IT ONLY RESETS AFTER FINISHING A BUILDING. BESIDES DUCKING, BAD GUYS MAY ALSO DROP THEMSELVES AND LAY FLAT ON THE FLOOR. IT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR OTTO TO SHOOT BAD GUYS WHEN THEY DO THIS. ALSO, OTTO CANNOT DUCK WHEN IN AN ELEVATOR.</desc>

THE CHILL COMING OUT OF THE REFRIGERATOR INDUCES A DREAM OF THE SWISS ALPS, WITH GARFIELD GOING AFTER THE LARGEST LASAGNA FACTORY IN THE WORLD AND A MYTHICAL CHICKEN THAT CAN LAY CHOCOLATE EGGS. IT IS THE PLAYER'S GOAL TO MAKE SURE GARFIELD'S DREAM COMES TO A HAPPY ENDING BEFORE HE WAKES UP. 

GARFIELD: WINTER'S TAIL COMPRISES OF THREE DIFFERENT MINI-GAMES.THE FIRST ONE HAS GARFIELD SKIING DOWNHILL TOWARDS A SKI-JUMP THAT WILL LEAD HIM STRAIGHT TO THE ROOFTOP OF THE LASAGNA FACTORY. THE SECOND MINI-GAME IS SET IN THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY WHERE THE MYTHICAL CHICKEN IS EMPLOYED: GARFIELD MUST ENSURE ALL THE MECHANICAL CHICKENS IN THE FACTORY ARE PROVIDED THEIR CHOCOLATE SUPPLY FLOWING THROUGH A PIPELINE. FINALLY, HE MUST ICE-SKATE ACROSS A FROZEN LAKE, FOLLOWING THE TRAIL OF CHOCOLATE FOOTSTEPS LEFT BY THE CHICKEN.

AS A DISTURBING ELEMENT, ODIE APPEARS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE GAME. THE DROOLING DOG CAN STEAL SOME OF THE FOOD GARFIELD NEEDS TO REPLENISH HIS ENERGY, BUT HE CAN ALSO TAMPER WITH THE LIFT CONTROLS IN THE FACTORY AND SAW HOLES IN THE FROZEN LAKE.

THE THREE MINI-GAMES CAN BE PLAYED IN ANY ORDER. HOWEVER, PLAYING THE WHOLE GAME FROM THE SKIING LEVEL FIRST IS THE ONLY WAY TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE ENDING.</desc>

		<desc>GYRON IS MADE UP OF TWO MAZES,  THERE'S THE ATRIUM,  AN EASIER AND MORE LINEAR MAZE WHICH ACTS AS AN INTRODUCTION TO THE GAME AND THE NECROPOLIS,  WHICH IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. THE OBJECT OF NECROPOLIS IS TO FIND THE "PLACE OF WISDOM" HIDDEN SOMEWHERE DEEP WITHIN THE MAZE. YOU CONTROL A CRAFT CALLED THE "HEDROID". 

VECTOR GRAPHICS ALLOW FOR FAST FORWARD ACCELERATION OR SLOWER MORE PRECISE MOVEMENTS. COLLISIONS WITH THE MAZE WALLS CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE HEDROID,  COLLISIONS AT GREATER SPEED CAUSE GREATER DAMAGE, TOO MUCH DAMAGE AND IT'S BACK TO SQUARE ONE

TOWERS ARE POSITIONED ON TOP OF THE MAZE WALLS,  THEY CAN ONLY SHOOT IN THE DIRECTION THEY ARE FACING,  BUT GET IN THEIR LINE OF FIRE AND IT'LL BE ALMOST INSTANT DEATH. SHOOTING THE TOWERS FROM BEHIND CAN HAVE A VARIETY OF EFFECTS,  AND YOU'LL NEED TO DO THIS TO GET THROUGH THE GAME - THE TOWER CAN TURN,  DISAPPEAR(POSSIBLY RE-APPEAR ELSEWHERE) AND CHANGE THE ORIENTATION OF OTHER TOWERS - THIS CAN RESULT IN NEW ROUTES BECOMING AVAILABLE OR PERHAPS ENDING UP SUDDENLY IN THE LINE OF FIRE. VERY LARGE AND DANGEROUS SPHERES MOVE IN FIXED PATTERNS AROUND THE MAZE,  YOU'LL HAVE TO TIME YOUR PASSAGE PAST THEM CAREFULLY AS CONTACT RESULTS IN INSTANT DEATH.  THE SCANNER INDICATES THE MAZE PATHS/WALLS,  POSITION AND ORIENTATION OF TOWERS AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE SPHERES - SHOOTING TOWERS CAN HAVE AN EFFECT IN AREAS OF THE MAZE NOT COVERED BY THE LOCAL RANGE OF THE SCANNER

A COUPLE OF TACTICS TO AVOID THE TOWERS LINE OF SIGHT INVOLVE USING THE SPHERES AS COVER,  AND HUGGING THE WALL OF THE TRENCH AT THE BASE OF THE TOWERS. BOTH THE ATRIUM AND NECROPOLIS MAZES HAVE TWELVE ZONES - INDICATED BY THE COLOUR OF THE SPINNING ICOSAHEDRON.</desc>

		<desc>RELEASING A GAME WHICH RESEMBLES A WELL-KNOWN ARCADE GAME BEFORE ANY OFFICIAL LICENSE CAN BE RELEASED WAS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE FOR PUBLISHERS, AND IN THIS CASE MELBOURNE HOUSE RELEASED A GAME SIMILAR TO MARBLE MADNESS. CONTROLLING A GYROSCOPE, YOU MOST NAVIGATE YOUR WAY DOWN A SLOPING TRACK FULL OF HAZARDS. THE VIEWPOINT IS IN FIXED ISOMETRIC 3D, WITH HAZARDS INCLUDING BUILDINGS, RAMPS AND DROPS. THE GYROSCOPE ACCELERATES QUICKLY AND TAKES TIME TO SLOW DOWN, SO IT IS EASY TO GO INTO A SCREEN TOO FAST.

FAILING TO KEEP THE GYROSCOPE SPINNING FREELY AS IT NAVIGATES THESE COSTS YOU ONE OF YOUR SEVEN LIVES. YOU ARE ALSO PLAYING WITHIN A TIME LIMIT - LOSING A LIFE SEES YOU RETURN TO THE START OF A LEVEL WITHOUT REGAINING LOST TIME, BUT RUNNING OUT OF TIME SEES YOU LOSE A LIFE, BUT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE FROM WHERE YOU WERE LEFT WITH A NEW SET OF TIME (SO, AS WITH CHASE HQ, COMPLETING TRICKY LEVELS CAN TAKE 2 OR 3 LIVES AT FIRST). 

YOU GET TIME BONUSES FOR COMPLETING A SCREEN, POINTS BONUSES FOR COMPLETING ONE OF THE SEVEN FOUR-SCREEN LEVELS, AND AN EXTRA LIFE FOR REACHING 1000 POINTS.
AT THE END OF LEVEL 7, YOU WILL GET 1000 POINTS FOR EACH REMAINING LIVES, DOUBLING YOUR CURRENT AMOUNT OF LIVES. YOU WILL THEN START AGAIN AT LEVEL 1 BUT MIRRORED BY THE VERTICAL AXIS (YOU ARE NOW CLIMBING FROM THE BOTTOM OF SCREEN TO THE TOP).
AFTER LEVEL 14 (LEVEL 7 MIRROR), YOU WILL AGAIN WIN 1000 POINTS FOR EACH REMAINING LIVES AND THEN THE GAME LOOP ON LEVEL 1 (NOT MIRRORED).</desc>

		<desc>IN A GRIM FUTURE, THE PEOPLE ARE KEPT UNDER CONTROL BY A HORDE OF GENETICALLY-MODIFIED BEINGS WHO LOOK IDENTICAL TO EVERYONE ELSE, AND APPEAR TO ACT THE SAME, BUT ARE SUBTLY CONTROLLING MINDS AND ACTIONS. THIS WORKS PERFECTLY FOR CENTRO-HOLOGRAPHIS UNTIL TWO OF THEIR DROIDS, HAMMERFIST (MALE) AND METALISIS (FEMALE) MALFUNCTION. THEY TRY TO PUT THINGS RIGHT, AND COME UNDER YOUR CONTROL IN THIS SIDE-VIEW ACTION GAME WITH ADVENTURE ELEMENTS.

YOU CAN SWITCH BETWEEN THE TWO CHARACTERS AT ANY MOMENT, AND MUST USE THIS WISELY AS THEIR ABILITIES DIFFER GREATLY. ON EACH SCREEN YOU MUST KILL ALL ENEMIES, AS WELL AS TAKING OUT THE ROBOTS WHICH KEEP THE DOORS LOCKED.</desc>

EDOS HAS ONLY ONE SOURCE OF ENERGY: THE GIANT CAPACITOID CRYSTALS, CAPABLE OF STORING ENERGY BY DAY AND REGENERATE THAT ENERGY DURING THE ICY COLD NIGHTS. HAVING REALIZED THIS, THE EVIL NEVIK WARRIORS DECIDED TO STEAL ALL BUT TWO OF THESE CRYSTALS, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SUSTAIN NORMAL LIFE ON THE PLANET. AS A RESULT, ALL OF THE PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO GO IN A LIFE SUSPENSION PROGRAM, EXCEPT HAWK, WHO MUST RECOVER ALL THIRTY-TWO STOLEN CRYSTALS IF EDOS IS TO SURVIVE.

THE NEVIKS ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT EDOS TO MAKE SURE THAT HAWK DOES NOT SUCCEED IN HIS QUEST, BUT HAWK CAN COLLECT UP TO THREE DIFFERENT WEAPONS  SHIELDS, MINES, AND STRYDERS  THAT CAN BE USED AGAINST THEM. ALSO SCATTERED AROUND ARE VARIOUS HAZARDS SUCH AS FIREPITS, SLIMEBALLS, SPIKES, AND GUN TURRETS, WHICH CAN CAUSE HAWK TO LOSE SOME ENERGY IF HE COLLIDES INTO THEM. THERE ARE SEVERAL OBJECTS WHICH HAWK CAN USE TO HIS ADVANTAGE. ENERGY PODS CAN RESTORE HIS ENERGY, LIFTS CAN BE USED TO REACH HIGHER PLATFORMS, AND TELEPORTS CAN TAKE HIM TO DIFFERENT AREAS.</desc>

THE ROAD IS FULL OF CARS AND BIKES, CONTACT WITH EACH OF WHICH COSTS $10 IN AMBULANCE FEES OUT OF YOUR STARTING $40, AND THE SKIS THEMSELVES COST $10.

THE ACTUAL SKIING SECTION HAS A PSEUDO-3D VIEW, SIMILAR TO A ROVING CAMERA MOUNTED ABOVE THE COURSE. YOUR TASK IS TO CUT BETWEEN THE RED AND BLUE SETS OF FLAGS, WITHOUT HITTING ANY OF THE TREES ON THE COURSE. LIGHT CONTACT WITH THESE WILL ALLOW YOU TO CARRY ON; HEAVY CONTACT BREAKS YOUR SKIS AND SENDS YOU BACK TO THE FIRST SECTION OF THE GAME (WHICH YOU ALSO RETURN TO AFTER COMPLETING EACH OF THE COURSES).</desc>

THE AIM OF THE GAME IS TO DESTROY YOUR OWN BRICKS BEFORE YOUR OPPONENT CAN DESTROY HIS. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY CATCHING THE SMALL BY POINTING YOUR SUCTION DEVICE AT IT AND HOLDING FIRE, AND THEN RELEASING IN THE NEEDED BY LETTING GO OF THE BUTTON. THIS IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE, AS THE BALL NEITHER MOVES IN A STRAIGHT LINE OR ACCORDING TO THE NATURAL RULES OF.GRAVITY.

SHOULD EITHER PLAYER BE HIT WITH THE BALL AND NOT CATCH IT PROPERLY, THEY WILL BE KNOCKED DOWN AND POSSESSION OF THE BALL IS PASSED TO THE OTHER PLAYER.</desc>

KNIGHT TYME IS THE THIRD GAME OF THE MAGIC KNIGHT SERIES. AS IN SPELLBOUND, THE PREVIOUS GAME, THE PLAYER INTERACTS WITH THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH THE "WINDIMATION" SYSTEM: PRESSING A BUTTON BRINGS UP A WINDOW WITH A LIST OF COMMANDS (PICK UP/DROP/TAKE/GIVE AN OBJECT, EXAMINE, COMMAND A CHARACTER, READ SOMETHING, CAST A SPELL AND WEAR/UNWEAR OBJECT). THE PLAYER CAN SCROLL THROUGH THESE WITH THE MOVEMENT KEYS, AND EXECUTE THEM WITH THE SAME BUTTON USED BEFORE. SPACEFLIGHT IS PART OF THE GAMEPLAY AS THE SHIP MUST VISIT SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLANETS. THE SPACESHIP HAS TO BE REFUELED, OTHERWISE THE CHARACTER WILL BE STUCK FOREVER IN SPACE. THERE ARE ROOMS THAT KILL THE KNIGHT INSTANTANEOUSLY. USUALLY THERE IS A PUZZLE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ROOMS THAT MUST BE SOLVED IN ORDER TO ACCESS THEM.</desc>

		<desc>WITH THE SCROLLS NOW IN HIS POSSESSION, THE LAST NINJA BEGINS TRAINING A NEW ORDER OF NINJA. DURING A TRAINING SESSION HE IS MYSTERIOUSLY TRANSPORTED TO XXTH-CENTURY NEW YORK. THE EVIL SHOGUN HAS RETURNED! TORN FROM HIS OWN TIME, THE LAST NINJA MUST DEFEND HIMSELF ONCE MORE WITH NOTHING MORE THAN THE BELIEF IN HIS OWN ABILITIES. 

LAST NINJA 2: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE IS AN ACTION/ADVENTURE GAME WHERE THE PLAYER, CONTROLLING A POWERFUL NINJA, MUST FIGHT HIS WAY THROUGH OPPONENTS WHILE COLLECTING NECESSARY ITEMS. THE GAME IS SPLIT INTO VARIOUS LEVELS, EACH OF THEM DEPICTING A DIFFERENT LOCALE AND DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL SCREENS. THE VIEW IS ISOMETRIC AND THE NINJA CAN MOVE IN FOUR DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS (HE CAN ALSO WALK BACKWARDS) AND JUMP. 

ENEMIES, ARMED WITH FISTS AND VARIOUS NINJA WEAPONS, WANDER AROUND THE LEVELS. THE NINJA MUST FIGHT THEM EITHER BARE-HANDED OR WITH THE WEAPONRY HE FINDS ALONG THE WAY; IN EITHER CASE, HE HAS A NUMBER OF BLOWS AND ATTACKS AT HIS DISPOSAL, AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO BLOCK. THERE'S A SPECIAL WEAPON, SHURIKEN, WHICH ARE THROWN IN A STRAIGHT LINE RATHER THAN USED FOR MELEE COMBAT; IF THEY STRIKE AN ENEMY, THEY'LL INSTANTLY KILL OR AT LEAST HEAVILY DAMAGE HIM. 

THERE ARE ITEMS SCATTERED AROUND THE LEVELS, SUCH AS KEYS, ROPE, A MAP OR HAMBURGERS (WHICH RESTORE HEALTH WHEN EATEN). COLLECTING THESE ITEMS AND USING THEM IN A PROPER PLACE IS NECESSARY FOR COMPLETING THE GAME.</desc>

THE EMPIRE HAS SENT ROBOTIC GUARDS DOWN TO PROTECT THE GOLD, AND CONTACT WITH ANY OF THESE WILL COST YOU A LIFE. YOUR METHOD OF ESCAPING THEM IS TO PRESS FIRE TO DIG A HOLE IN THEIR LINE OF MOVEMENT, THUS CAUSING THEM TO FALL IN BRIEFLY, ALLOWING YOU TO MOVE ACROSS THE GAP SAFELY. ONCE ALL THE GOLD HAS BEEN COLLECTED, A LADDER ALLOWING YOU TO MOVE ONTO THE NEXT SCREEN IS ADDED. COMPLETING THESE SCREENS OFTEN REQUIRES FORWARD PLANNING AND PRECISION.

		<desc>THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES ARE NOT SAFE. LATELY, THE KIDS ARE SICK AND TIRED OF PARENTS ORDERING THEM ABOUT AND TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO, SO THEY DECIDE TO GO OUT ON THE STREETS AND THREATEN TO CLUB EVERY POLICEMAN WHO GETS IN THEIR WAY, MAKING THE STREETS NOT SAFE FOR THE PUBLIC, NOT EVEN FOR LITTLE OLD LADIES WHO DECIDE TO TAKE A WALK ON A SUNNY DAY.

THE BAD NEWS IS: YOU'RE A POLICE OFFICER PATROLLING THE STREETS, AND YOU HAVE TWO OTHER POLICE OFFICERS AT YOUR SIDE. YOUR JOB IS TO SHOOT THE LITTLE TROUBLEMAKERS THAT APPROACH YOU. THESE TROUBLEMAKERS ARE HARMLESS AT A DISTANCE, BUT THEY ARE KNOWN TO THROW FIRE BOMBS AT A FEW POLICEMEN. WHEN YOU ARE KILLED BY ONE OF THE TROUBLEMAKERS, ONE OF THE POLICEMEN REPLACES YOU AS THE ONE WHO GETS TO CONTROL THE STREETS. IF THERE IS NO POLICEMEN LEFT, THE GAME IS OVER.

THERE ARE ALSO TURRET GUNS LOCATED ON TOP OF BUILDINGS THAT FIRE, SO YOU JUST CAN'T STAY ON THE FOOTPATH AND HOPE NOT TO GET CLOBBERED BY THE TROUBLEMAKERS. YOU JUST HAVE TO CROSS THE ROAD WHICH IS DANGEROUS FOR A POLICEMAN IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. WHEN YOU COME TO THE INTERSECTION, YOU'LL COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH A GANG, AND YOU MUST SHOOT EACH GANG MEMBER BEFORE THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO LEAVE YOU FOR DEAD. ONCE YOU'VE SHOOT ALL REMAINING GANG MEMBERS, A MAN APPEARS HOLDING A WOMAN HOSTAGE. THE OBJECT HERE IS TO SHOOT THE MAN TO FREE HER. IF YOU SHOOT THE WOMAN INSTEAD, YOU'LL SACRIFICE 1000 POINTS.

YOUR SCORE INCREASES WHEN YOU WALK, BUT SCORE MORE POINTS IF YOU MANAGE TO SHOOT A TROUBLEMAKER. YOU'LL LOSE 100 POINTS FOR KILLING A LADY WALKING DOWN THE FOOTPATH.</desc>

MAG MAX IS A SIDE-SCROLLING SHOOTER GAME. AT THE BEGINNING, MAG MAX IS ONLY A TINY LITTLE FIGHTER CRAFT THAT CAN FIRE LOW-POWERED PROJECTILES. AS COMPONENT PIECES ARE FOUND; SUCH AS A HEAD, LEGS AND A LASER LANCE, MAG MAX'S OFFENSIVE POWER INCREASES. ACCESS TO THE UNDERWORLD CAN BE GRANTED THROUGH SMALL DARK CRATERS ON THE LANDSCAPE. ONCE IN THE UNDERWORLD, MAG MAX'S WEAPONS VARY SLIGHTLY AS DO THE ENEMIES (THERE ARE NO STATIONARY OBJECTS UNDERGROUND). ENEMY FIRE OR CONTACT ON EACH OF THE COMPONENTS WILL DESTROY THAT COMPONENT. FIRE ON THE MAIN FIGHTER WILL DESTROY MAG MAX. AT THE END OF EACH LEVEL AWAITS A BOSS CREATURE.</desc>

		<desc>MAGNETRON WAS A FOLLOW-UP TO QUAZATRON.

ROBOT KLP-2 RETURNED TO DESTROY A SERIES OF SPACE STATIONS AROUND THE PLANET QUARTECH. THIS WAS ACHIEVED BY OVERLOADING OR SHUTTING DOWN THE FOUR NUCLEAR REACTORS IN EACH STATION. KLP-2 HAD TO CARRY NUCLEAR FUEL RODS BETWEEN THE REACTORS, WITH EACH ROD HAVING A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE CHARGE AND A WEIGHT. THE MORE WEIGHT BEING CARRIED, THE SLOWER KLP-2 MOVED AND THE HARDER IT WAS TO GET UP SLOPES. THE CHARGE AFFECTED HOW THE ROBOT REACTED TO ARROW TILES ON THE FLOOR - A POSITIVE CHARGE WOULD MOVE THE ROBOT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ARROW, A NEGATIVE CHARGE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

THROUGHOUT THE SPACE STATION WERE COMPUTER SCREENS TO GIVE INFORMATION, IN A VERY SIMILAR METHOD TO PARADROID. ENEMIES CAME IN VARIOUS TYPES AND HAD DIFFERENT WEAPONS, WITH EACH SHOWING A RANK AND DROID NUMBER ON THE FRONT. BY STANDING STILL AND HOLDING DOWN FIRE, KLP-2 ENTERED GRAPPLE MODE. NOW HE COULD RUN INTO AN ENEMY AND TRY TO TAKE CONTROL. THIS GAVE A 9X9 GRID OF SYMBOLS. REARRANGING THE BOTTOM ROW DISARMED THE DETONATOR AND ALLOWED KLP-2 TO STEAL ENERGY FOR A RECHARGE. REARRANGING ALL THREE ROWS ALLOWED KLP-2 TO TAKE OVER THE OTHER ROBOT AND USE ITS ABILITIES AND WEAPONS.

ONCE AT THE REACTOR, KLP-2 COULD ADD OR REMOVE A ROD AT A TIME. THE AIM WAS EITHER TO OVERLOAD (BY GETTING A BIG POSITIVE NUMBER) OR SHUT DOWN (BY GETTING A BIG NEGATIVE NUMBER). WITH ALL FOUR REACTORS SHUT DOWN, THE LIGHTS DIMMED AND KLP-2 WENT TO A BEAM PAD TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STATION.</desc>

IN THIS GAME MATT'S SON HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED BY V.E.N.O.M. AND HAS BEEN TAKEN TO THE MOON. MATT HAS BEEN GIVEN AN ULTIMATUM, DISBAND M.A.S.K. AND LEAVE THE WORLD AT THE MERCY OF V.E.N.O.M., OR NEVER SEE HIS SON ALIVE AGAIN.

MATT SETS OUT FOR THE MOON WHERE HE MUST OVERCOME THE DEFENCES OF V.E.N.O.M.'S BASE, RESCUE HIS SON AND STEAL A ROCKET BACK TO EARTH. 
IN HIS QUEST HE IS HELPED BY SPECIAL MASKS THAT GIVE HIM SPECIAL POWERS. FOR EXAMPLE ONE MASK WILL GIVE MATT THE ABILITY TO SHOOT BULLETS OTHERS WILL ALLOW HIM TO FLY, PASS THROUGH SOLID OBJECTS, FLOAT ACROSS BODIES OF WATER, HAVE TEMPORARY INVULNERABILITY AND SO ON. HOWEVER, MATT CAN ONLY CARRY FOUR MASKS AND CAN ONLY USE ONE MASK AT A TIME. EACH MASK HAS JUST 99 UNITS OF ENERGY, OR BULLETS, AND THIS NUMBER IS REDUCED EACH TIME THE MASK IS USED SO EVENTUALLY THE MASK WILL NEED REPLACING.

AT THE END OF EACH LEVEL AS MATT PROGRESSES TO THE NEXT THE PLAYER GETS A CODE WORD. THIS CODEWORD CAN BE TYPED IN WHEN THE GAME IS RE-LOADED ALLOWING THE PLAYER TO RESTART AT THE NEW LEVEL.</desc>

		<name>Max Headroom</name>
		<desc>THIS GAME IS BASED ON A 1984 BRITISH TELEVISION MOVIE WHICH LED TO A 14-EPISODE TELEVISION SERIES THAT RAN IN 1987 IN THE U.S.  IT'S AN EARLY CYBERPUNK VISION SET "TWENTY MINUTES IN THE FUTURE" WHERE POWERFUL CORPORATIONS RULE AND COMPETE FOR TELEVISION RATINGS AND CONSUMER DOLLARS.  EDISON CARTER IS AN INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER FOR NETWORK 23 SEEKING TO FREE HIS ALTER EGO MAX HEADROOM, A CYBERNETIC CONSTRUCT OF HIS MIND THAT WAS STORED AFTER EDISON WAS INVOLVED IN A MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT AND THE LAST THING HE SAW BEFORE LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS WAS A "MAX HEADROOM" SIGN GOING INTO A TUNNEL.  MAX LIVES IN COMPUTERS AND CAN APPEAR ON ANY SCREEN, TELEVISION OR ANY ELECTRONIC DEVICE.  THE CHARACTER IS ACTUALLY MATT FREWER IN A LATEX MASK, EDITED SO AS TO APPEAR JITTERY AND STUTTERING LIKE AN EARLY COMPUTER MODEL.  

IN THE GAME, MAX HAS BEEN ABDUCTED BY NETWORK 23 AND YOU MUST RETRIEVE HIM FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE 11 TOP FLOORS OF THEIR HIGH-RISE BUILDING STARTING AT THE 200TH FLOOR.  SECURITY SYSTEMS PROTECT EACH FLOOR AND YOU HAVE TO FIND AND ENTER THE CORRECT CODES TO GAIN ACCESS FROM THE ELEVATORS.  EACH FLOOR SEEN IN ISOMETRIC VIEW, HAS LINES REPRESENTING WALLS OF VARIOUS ROOMS WITH DOORS AND OFFICE FURNITURE.  ROBOTS WILL CHASE AND FIRE AT YOU AND DECREASE YOUR HEALTH LEVEL AS SHOWN ON THE BIOMONITOR AT BOTTOM OF SCREEN.  ALSO INDICATED ARE THE FLOOR NUMBER AND TIME LEFT.  ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF SCREEN ARE 4 ICONS FOR REPORTER E. CARTER WHICH OPEN A DOOR, CALL ELEVATOR, VIEW THROUGH CAMERA, OR ALLOW MOVEMENT TO RUN AROUND THE FLOOR.  ON THE LEFT SIDE ARE ICONS FOR CONTROLLER T. JONES (THEORA HELPS YOU HACK INTO SYSTEMS) TO SHOW YOU THE FLOOR AND COMPUTER CIRCUITS.  

WHEN ENTERING A SECURITY CODE, IT TAKES THE FORM OF AN LED DIGIT OVER WHICH YOU MUST MOVE A POINTER OVER A ROW OF CIRCUIT LINES IN ORDER TO ACTIVATE VARIOUS SEGMENTS TO FORM A DESIRED DIGIT.  EACH SEGMENT WILL REMAIN LIT ONLY TEMPORARILY SO WHEN TIME RUNS OUT YOU MUST ENSURE THAT THE LETTER IS FULLY LIT OR YOUR CODE WILL FAIL.  IN THAT EVENT, YOU MUST MAKE YOUR WAY ACROSS THE FLOOR TO THE SECOND ELEVATOR AND TRY AGAIN.</desc>

		<desc>MAZIACS IS A MAZE GAME. THE MAZE IN MAZIACS HAS NO EDGES BUT HAS AROUND 100 LOCATIONS AND A NEW MAZE IS GENERATED AT EACH GAME START. THE AIM OF MAZIACS IS TO FIND THE TREASURE AND TAKE IT TO THE POINT THE GAME STARTED.

ALL SCATTERED OVER THE MAZE ARE PRISONERS, FOOD, SWORDS AND TREASURES FOR YOU TO COLLECT BUT YOU ARE CHASED BY MONSTERS THAT WILL ATTACK YOU.

A SWORD CAN ONLY KILL ONE MAZIAC, A HOSTILE AND HORRIBLE MONSTER AND IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE TO CARRY ONE ITEM AT THE TIME. WITHOUT A SWORD, YOU CAN STILL FIGHT MAZIACS, BUT YOUR CHANCES OF VICTORY ARE MUCH LOWER. 

YOU NEED TO COLLECT FOOD OR YOU WILL DIE OF STARVATION.

TO FIND THE TREASURE YOU SHOULD ASK THE PRISONERS WHO CAN SHOW YOU THE WAY, BUT ONLY FOR A SHORT DISTANCE. THE ROUTE WILL TURN YELLOW FOR A SHORT TIME.

THE PRISONERS WILL ALSO TELL YOU THE WAY BACK TO YOUR STARTING POINT.
AS YOU CAN ONLY CARRY ONE ITEM AT THE TIME IT IS BEST TO KILL AS MANY MAZIACS ON YOUR WAY TO THE TREASURE.</desc>

THIS IS DONE THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DRIVING AND SHOOTING, THROUGH AN OVERHEAD RENDITION OF MIAMI. WHEN CROOKS ARE STOPPED THEY WILL OFTEN PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION, ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES THEY CAN ONLY BE STOPPED BY SHOOTING THEM. 

WHEN YOU LEARN OF A MEETING, YOU CAN ENTER IT ON FOOT, EITHER TO GAIN EVIDENCE OR MAKE AN ARREST - BUT REMEMBER THAT A JOINT FULL OF CROOKS WILL NOT SIMPLY ALLOW YOU TO DO YOUR CIVIC DUTY. THIS IS ALL DONE AGAINST A TIME LIMIT, WITH A ONE-MINUTE PENALTY FOR CRASHING THE CAR.</desc>

		<desc>IN THIS UNOFFICIAL ADAPTATION OF THE FILM "THE JEWEL OF THE NILE", THREE TRAVELERS HAVE BEEN CAPTURED BY A DICTATORIAL REGIME IN AN ARAB COUNTRY. THEY MUST ESCAPE THE COUNTRY AT ONCE, AND THE PLAYER IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN HELP THEM.

IN THE INITIAL SCREENS ALL THREE TOURISTS NEED TO BE REUNITED FROM THEIR DIFFERENT PRISON CELLS. EACH CHARACTER ALSO NEEDS TO FIND THEIR WEAPON OF CHOICE, THOSE BEING GRENADES, A PISTOL AND AN UMBRELLA. CONTROL BETWEEN ANY OF THE TRAVELERS CAN BE SWITCHED AT ANY MOMENT BY TYPING 1, 2 OR 3.

ONCE THE THREE TRAVELERS ARE REUNITED, EVERY SCREEN ACTS AS A PUZZLE OF SORTS: THE PLAYER IS GIVEN A FEW SECONDS TO STRATEGICALLY PLACE EACH CHARACTER BEFORE ENEMIES APPEAR. WHEN THEY DO, TWO OF THE CHARACTERS WILL REACT AUTOMATICALLY TO THE ENEMIES, AND THE PLAYER WILL DIRECTLY CONTROL THE LAST CHARACTER. IF ALL ENEMIES IN THE SCREEN ARE ELIMINATED AND THE THREE CHARACTERS SURVIVE, THEY WILL ADVANCE TO THE NEXT SCREEN.</desc>

MYTH: HISTORY IN THE MAKING IS A PLATFORM GAME WITH A LOT OF FIGHTING. THE LEVELS OF THIS GAME DEAL WITH DIFFERENT MYTHOLOGIES, FROM ANCIENT GREECE TO THE VIKINGS, OVER TO VALHALLA (WHERE NONE OTHER THAN THE HAMMER-WIELDING THOR AWAITS YOU), AND MORE.

APART FROM JUMPING FROM PLATFORM TO PLATFORM, YOU'LL ALSO FIGHT THE ENEMIES AND BOSSES IN YOUR PATH WITH A VARIETY OF WEAPONS - IN THE BEGINNING YOU HAVE ONLY FISTS TO DEFEND YOURSELF, BUT LATER YOU'LL FIND MORE POWERFUL WEAPONS, SUCH AS SWORDS AND AXES. THERE ARE MANY VARIOUS TYPES OF ENEMIES, DIFFERENT ON EVERY LEVEL. TYPICALLY, ENEMIES KEEP APPEARING AND COMING AT YOU FROM ALL SIDES, NO MATTER HOW MANY OF THEM YOU KILL - SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP MOVING. 

SOME OBSTACLES IN THE GAME REQUIRE NOT ONLY BRUTE FORCE, BUT ALSO A BIT OF THINKING AND PUZZLE-SOLVING (AND GUESSWORK) TO GET PAST.</desc>

BEFORE EACH RACE YOU HAVE TO DO THREE QUALIFYING LAPS, AND ONLY MAKE THE GRID IF YOU ARE FAST ENOUGH TO MEET THE PRE-DEFINED QUALIFYING LIMIT. THE RACES CAN BE BETWEEN 5 AND 20 LAPS, OR AT FULL LENGTH IF YOU PREFER - FORTUNATELY A HALF-FINISHED SEASON CAN BE SAVED TO CASSETTE OR DISK. 

F1 CARS OF THIS ERA HAVE TURBO BOOSTS, AND THIS IS AVAILABLE IN THE GAME TO PROVIDE A QUICK BLAST OF EXTRA SPEED, WHICH IS USEFUL FOR OVERTAKING BUT CAN CAUSE THE TURBO OR THE ENGINE ITSELF TO BE OVERSTRESSED, AS WELL AS USING FUEL MORE QUICKLY (PITSTOPS ARE FOR TIRES BUT NOT FUEL, AGAIN IN KEEPING WITH THE ERA'S REAL FORMULA 1 RULES).</desc>

SECONDLY, IT'S ISOMETRICALLY-VIEWED (WITH MONOCHROME GRAPHICS, EVEN ON THE CAPABLE-OF-FAR-BETTER C64) AND FEATURES FULL OBJECT INTERACTION OF THE FILMATION STYLE - THIS IS TAKEN FURTHER HERE, AS THE PHYSICS OF THE OBJECTS ARE VARIED BY THEIR SHAPE AND CENTRE OF GRAVITY.

THERE ARE THREE STAGES TO COMPLETE. IN THE FIRST YOU PLAY JOHNATHAN HARKER, WHO MUST RETRIEVE SOME PAPERS (HE WORKS FOR AN ESTATE AGENT'S) AND ESCAPE THE CASTLE. THE SECOND LEVEL INTRODUCES JOHNATHAN'S WIFE LUCY, AND VAN HELSING, WITH PLAY SWITCHING BETWEEN THE THREE. LUCY'S ROLE IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AS IT IS SHE WHO PURSUES THE VAMPIRE ITSELF, AND SHE TAKES ON THE TASK ALONE IN LEVEL 3.

FOOD MUST BE COLLECTED TO KEEP THE CHARACTERS' STRENGTH UP, AND CRUCIFIXES AND CANDLES CAN BE PICKED UP TO HELP MATTERS.</desc>

		<name>Operation Thunderbolt</name>
		<desc>OPERATION THUNDERBOLT IS THE EXCITING SEQUEL TO OPERATION WOLF. AN AIRLINER IS HIJACKED BY TERRORISTS EN-ROUTE FROM PARIS TO BOSTON, WHO THREATEN TO KILL ALL HOSTAGES ON BOARD IF THEIR MATES AREN'T RELEASED FROM JAIL. INSTEAD OF REACHING ITS DESTINATION, THE AIRLINER MAKES A LANDING IN KALUBYA, AFRICA, AND ALL THE HOSTAGES ARE HIDDEN IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS. THE AUTHORITIES HAVE ASKED THE HERO FROM OPERATION WOLF TO RESCUE THE HOSTAGES, BUT ONLY THIS TIME, THE HERO BRINGS HIS FRIEND ALONG FOR THE RIDE.

THERE ARE EIGHT MISSIONS TO COMPLETE IN OPERATION THUNDERBOLT, AND EACH ONE HAS YOU SHOOTING DOWN SOLDIERS, CHOPPERS, AND TANKS. THE GAMEPLAY VARIES EVERY ONE OR TWO MISSIONS. IN SOME MISSIONS, YOU ARE DRIVING A JEEP OR CONTROLLING A BOAT, WHILE IN OTHERS, YOU ARE WALKING WHILE YOU'RE SHOOTING. YOU HAVE A LIMITED SUPPLY OF AMMO, AND A LIMITED SUPPLY OF ROCKET BOMBS, BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS STOCK UP BY SHOOTING DOWN CRATES FALLING FROM THE SKY, OR BY KILLING A CAT OR DOG THAT GET IN THE LINE OF FIRE. ALSO FROM CRATES, YOU CAN GET SPECIAL ITEMS LIKE BULLETPROOF VESTS, ROCKET BOMBS, AND DIFFERENT WEAPONS.

YOU ALSO HAVE A LIFE BAR TO WORRY ABOUT. IF YOU'RE SHOT AT BY SOLDIERS, OR IF ROCKET BOMBS OR GRENADES ARE THROWN AT YOU, YOU 'LL LOSE ENERGY, AND ONCE YOU'RE ENERGY IS DEPLETED,  YOU LOSE ONE OF YOUR THREE LIVES. YOU CAN LOSE A LOT OF ENERGY BY KILLING HOSTAGES ON PURPOSE,  AND YOU CAN'T EASILY AVOID KILLING THEM IF YOU DECIDE TO USE ROCKET BOMBS TO WIPE OUT ENEMIES. THE EIGHTH MISSION, THE MISSION THAT INVOLVES YOU FIGHTING TERRORISTS ON A PLANE,  PROVES TO BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE A WOMAN IN A BLUE DRESS STANDS UP AND GETS IN THE LINE OF FIRE, AND YOU HAVE TO VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO USE ROCKET BOMBS.

THERE ARE TWO ENDINGS TO THIS GAME, AND WHICH ENDING YOU CAN WATCH WILL DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF HOSTAGES YOU'VE SAVED, AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU SHOT THE PILOT INSTEAD OF THE MISSION EIGHT BOSS.</desc>

OPERATION WOLF IS AN ARCADE CONVERSION OF THE GAME BY TAITO. IT IS ESSENTIALLY A BITMAPPED "RAIL-SHOOTER", WHERE YOU BASICALLY HOLD THE GUN AND SHOOT JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT MOVES, WHILE CONSERVING YOUR AMMO AND GRENADES. SHOOT AMMO/GRENADES AND HEALING ITEMS ON THE SCREEN TO "PICK THEM UP". YOUR PRIMARY MACHINE GUN CAN KILL EVERYTHING IF YOU HIT IT ENOUGH TIMES, BUT YOU CAN ALSO USE THE GRENADE LAUNCHER FOR REALLY DEADLY TARGETS LIKE HELICOPTERS OR ARMORED CARS. YOU CAN COLLECT A MACHINE GUN WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO SHOOT FASTER FOR A FEW SECONDS. 

YOU'LL BE PUMMELLED BY A LOT OF ENEMIES. SOME WILL BE SHOOTING, OTHERS WILL BE TOSSING GRENADES, KNIFES, AND MORE. SOME ARE ARMORED AND REQUIRES MORE THAN A FEW HITS, OTHERS DODGES. YOU CAN SHOOT GRENADES AND KNIFES OUT OF THE AIR IF YOU AIM WELL ENOUGH. THERE ARE ALSO CIVILIANS RUNNING AROUND WHICH CAN BE SHOT, BUT IT'S NOT BENEFICIAL. 

BOSSES APPEAR AT THE END OF SOME LEVELS, AND EACH HAS A SPECIFIC WEAKNESS YOU NEED TO EXPLOIT.</desc>

		<desc>PHEENIX IS A CLASSIC SHOOTER, SIMILAR TO SPACE INVADERS: IN FIVE DIFFERENT SCREENS, YOU HAVE TO SHOOT BIRDS WHOSE DROPPINGS PROVE HARMFUL FOR YOUR SPACESHIP. LUCKILY, YOU CAN ACTIVATE A SHIELD THAT WILL PROTECT YOUR VESSEL FOR A SHORT TIME (YOU CAN'T SHOOT DURING THAT TIME EITHER THOUGH).

WHILE THE FIVE DIFFERENT SCREENS ARE SIMILAR, EACH ONE IS UNIQUE IN ITS WAY: IN THE THIRD SCREEN, YOU FIRST SEE EGGS FLYING AROUND BEFORE THE BIRDS HATCH AND START UNLOADING ON YOU. AND IN THE FIFTH SCREEN, YOU HAVE TO DESTROY THE ENEMY MOTHERSHIP.</desc>

		<name>Pippo</name>
		<desc>THIS SINGLE-SCREEN TOP-DOWN ACTION PUZZLER STARS PIPPO, A CUTE CREATURE WHO MUST CHANGE THE COLOUR OF EACH SQUARE ON A SCREEN. THERE ARE 32 LEVELS  THE CONCEPT IS THAT THE NUMBER OF TIMES A SQUARE MUST BE STEPPED ON TO CHANGE IT TO THE RIGHT COLOUR STARTS AT ONE AND INCREASES EVERY FOUR LEVELS, BUT THERES A BUG IN THE GAME MEANING THAT ODD-NUMBERED LEVELS ALWAYS NEED ONE CHANGE, AND EVEN-NUMBERED LEVELS ALWAYS NEED TWO. THE LEVELS ARE ON 6X4 GRIDS, ALTHOUGH THESE INCLUDE LOTS OF HOLES, WHICH PIPPO MUST AVOID. 

THERE ARE ALSO MANY NASTIES PATROLLING THE AREA  SOME KILL HIM, WHILE OTHERS RESET ANY PREVIOUS COLOUR CHANGES BUT CAN BE KILLED ON CONTACT (THE BOBBY YAZZ SHOW HAS A SIMILAR DESIGN ON THIS ELEMENT). PACMAN-STYLE POWER PILLS TEMPORARILY CHANGE ENEMIES INTO HARMLESS SPRINGS. THE GAME FEATURES A LOT OF TECHNICAL EFFECTS AND HARDWARE TRICKS, INCLUDING FULL-SCREEN NUMBERS USING THE NORMALLY-BLANK BORDER.</desc>

		<name>Platoon</name>
		<desc>THE FILM PLATOON FEATURED A SQUAD OF FIVE SOLDIERS ON THEIR MISSION FOR THE US ARMY IN VIETNAM. IN THIS ACTION GAME BASED AROUND THE FILM, YOU TAKE CONTROL OF THESE FIVE GUYS IN TURN, WITH THE CHANCE TO SWITCH BETWEEN THEM AS THEY EACH TAKE ONE OF THE 3 HITS THAT WOULD KILL THEM.

THE GAME RECREATES EACH OF THE SECTIONS OF THE FILM, STARTING WITH A SIDE-SCROLLING JOURNEY THROUGH THE JUNGLE, WITH PATHS TO CROSS BOTH HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY, AND THE ABILITY TO JUMP OR DUCK HAZARDS. YOU WILL NEED TO BLOW UP A BRIDGE AND THEN LOCATE A VILLAGE, WHICH CONTAINS A TORCH, A MAP AND A TRAP-DOOR. THE ENEMY HAS BOOBY-TRAPPED THE AREA AND ARE LAUNCHING AIRSTRIKES, SO THE DANGER IS NOT ALL FROM ENEMY GROUND SOLDIERS.

THE NEXT SECTION IS IN FIRST-PERSON 3D, AS YOU MOVE THROUGH A NETWORK OF TUNNELS IN SEARCH OF FLARES AND A COMPASS. THERE ARE 3 DISTINCT CONTROL METHODS, CHANGING FROM THE STANDARD MOTION WHEN AN ENEMY APPEARS (THIS PUTS YOU IN CONTROL OF A CROSS-HAIR FOR MORE ACCURATE TARGETING), AND WHEN YOU ENTER A ROOM TO SEARCH.

AFTER ESCAPING THIS YOU SETTLE IN A BUNKER OVERNIGHT, AND HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF FLARES WITH WHICH TO LOCATE INCOMING ENEMY, AND MUST THEN SHOOT THEM BEFORE THEY CAN SHOOT YOU. THE JUNGLE AIRSTRIKE FROM THE FILM IS THE NEXT MOMENT - YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES TO RUSH INTO A SAFE POSITION TO THE NORTH, USING YOUR COMPASS FOR GUIDANCE.

FINALLY YOU FACE THE TREACHEROUS SERGEANT BARNES, AND MUST HIT HIM WITH GRENADES 5 TIMES WHILST TRAPPED IN A FOXHOLE TO PREVENT HIM WIPING YOU OUT.</desc>

POPEYE HAS FOUR DIFFERENT LEVELS TO TRAVERSE THROUGH. HIS INITIAL ADVENTURE TAKES HIM TO A CONSTRUCTION SITE WHERE BOUNCING SPRINGS, FALLING GIRDERS AND OPEN WELDING FLAMES IMPEDE HIS PROGRESS. ROLLING BARRELS, AND BOMBS WHICH MUST BE TOUCHED TO BE PUT OUT ALSO STAND TO CAUSE HARM. IN EVERY LEVEL SCATTERED HAMBURGERS MUST BE COLLECTED IN ORDER FOR POPEYE TO GET PAST WIMPY WHO IS OFTEN HANGING OUT SOMEWHERE NEAR THE TOP OF EVERY VERTICALLY SCROLLING PLATFORM LEVEL. THERE ARE ALSO FEATS OF STRENGTH THAT POPEYE MUST PERFORM BY BEATING UP A PUNCHING ROBOT-TYPE THING WITH THE AID OF SPINACH. ONCE PAST ALL THESE OBSTACLES POPEYE CAN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

THE SECOND LEVEL TAKES POPEYE INTO THE URBAN JUNGLE WHERE HE MUST CLIMB THE SIDE OF THE BIFF SPINACH BUILDING AND AVOID THE SAME OBSTACLES AS IN THE PREVIOUS LEVELS. IN THE THIRD LEVEL FALLING GIRDERS ARE REPLACED WITH GIANT BANANAS AS POPEYE FINDS HIMSELF IN A JUNGLE. COCONUT THROWING MONKEYS HANG FROM LEDGES AND SNOOZING TIGERS AND SNAKES DECORATE THE TREES. THE FOURTH AND FINAL LEVEL OF THE GAME FINDS POPEYE CLIMBING THE MASTS OF THE S.S. TREV AND THE S.S. ANDY AS HE MAKES HIS WAY TO A FINAL CONFRONTATION WITH BLUTO AND RESCUE OLIVE OYL.

POPEYE IS ABLE TO JUMP AROUND AND OCCASIONALLY WHEN THE SITUATION CALLS FOR IT PUNCH HIS WAY THROUGH THIS VERTICAL PLATFORMER. BONUS POINTS ARE REWARDED FOR FINDING SWEE'PEA AND JEEP. HE CAN TAKE MULTIPLE HITS BEFORE HE TAKES A CURTAIN CALL BUT THANKFULLY IS UNHARMED BY LONG DROPS. THE PLAYER SHOULD BEWARE AS POPEYE HAS ONLY ONE LIFE TO GET THROUGH THE FOUR LEVELS OF THIS ADVENTURE.</desc>

		<name>Puzznic</name>
		<desc>THE CHALLENGE IN EACH LEVEL OF PUZZNIC IS TO MANEUVRE A SELECTION OF BLOCKS INTO PLACE SO AS TO CLEAR THEM ALL, BY MAKING THEM MAKE CONTACT WITH BLOCKS OF THE SAME DESIGN. YOU CONTROL A CROSS-HAIR, WHICH CAN MOVE A BLOCK LEFT OR RIGHT, WHICH CAN CAUSE IT TO FALL IF THERE IS NO BLOCK UNDER THE SPACE IT WOULD OCCUPY.

THERE ARE MANY COMPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF SOLVING THE LEVELS. MOVING PLATFORMS MEANING THAT YOU NEED TO MOVE A BLOCK AT A PARTICULAR TIME, OR IN PARTICULAR ORDER, TO PREVENT THEM BEING BLOCKADED. IN SOME SITUATIONS THERE ARE AN ODD NUMBER OF A CERTAIN TYPE OF BLOCK - SOLVING THESE REQUIRES POSITIONING TWO OF THE BLOCKS ONE SPACE APART, SUCH THAT A MOVE WILL RESULT IN A PIECE MAKING CONTACT WITH 2 OTHERS, AND IMMEDIATELY REMOVING ALL 3. YOU WILL ALSO ENCOUNTER BLOCKS POSITIONED ON PLATFORMS SUSPENDED IN SPACE AND GAPS IN LEVEL ARRANGEMENTS MEANING THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BLOCKS MUST BE IN PLACE TO MAKE A CERTAIN MOVE POSSIBLE (BY FORMING A STACK, FOR EXAMPLE)

THE GAME STRUCTURE IS SLIGHTLY UNUSUAL, AS AFTER YOU COMPLETE EACH BATCH OF FOUR LEVELS YOU GET A CHOICE OF 2 SETS OF LEVELS - YOU ARE PROGRESSING THROUGH AN EXPANDING MATRIX OF LEVELS, WHICH MEANS THERE ARE 2 SETS ON LEVEL 2, 3 ON LEVEL 3, 4 ON LEVEL 4, AND SO ON. THIS MEANS THAT THERE ARE A TOTAL OF 220 SCREENS IN THE GAME. EACH SCREEN IS PLAYED AGAINST A TIME LIMIT, AND LOSING A LEVEL (EITHER BY RUNNING OUT OF TIME, OR BY MAKING A POOR MOVE AND LEAVING AN IMPOSSIBLE POSITION) LOSES ONE OF YOUR 3 LIVES.</desc>

KNOWLEDGE OF PARADROID IS AN ADVANTAGE (NOT LEAST BECAUSE IT'S A SPLENDID GAME), AS MOST ASPECTS OF THE GAME OVERLAP, INCLUDING THE PLOT, WHICH SETS YOU AS THE RENEGADE ROBOT KLP-2, ARMED WITH EXPERIMENTAL TECHNOLOGY TO ATTACK ENEMY DROIDS. 

YOUR TASK IS TO DEACTIVATE ROBOTS, WHICH CAN BE DONE IN A NUMBER OF WAYS - SHOOTING THEM, GAINING CONTROL OF THEM SO AS TO DEACTIVATE THEM (KNOWN AS 'GRAPPLING') OR PUSHING THEM OFF THEIR CIRCUITS. KNOWING WHICH METHOD TO USE IN EACH SITUATION CAN ONLY COME FROM PRACTICE. GRAPPLING IS DONE FROM A SEPARATE SCREEN, AND INVOLVES AIMING AT THE ENEMY DROID'S 12 SECTORS SO AS TO TURN AT LEAST 7 OF THEM TO YOUR COLOUR. WHEN THIS IS DONE SUCCESSFULLY YOU CAN HARVEST SOME OF THE DROID'S COMPONENTS FOR YOUR OWN USE - A CLEAR GRAPPLING VICTORY GIVES YOU MORE CHANCE OF THESE ELEMENTS BEING UNDAMAGED AND USABLE.</desc>

		<desc>THE PURPOSE OF APPRENTICE COURSES IS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO LEARN A TRADE GRADUALLY, WITHOUT PUTTING YOURSELF OR YOUR EMPLOYERS AT RISK. UNFORTUNATELY, NOBODY EXPLAINED THIS TO WIZARDS APPRENTICE MERVYN, BEFORE HE TRIED TO CAST A SPELL TO MAKE HIM IRRESISTIBLE TO FEMALES, AS THE SPELL MISFIRED, AND MADE HIM ATTRACTIVE ONLY TO FEMALE FROGS. HOWEVER, HIS DUNGEON WAS SOON INVADED, AND MERVYN WAS NOT KILLED, AS HE APPEARED TO BE A HUMBLE FROG.

VIEWED FROM ABOVE, THE AIM IS TO KILL ALL 96 OF THE WIZARDS WHO HAVE INVADED THE DUNGEON, WHICH IS SPLIT INTO 8 LEVELS, EACH MADE UP OF 16 SCREENS AND AT LEAST 50 ROOMS. TO SEE WHATS IN A ROOM HE HAS TO ENTER IT, IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THE SWITCHBLADE GAMES.

THE GAMES RATHER ESOTERIC TITLE COMES FROM THE WAY YOU OBTAIN SPELLS TO UPGRADE THE FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF POWER YOU HAVE (POWER, OFFENCE, DEFENCE AND EFFECT). WHEN YOU MEET A WARLOCK YOU ENTER A MINI GAME IN WHICH THE LETTERS RANARAMA ARE IN RANDOM ORDER, AND BY SWAPPING PAIRS OF LETTERS IN SEQUENCE YOU MUST FORM THE FULL WORD IN AS LITTLE TIME AS POSSIBLE. THIS SYSTEM OF HAVING A SUB-GAME FOR COLLECTING UPGRADES IS SIMILAR TO THE GRAPPLING CONCEPT IN PARADROID.

THIS EARNS UP TO FOUR OF THE RUNES (MYSTICISM, WITCHCRAFT, MAGECRAFT AND RUNECRAFT), EACH OF WHICH CAN BE USED ON ONE OF THE FOUR TYPES OF POWER. THE MAGECRAFT OFFENSIVE USE IS A FIREBALL, DEFENCE FOR RUNECRAFT MAKES YOU INVISIBLE TO ENEMIES, AND THE SPECIAL EFFECT FOR WITCHCRAFT ALLOWS YOU TO JUMP THROUGH SPACE. LOSE A LIFE AND YOU LOSE ALL THESE POWERS, AND LOSING ANOTHER LIFE MEANS ITS GAME OVER.</desc>

YOU ARE CAPABLE OF ALL MANNER OF NINJA-STYLE MOVES INCLUDING KICKS AND PUNCHES, AS WELL AS USING WEAPONRY. YOU MUST TRAVEL THROUGH AN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX LINKED MAINLY BY PLATFORMS AND LADDERS, BEFORE TRIGGERING A BOMB AND ESCAPING THE COMPLEX. YOUR ENERGY RECHARGES IF YOU STAY STILL, SO FINDING AREAS FREE OF GUARDS (KILL THESE FOR MONEY) AND DOGS (AVOID THEM; KILLING THEM GAINS YOU NOTHING) IS USEFUL, ESPECIALLY AS YOU ONLY HAVE ONE LIFE. THERE'S PLENTY OF OBJECT MANIPULATION INVOLVED, ALTHOUGH ONLY ONE ITEM CAN EVER BE CARRIED AT A TIME.</desc>

THIS IS THE CASE WITH THIS ITALIAN YOUNGSTER SINGER OF OVERWHELMING PERSONALITY THAT ENTERS BY THE HAND OF IBER SOFT TO THE WORLD OF VIDEOGAMES.

THE GAME DEVELOPS THE EVENTFUL JOURNEYS THAT A POPULAR SINGER -SABRINA- MUST SUFFER TO BE ABLE TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE AIRPORT TO THE NEAREST TELEVISION STUDIOS. IN ORDER TO ARRIVE THERE, SHE MUST CROSS A TOWN WHOSE INHABITANTS SEEM TO BE A LITTLE DIS-CONFORMED WITH THEIR WAY TO BE, TO ACT AND, MAINLY, TO DRESS.

YOUR MISSION WILL BE TO GUIDE SABRINA IN THIS ARDUOUS WAY, AVOIDING OR ELIMINATING AS MORE AS POSSIBLE ENEMIES. THEY ARE OF SEVERAL KINDS, ALTHOUGH ALL OF THEM HAVE AN ASPECT IN COMMON: THEY ARE NORMAL AND CURRENT PEOPLE OF WHOM YOU CAN BE FOUND IN THE STREET TO DOZENS. THUS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE TYPICAL HOUSEWIVES, THE KNIFER, THE AGGRESSIVE PUNKIE, THE EXORCIST PRIEST, THE OLD WOMAN WITH HER INDISPENSABLE CANE AND A LONG LIST OF OTHERS OF CITIZEN TIPISMS.</desc>

YOU PLAY SAVAGE, A MUSCULAR WARRIOR WHO WAS IMPRISONED IN A CASTLE. WHEN HE BROKE FREE, HE FOUND OUT THAT HIS IMPRISONMENT HAD BEEN A TRICK WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE OF IMPRISONING HIS LOVE, THE MAIDEN. YOU HAVE TO PROGRESS THROUGH THE 3 PARTS OF THE GAME TO RESCUE HER. 

THE FIRST IS A SIMPLE HORIZONTAL-SCROLLING SHOOTER, IN WHICH YOU USE THE TRAJECTORY OF YOUR SHOTS TO KILL ENEMIES AND COLLECT THE TREASURES AND IMPROVED WEAPONS THEY DROP WHEN KILLED. THE SECOND IS A 1ST PERSON PERSPECTIVE 3D SHOOTER RESEMBLING SPACE HARRIER, WITH SKULLS TO SHOOT AND MONOLITHS TO AVOID. IN THE THIRD YOU PLAY SAVAGE'S EAGLE FORM, FLYING THROUGH PLATFORM-STYLE LEVELS AVOIDING TIMING-BASED HAZARDS AND SHOOTING ANYONE WHO GETS IN YOUR WAY.

THE GAME IS SPLIT INTO TWO PARTS, WHICH DIFFER FROM THE COMMODORE 64 GAME OF THE SAME NAME, AND CAN EACH BE PLAYED INDEPENDENTLY. THE FIRST IS VIEWED IN THIRD-PERSON 3D, AS OUR HERO MOVES FROM ROOM TO ROOM THROUGH VARIOUS DOORS. OBJECTS CAN BE PICKED UP TO ALLOW HIM TO JUMP AND FIRE. YOU CAN USE OBJECTS IN YOUR POSSESSION, TAKE THEM BY SEARCHING DESKS, OR LINK TO SOME OF THE AVAILABLE COMPUTERS TO USE THEIR FUNCTIONALITY.

IN THE SECOND STAGE, ARMED WITH JUMPING AND SHOOTING ABILITIES, NUMBER 5 MUST SIMPLY ESCAPE AS QUICKLY AS HE CAN. GUARDS AND OTHER ROBOTS ARE GIVING CHASE, AND SHOULD BE SHOT. YOUR ROBOT BECOMES INCREASINGLY DEPRESSED WHEN HE KILLS WILDLIFE, AND THIS CAN EVENTUALLY COST YOU A LIFE, SO MAKE SURE YOU JUMP OR DUCK AROUND THEM.</desc>

PLAYER 1 WOULD PLAY AS A HELICOPTER, BUT IF A SECOND PLAYER JOINED THE GAME, THEY WOULD PLAY AS A JEEP. BOTH PLAYERS WOULD HAVE TO PROTECT EACH OTHER AS WELL AS THEMSELVES. AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF KILLS, A "GOOSE" HELICOPTER WOULD FORM ON THE SCREEN. IF THE PLAYERS MANAGED TO DESTROY IT THEY WOULD GET A WEAPONS POWERUP. THIS WOULD GO ON THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE GAME (A "GOOSE" COULD APPEAR EVEN DURING THE END OF LEVEL BADDIE!).</desc>

THE FIRST TASK IS TO PLACE ESSENTIALS SUCH AS HOUSING, TRANSPORT LINKS, SCHOOLS, FACTORIES AND SHOPS. THERE ARE 50 TYPES OF THESE, ALLOWING FOR HOMES OF ALL STANDARDS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF BUSINESSES. MAKE SURE TO CONSIDER WHICH SITES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR WHICH TASKS. SOME POWER SOURCES POLLUTE, OTHERS DON'T BUT ARE MORE EXPENSIVE. TAXES MUST BE RAISED TO ENSURE AN INCOME, AND THEN PORTIONS ALLOCATED TO PUBLIC SERVICES SUCH AS POLICING AND ROADS. EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS AND FIRES ARE ALL EMERGENCY SITUATIONS THAT MUST BE DEALT TO CONTAIN ANY DAMAGE.

SUCCESSFUL MAYORING WILL CAUSE THE SMALL VILLAGE TO GROW INTO A TOWN, THEN A CITY AND FINALLY A METROPOLIS. AS THE CITY'S SIZE GROWS SO DO IT'S NEEDS. COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS MAY SUDDENLY FIND THAT THEY NEED AN AIRPORT TO EXPAND TRADE, OR HOUSING MAY FIND ITSELF CHANGING RAPIDLY AS VAST AMOUNTS OF PEOPLE COME AND LEAVE.

THE GAME ALSO INCLUDES 8 PRE-DEFINED TIME-LIMITED SCENARIOS, WITH SPECIFIC CHALLENGES AND TARGETS. THE ENVIRONMENT VARIES IN EACH GAME (ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE THE TERRAIN EDITOR ADD ON), AND THIS SHOULD AFFECT YOUR CHOICES.</desc>

		<desc>KRILLYS HAS STOLEN THE ZODIAC POWER SOURCE AND BROKEN IT INTO SIX PIECES, AND SARNAK HAS BEEN SENT TO FIND IT AND HOPEFULLY RESCUE HIS FRIENDS TERON, GORMAN AND TARTARUS. HE TRAVELS THROUGH THE EBBEDOWN FOREST INITIALLY, WITH GAMEPLAY SIMILAR TO GHOSTS AND GOBLINS. 

THE JOURNEY IS LARGELY FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, ALTHOUGH DOWNWARD MOVEMENTS THROUGH GAPS AND UPWARD MOVEMENTS ON ROTATING PLATFORMS ARE ALSO FREQUENT. SOME DROPS CAN BE FATAL, BUT MOSTLY THOSE WHICH HAVE A PLATFORM IN CLOSE REACH, SO THESE ARE AVOIDABLE AND NOT PURELY RANDOM. THERE ARE MANY MAGIC TELEPORTS EN ROUTE, AND THE HIGH TREES NARROW THE JOURNEY. EXTRA LIVES (VIA COLLECTING 8 CRYSTALS) AND IMPROVED WEAPONRY ARE ON OFFER THROUGHOUT YOUR QUEST.</desc>

		<desc>SOLOMON'S KEY IS A PLATFORM GAME WITH BOTH ACTION AND STRATEGY ELEMENTS. ON EACH LEVEL YOUR GOAL IS TO RETRIEVE A KEY WHICH CAN THEN BE USED TO UNLOCK THE EXIT. TO HELP OUT, YOU HAVE A MAGIC WAND WHICH CAN BE USED TO CREATE AND DESTROY BLOCKS (THOUGH SOME BLOCKS CAN'T BE DESTROYED). IN ORDER TO REACH THE KEY YOU WILL NEED CAREFULLY TO ARRANGE THE BLOCKS ON THE SCREEN SO YOU CAN JUMP YOUR WAY AROUND SAFELY. WANDERING AROUND EACH LEVEL ARE A VARIETY OF ENEMIES WHICH WILL CAUSE YOU TO LOSE A LIFE IF YOU'RE CAUGHT. SOME CREATURES CAN BE KILLED BY DESTROYING THE BLOCK THEY ARE STANDING ON, OTHERS MUST BE DODGED. HIDDEN BONUSES AND MAGIC CAN BE FOUND ON MANY OF THE LEVELS, SOMETIMES EVEN HIDDEN IN BLOCKS. SOME TREASURES GIVE YOU BONUS POINTS, OTHERS CAN FORM MAGIC SPELLS TO HELP DEAL WITH THE ENEMIES. TO MAKE THE GAME MORE DIFFICULT, EACH LEVEL HAS A TIME LIMIT IN WHICH IT MUST BE COMPLETED.</desc>

JESSE HAS VOWED TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF HIS BEST FRIEND, AND GOES ON A MISSION TO TAKE DOWN THE VILLAINS WHETHER THEY MAY BE. BUT JESSE NEED NOT LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THE STREET. THE BADDIES ARE DRIVING XR3'S, SO ALL IT WOULD TAKE IS ONE LASER BLAST IN THE XR3 FUEL TANK, AND THE CARS ARE IMMOBILIZED.

ZOOMING ALONG, THE PLAYER HAS TO SERVE THROUGH TRAFFIC, DODGING THE BULLETS FIRED BY THE BAD GUYS AND ELIMINATING CARLOADS OF CRIMINALS WHILE TAKING CARE NOT TO KILL INNOCENT CITIZENS. AS WELL AS THE BUILT-IN LASERS, JESSE'S BIKE CAN LEAP INTO THE AIR, AND A WELL-TIMED SPRING CAN AVOID A COLLISION. A CRASH OR A BLAST FROM A VILLAIN'S GUN IS NOT FATAL, AS THE BIKE CAN TAKE A FAIR BIT OF DAMAGE BEFORE IT IS IMMOBILIZED. RECKLESS DRIVING IS NOT TOLERATED, AND IF TOO MANY CIVILIANS ARE KILLED, THE POLICE WILL BE IN PURSUIT. IF THE POLICE CATCHES UP WITH THE BIKE, THE GAME ENDS. HOWEVER, THE TURBO FACILITY CAN BE USED TO MAKE A QUICK GETAWAY.

AFTER DRIVING ALONG, THE PLAYER NEEDS TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE GAUGES THAT INDICATE THE CONDITION OF THE LASERS, THE DAMAGE INFLICTED ON THE BIKE, AND THE ENGINE TEMPERATURE. POINTS ARE AWARDED FOR EACH OF THE VILLAIN'S CAR BLOWN UP AND FOR EACH CIVILIAN OVERTAKEN. WHILE DRIVING, JESSE RECEIVES A MESSAGE REGARDING A BREAK-IN AT THE LIQUOR STORE. IT IS UP TO HIM TO TAKE IT SLOWLY SO THAT HE CAN ARRIVE THERE SAFELY.

AT THE LIQUOR STORE, YOU MUST DESTROY THREE VILLAINS WHO RUN OUT OF THE STORE AND ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE IN THEIR GETAWAY VAN. ALL OF THE VILLAINS MUST BE SHOT BEFORE THE SECOND MISSION CAN BEGIN. THIS MISSION INVOLVES ANOTHER CHASE SEQUENCE, ONLY THIS TIME A HIGH BONUS IS AWARDED FOR KILLING OFF A MAJOR UNDERWORLD FIGURE WHO IS DRIVING A BLACK SEDAN. ONCE THE SEDAN GETS DESTROYED, JESSE AND HIS BIKE CAN RETURN TO BASE FOR A REFIT SO THE MAJOR CONFRONTATION WITH THE LEADER CAN BEGIN. TO COMPLETE THE GAME, THE LEADER MUST BE BLOWN OUT OF HIS PORSCHE.</desc>

		<desc>THE ENEMY HAS KIDNAPPED THE WORLD'S TOP COMPUTER SCIENTISTS, AND IS INTENT ON CRACKING INTO YOUR SUPERCOMPUTER. STRIKE FORCE COBRA MUST PENETRATE HIS HIDEOUT, CRACK HIS COMPUTER CODES, AND RESCUE THE SCIENTISTS BEFORE ANY OF THIS CAN BE DONE. TO CRACK THE CODE YOU USE A DLB (DIGITAL LOCK BREAKER) WHICH IS MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN MORE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN FOUND, AND THE SCIENTISTS GIVE THESE WHEN RESCUED.

YOUR TEAM OF FOUR MEMBERS OF VARYING NATIONALITIES IS CHOSEN FROM A POOL OF 8, EACH WITH THEIR OWN STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. THE GAME IS VIEWED ISOMETRICALLY, AND YOU MOVE THE CHARACTERS (ONE AT A TIME) THROUGH THE LAIR, SHOOTING DOWN INTRUDERS AND CLEARING ANY TRAPS FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS TO GO THROUGH.</desc>

		<name>Super Hang-On</name>
		<desc>THIS IS A CONVERSION OF SEGA'S POPULAR MOTORCYCLE RACING ARCADE GAME.  IN THIS GAME YOU RACE A MOTORCYCLE AROUND THE WORLD, COMPLETING EACH SECTION OF TRACK WITHIN A TIME LIMIT. THERE ARE OTHER BIKES ON THE ROAD, BUT BEATING THIS IS NOT IMPORTANT, SO THEY CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS MOVING OBSTACLES. EACH CONTINENT IS A DIFFERENT DIFFICULTY LEVEL: AFRICA IS BEGINNER, ASIA IS JUNIOR, THE AMERICAS ARE SENIOR, AND EUROPE IS EXPERT.  

THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD GAME, VIEWED FROM BEHIND THE BIKE IN 2D (SO THE SCREEN DOES NOT TILT WITH THE BIKE). THE RIGHT/LEFT CONTROLS ARE STEERING, AND UP/DOWN ARE GEAR CHANGES. YOUR CYCLE IS ALWAYS MOVING, AND YOUR SPEED STRICTLY DEPENDS ON THE GEAR YOU ARE IN, ALTHOUGH CONTACT OR RUNNING OFF THE ROAD SLOWS THE BIKE DOWN.</desc>

		<name>Superstar Indoor Sports</name>
		<desc>FOUR INDOOR SPORTS ARE COMPILED IN THIS ENTRY TO DESIGNSTAR'S SPORTTIME LINE OF RECREATIONS. TEN-PIN BOWLING, AIR HOCKEY, DARTS AND (EXCEPT ON THE COMMODORE 64) PING PONG ARE FEATURED. THE MENUS AND OPTIONS SCREENS HAVE THE SAME FEEL AS CLUBHOUSE SPORTS. EACH GAME HAS COMPUTER OPPONENTS AT MULTIPLE SKILL LEVELS PLUS HUMAN-VERSUS-HUMAN AND DEMO MODES, AND MATCHES CAN CONSIST OF VARYING NUMBERS OF ROUNDS, WITH OTHER OPTIONS DEPENDING ON THE GAME.

TEN-PIN BOWLING IS PLAYED FROM A SIDE-ON VIEW, ALTHOUGH ONCE THE SHOT HAS BEEN TAKEN YOU SEE THE RESULTS UNFOLD FROM THE BOWLER'S VIEW. THERE ARE THREE STAGES TO TAKING A SHOT. MOVE THE PLAYER UP AND DOWN TO LINE UP HIS RUN-UP, PRESSING FIRE TO SET THE POSITION. THEN, DO THE SAME TO SET THE ANGLE OF THE SHOT. FINALLY, AFTER PRESSING FIRE TO START THE RUN-UP, PRESS IT AGAIN TO TIME THE RELEASE OF THE BALL, AS CLOSE TO THE LINE AS POSSIBLE.

DARTS HAS 4 SKILL AND 3 SPEED LEVELS, AND PLAYERS CAN PLAY TO 301, 501 OR 701, TO VARY GAME LENGTH OR PROVIDE A HANDICAPPING SYSTEM. YOU CAN ALSO SET WHETHER SCORING MUST START OR END WITH A DOUBLE. VIEWED FROM BEHIND THE BOARD, YOU MUST FIRST LINE UP THE DART, THEN SET THE DART'S CURVATURE AND POWER BY STOPPING A CURVED GAUGE ON THE RIGHT, THEN A RISING POWER BAR ON THE LEFT. THE VIEW THEN CHANGES TWICE - FIRST A BEHIND-THE-PLAYER VIEW TO SHOW THE DART'S APPROACH, THEN A CLOSE-UP OF THE BOARD TO SHOW WHERE IT LANDED.

AIR HOCKEY PLAYS FOR FIVE MINUTES, OR UNTIL SOMEONE HAS SCORED 12 POINTS. THE VIEW IS ABOVE THE PITCH BUT ANGLED SO AS TO EMPHASIZE THE GOAL AT THE TOP.

PING-PONG FEATURES A HANDICAPPING SYSTEM - SIX ABILITY AREAS CAN BE GRADED FROM 1-5, TO ENSURE A CLOSELY-MATCHED GAME. AGAIN THE VIEW IS FROM BEHIND ONE COURT. TO IMPART DIRECTION ONTO A SHOT, THE ANGLE MUST BE PRESSED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE FIRE BUTTON.</desc>

		<desc>THE GREAT ESCAPE IS AN ISOMETRIC ACTION-ADVENTURE GAME.

GATHER ROUND, KIDS, AND LISTEN TO GRANDPA TELL OF HIS TIME AS A PRISONER OF WAR IN GERMANY. TWAS BACK IN 1942. THOSE WERE ROUGH TIMES, LADS. ROUGH TIMES. BEEN SHOT DOWN IN MY PLANE. DARN SHAME IT WAS, IT BEING A GOOD PLANE AND ALL. NEXT I KNOW, THERES THIS GROUP OF GERMAN SOLDIERS STANDING ROUND ME, AND OFF WE GO TO A P.O.W. CAMP. BIG THING, THAT, PLENTY OF GUARDS ALL AROUND WITH A KEEN EYE ON YOUR EVERY MOVE, AND FULL OF UNFORTUNATE SOULS LIKE MYSELF. JUST THAT THEY DO NAUGHT BUT SIT ALL DAY AND SOB AND GENERALLY BE NO GREAT HELP WHEN IT COMES TO DOING THE GREAT ESCAPE. BUT NOT ME, NO SIR! I SHOWED THEM GERMANS, I DID, AND I WAS OUT OF THEIR FASHIONABLE HIGH SECURITY HE WHO COMES HERE, STAYS HERE CAMP IN NO TIME. YOU WANNA HEAR THAT STORY? BET YOU DO!

CONTROLLING A PRISONER OF WAR IN A GERMAN CAMP, YOUR GOAL IS TO BREAK OUT UNDETECTED. THERE ARE NUMEROUS WAYS TO FREEDOM  BACK DOORS, CRACKED FENCES, EVEN UNDERGROUND TUNNELS. HOWEVER, YOU HAVE TO PLAN YOUR ESCAPE WHILE OBEYING THE STRICT RULES OF THE CAMP. 

NUMBER ONE: DAILY PROGRAM. YOU HAVE TO ATTEND TWO ROLL CALLS A DAY, ONE MEAL, ONE EXERCISE, AND STAY IN BED AT NIGHT. FAILURE TO APPEAR AT ANY OF THESE EVENTS WILL RESULT IN THE ALARM BEING RUNG. WHEN YOU DO NOT TOUCH THE CONTROLS, YOUR PROTAGONIST WILL MOVE AUTOMATICALLY, GOING TO ALL IMPORTANT EVENTS. YOU HAVE TO DETECT AND USE GAPS IN THE TIME-TABLE TO EXPLORE THE CAMP. 

RULE NUMBER TWO: GUARD ROOMS ARE OFF LIMITS. IF A SOLDIER CATCHES YOU IN A ROOM THAT IS FORBIDDEN, YOU WILL BE PLACED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. OF COURSE, YOU HAVE TO ENTER RESTRICTED PARTS OF THE CAMP TO FIND ITEMS CRUCIAL FOR YOUR ESCAPE. THE MORAL FLAG WILL TURN FROM GREEN TO RED TO INDICATE THAT YOU ARE IN AN AREA WHERE YOU SHOULDNT BE. 

RULE NO THREE: NO PRISONER MAY CARRY FORBIDDEN OBJECTS. WHEN YOU ARE CAUGHT IN A SUSPICIOUS SITUATION, YOU WILL BE STRIPPED OF ALL ITEMS THAT YOU FOUND SO FAR. TO AVOID THAT, YOU HAVE TO DEPOSIT OBJECTS IN A SAFE PLACE. YOU NEED TO FIND KEYS TO OPEN LOCKED DOORS, UNIFORMS FOR CAMOUFLAGE, FLASHLIGHTS TO SEE IN DARK TUNNELS, AND MANY MORE. 

RULE NUMBER FOUR: GUARD COMMANDS ARE TO BE OBEYED AT ALL TIMES. THE GERMAN SOLDIERS PATROL ON FIXED ROUTES AND HAVE A LINE OF SIGHT. YOU HAVE TO LEARN THE GUARDS ROUTES AND SNEAK PAST THEIR BACKS TO AVOID DETECTION WHEN BREAKING OUT. IF YOU ARE CAUGHT, YOUR MORALE WILL DECREASE. IF YOUR MORALE REACHES ZERO, YOUR WILL TO ESCAPE IS BROKEN.</desc>

YOU CONTROL A BAT, WHICH MUST 'SERVE' THE BALL INTO PLAY, AND THEN FOLLOW IT THROUGH THE LEVEL, DEFLECTING IT BEFORE IT FALLS BEHIND YOU, AS THIS COSTS YOU ONE OF YOUR 4 LIVES. INITIALLY THE OBSTACLES ARE ALL STATIC, BUT MOVING BARRIERS ADD TIMING, REACTIONS AND LUCK TO PROCEEDINGS.

THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL BONUS OBJECTS, WHICH ARE COLLECTED BY PASSING THROUGH THEM. THESE INCLUDE AN L FOR AN EXTRA BALL AND DUAL RECTANGLES TO GIVE YOU A SECOND BAT WHICH MOVES AROUND AT RANDOM.

THE GAME ALSO COMES WITH A FULL LEVEL EDITOR, ALLOWING YOU TO DESIGN NEW LEVELS AND SAVE THEM TO TAPE OR DISK.</desc>

		<desc>THIS PLACE WOULD INDEED BE PARADISE, WERE IT NOT FOR THE FACT THAT THE CAN NIBBLES INHABIT IT. HERBERT AND WILMA WEEK ARE TRAPPED BY THEM, SO WALLY HAS BECOME THE THIRD WEEK IN PARADISE IN HIS ATTEMPT AT RESCUING THEM.

THIS IS AN ARCADE ADVENTURE RESEMBLING THE OTHER WALLY WEEK GAMES, ALTHOUGH IT REPRESENTS DAVID PERRY'S DESIGN DEBUT. THERE ARE MANY ANIMALS TO AVOID INCLUDING STINGING BEES AND BUTTERFLIES, BUT THE TOUGHEST FOE IS THE INDIAN CHIEF, BEST AVOIDED WITH A WELL-TIMED JUMP. THERE ARE MULTI-STAGE PUZZLES TO SOLVE ON EACH SCREEN, AND A LIMIT OF CARRYING 2 OBJECTS AT A TIME.

THE SETTING IS LARGELY JUNGLE, BUT THERE ARE FORESTS, BEACHES AND HUTS AMONGST OTHER THINGS TO EXPLORE AS WELL. MOVEMENT BETWEEN SCREENS IS GENERALLY FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, BUT YOU WILL GO INTO THE SCREEN VIA SIGNPOSTED SECTIONS, AND OCCASIONALLY TRAVEL VERTICALLY AS WELL.</desc>

		<name>Thrust II</name>
		<desc>THE PHYSICS-BASED GAMEPLAY OF THE ORIGINAL THRUST IS BACK AND THE CONTROLS OF YOUR CRAFT ARE BASICALLY THE SAME - SWIVEL LEFT AND RIGHT, AND THRUST. WHILE THE ESSENCE OF THE GAME REMAINS VERY SIMILAR THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES SECOND TIME ROUND. 

THE FEDERAL RESISTANCE HAS CAPTURED AN ARTIFICIAL PLANET OF GREAT STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE IN THE WAR AGAINST THE GALACTIC EMPIRE. HOWEVER, THE PURIFICATION OF THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE IS NOT YET COMPLETE.

YOU MUST SEARCH THE PLANET FOR 16 ORBS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH LIE BELOW THE SURFACE, THESE ARE REQUIRED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSOR. THIS WILL INVOLVE DESCENDING INTO THE MAZE-LIKE TUNNELS OF THE PLANET, AVOIDING (OR DESTROYING) A VARIETY OF ANDROIDS IN YOUR PATH AND RETURNING TO THE SURFACE WITH THE ORBS IN TOW. 

ONLY ONE ORB CAN BE PICKED UP AT A TIME AND THEY MUST BE PUT IN PLACE AT A DESIGNATED SITE ON THE SURFACE. ONCE AN ORB IS PICKED UP A TIMER BEGINS COUNTING DOWN; IF IT'S NOT IN PLACE IN TIME THE ENTIRE PLANET IS DESTROYED! IF YOUR CRAFT (OR AN ORB THAT HAS BEEN PICKED UP) COLLIDES WITH THE WALLS OR THE ANDROIDS THAT PATROL THE PASSAGEWAYS THEN IT IS INSTANTLY DESTROYED, A SHIELD (LIFE) IS LOST AND PLAY IS RESUMED FROM A NEARBY LOCATION. WEAPON PICKUPS DESTROY ALL ENEMIES ON THE SCREEN OF A SPECIFIC TYPE BUT CAN ONLY BE USED FOR A LIMITED TIME. 

INSTEAD OF THE INDIVIDUAL LEVELS IN THE ORIGINAL GAME, THERE IS ONLY ONE GAME WORLD IN THRUST II AND THE ORBS ARE SCATTERED ABOUT IN DIFFERENT PLACES; THEY ARE ALSO OF VARYING MASSES AND AFFECT THE HANDLING OF YOUR CRAFT DIFFERENTLY.</desc>

THE ACTION IS VIEWED FROM THE SIDE, WITH THE GRAPHICS DRAWN IN VECTORS, IN KEEPING WITH THE MATHEMATICAL NATURE OF EVERYTHING THAT UNFOLDS.

AS A RESISTANCE FIGHTER, THE PLAYER MUST FLY INTO ENEMY LINES IN ORDER TO STEAL KLYSTRON PODS TO POWER MORE ADVANCED STARSHIPS, USING YOUR TRACTOR BEAM TO TAKE THEM. A NETWORK OF MOUNTED GUNS ARE AIMING TO SHOOT THE PLAYER DOWN  THESE CAN BE DISABLED BY SHOOTING THEIR POWER SOURCE, BUT EVENTUALLY THIS WILL EXPLODE, FORCING THE PLAYER TO FLEE. SOME OF THE LATER LEVELS FEATURE REVERSE GRAVITY, WHICH IS WHERE THINGS REALLY GET DIFFICULT.</desc>

		<desc>THE FIRST OF A TRILOGY OF SIMILARLY-DESIGNED TITLES FROM GARGOYLE GAMES, TIR NA NOG IS A COMPLEX MIX OF ARCADE AND ADVENTURE ELEMENTS DONE IN AN INNOVATIVE WAY. THE GAME IS VIEWED FROM THE SIDE, AND TO CHANGE DIRECTION YOU MUST ROTATE THE VIEW.

YOU PLAY CUCHULAINN, AND YOU MUST RESTORE THE SIDHE RACE TO ITS FORMER POSITION OF INTELLIGENCE, ENLIGHTENMENT AND CIVILIZATION. THIS CAN BE DONE BY RETRIEVING THE FOUR PIECES OF THE SEAL OF CALUM, WHICH WAS SHATTERED WHEN THE GREAT ENEMY INVADED.

MANY PUZZLES ARE PRESENTED IN THE FORM OF CRYPTIC TEXT MESSAGES (DISPLAYED IN A NEAT PSEUDO-CELTIC FONT), RANGING FORM 'FIND MY CROWN FOR A GIFT' TO 'THE BACKDOOR KEY IS ME' - LATERAL THINKING IS REQUIRED TO INTERPRET THESE MESSAGES. 

THE ACTION SIDE OF THINGS IS CHALLENGING, ESPECIALLY BEFORE YOU HAVE FOUND A GOOD SWORD OR MACE. WHEN YOU DIE, YOU RETURN TO THE START OF THE GAME, BUT THE SETTINGS OF OBJECTS ARE LEFT EXACTLY AS THEY WERE - MAKING IT IMPORTANT TO REGULARLY SAVE THE GAME, AS IT'S POSSIBLE TO LOSE WEAPONRY IN A SITUATION SO PRECARIOUS THAT YOU HAVE LITTLE CHANCE OF RETRIEVING IT WITHOUT SUFFERING MORE COMBAT.</desc>

SOME OF THE LEVELS DIFFER IN GAMEPLAY, AND RANGE BETWEEN ACTION AND DRIVING SCENES. THE ACTION SCENES MAINLY REQUIRE YOU TO COLLECT SOME ITEMS BEFORE LEAVING THE LEVEL.

		<desc>YOUR HOME SOLAR SYSTEM OF 15 PLANETS HAS BEEN ATTACKED BY A HORDE OF SUPER DREADNOUGHTS, FROM A RACE WHO WISH TO HARVEST YOUR UNIVERSE'S MINERALS FOR THEIR OWN USE.

YOU MUST PILOT YOUR CRAFT THROUGH SOME OF THE HARDEST LEVELS EVER CREATED AND SHOOT DOWN ALL THE ENEMY SPACE CRAFT AND GROUND WEAPONS, AND AVOID THE MANY INDESTRUCTIBLE HAZARDS. 

THE INNOVATION IS THAT YOU DO NOT SIMPLY TRAVEL IN A SINGLE DIRECTION, BUT INSTEAD MOVE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT OR RIGHT TO LEFT DEPENDING ON WHERE THE CURRENT TARGETS ARE, IN A MANNER MORE SIMILAR TO DEFENDER THAN MOST SHOOT 'EM UPS.</desc>

THE PARK IS MADE UP OF FOUR LINKED LEVELS OF ROAD, WHICH YOU CAN MOVE UP AND DOWN AT BY FINDING A RAMP HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION AND MOVING THE JOYSTICK IN THAT DIRECTION. STANDARD DIRECTION CHANGES ON EACH PIECE OF ROAD MUST ALSO BE NAVIGATED.

THERE ARE MANY CREATURES TO AVOID OR JUMP OVER - MUTANT KANGAROOS AND HEDGEHOGS FOR STARTERS. STANDARD HAZARDS SUCH AS RAMPS AND SCHOOL BUSES ARE DEALT WITH BY PULLING A WHEELIE - IN THIS CASE, JUMPING AT THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT WHILE AT TOP SPEED</desc>

OBJECTS INCLUDING WEAPONS AND FIRST AID KITS CAN BE COLLECTED.

		<desc>IN WIZBALL THE PLAYER TAKES THE ROLE OF THE FRIENDLY WIZARD WIZ WHO CAN TURN HIMSELF INTO A GREEN BALL THAT IS ABLE TO DEFEND HIS WORLD AGAINST THE COLOR-SUCKING ENEMIES WHO HAVE TURNED HIS ONCE BRIGHTLY COLORED WIZWORLD INTO A DRAB PLANET. WITH HIS TRUSTY FELINE COMPANION CATELITE, THE WIZARD WILL RESTORE THE COLORS TO THE WORLD BY RETRIEVING THEM FROM DEFEATED ENEMIES.

THE PLAYER STARTS OUT AS A BOUNCING GREEN BALL THAT CAN SHOOT AND BE PUT INTO MORE OR LESS HEAVY ROTATION TO MOVE SLOWLY OR FASTER, PHYSICALLY CORRECT THROUGH THE SIDE-SCROLLING LEVELS. THE FIRST TASK IS TO UPGRADE THE BALL BY SHOOTING THE FIRST NON-MOVING ENEMIES, AND COLLECT THE GREEN BUBBLES THAT ARE LEFT BY THEM. IN ORDER TO STAND A CHANCE AGAINST THE FOLLOWING MOVING ENEMY WAVES, SOME UPGRADES ARE A MUST. FIRST AND FOREMOST, COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE BALL SHOULD BE ACTIVATED (I.E. FLYING THROUGH THE LEVELS), A SHIELD SHELTERING THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE PLAYER'S SHOULD BE ACQUIRED, AND TWO-WAY FIRE (LEFT/RIGHT) SHOULD BE OBTAINED.

BUT THE EXTRA NEEDED TO ADVANCE IN WIZBALL IS YOUR FRIEND CATELITE WHO WILL, ONCE SUMMONED, TAKE THE FORM OF A SMALL GREEN SATELLITE THAT WILL IMITATE THE BALL'S MOVEMENT, OR CAN BE DIRECTLY CONTROLLED BY THE PLAYER. BESIDES UPPING WIZ' FIRE POWER, CATELITE IS ABLE TO COLLECT PAINT DROPS LEFT BY A CERTAIN KIND OF DEFEATED ENEMIES UNTIL THE RESPECTIVE COLOR POT IS FILLED UP. THERE'S THREE COLORS AVAILABLE (RED, GREEN AND BLUE), AND SEVERAL DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF THEM MUST BE COLLECTED TO COMPLETE A LEVEL AND RESTORE IT TO FORMER COLORFULNESS. EVERY COLOR COMBINATION COLLECTED WILL SEND WIZ TO A BONUS STAGE, THEN TO HIS LABORATORY WHERE ONE OF THE POWER-UPS CAN BE MADE PERMANENTLY.

THE GAME ALSO FEATURES A BUNCH OF MULTI-PLAYER MODES, THERE'S EVEN A TWO-PLAYER COOPERATIVE MODE AMONGST THEM.</desc>

VIEWED FORM ABOVE THE GAME IS MAZE-BASED, WITH LOTS OF ATIC ATAC STYLE SECTIONS WHERE YOU CAN SEE OTHER PARTS OF THE LEVEL ON THE SAME SCREEN, BUT CAN'T ACCESS THEM BECAUSE THE DESIGN OF THE MAZE PUTS SOMETHING IN THE WAY. GRAPHICS ARE QUITE LARGE AND CHUNKY - THIS IS PERHAPS THE CLOSEST ANYONE CAME TO BORROWING RAPSCALLION'S UNUSUAL VISUAL DESIGN.

YOU HAVE AN ENERGY BAR WHICH DECREASES CONSTANTLY, AND CONTACT WITH THE ANTS, SPIDERS AND THE REST OF THE SICKLY CREATURES REDUCES THIS FURTHER. FORTUNATELY YOU CAN OBTAIN APPLES, CHERRIES, CUPS OF TEA (I SUSPECT A GENERATION OF SADISTIC 10-YEAR-OLDS STARTED TRYING TO PLY WORMS WITH CAFFEINE AS A RESULT OF THIS) AND OTHER FOODSTUFFS TO RECHARGE THIS. THESE CAN BE EATEN IMMEDIATELY OR STORED FOR LATER USE, HOWEVER YOU CAN ONLY HOLD ONE OBJECT AT A TIME. MANY OTHER ITEMS ARE NEEDED TO GET PAST SITUATIONS DURING THE GAME, SO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU KEEP TO AVOID TOO MUCH BACKTRACKING THROUGH THE 256 SCREENS.</desc>

THE XYBOTS ARE OUT TO STOP YOU, OF COURSE, AND MANY HAVE ADVANCED ATTACK PATTERNS AS WELL AS BULLETS TO FIRE AT YOU. BEING ABLE TO VIEW ROUND CORNERS IS USEFUL, ALLOWING YOU TO PLAN A STRATEGY - OFTEN IT'S GOOD TO SEND ONE PLAYER FORWARD AND LET THE OTHER PLAY THE WAITING GAME, AS IN GAUNTLET.</desc>
