		<name>4 in 1 Row</name>
		<desc>4 IN 1 ROW IS A TRANSLATION OF THE CONNECT FOUR BOARD GAME. TWO PLAYERS (PUSSYCAT AND HOUNDDOG) TAKE TURNS DROPPING COLORED (RED OR GREEN) DISCS IN AN EIGHT-COLUMN SIX-ROW GRID. THE OBJECT IS TO PLACE 4 DISCS IN A ROW, EITHER VERTICALLY, HORIZONTALLY OR DIAGONALLY.

AN STRATEGIC INDICATOR NUMBER ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN, BESIDES EACH NAME, WILL SHOW THE CHANCES OF EACH PLAYER TO GET FOUR DISCS IN A ROW. THE HIGHER THE NUMBER, THE HIGHER THE CHANCES. IF THE NUMBER READS 125 IT MEANS THE PLAYER IS JUST ONE MOVE AWAY FROM WINNING. THE STRATEGIC INDICATOR CAN BE TURNED OFF BY PRESSING CLEAR.

WHEN PLAYING AGAINST THE COMPUTER, TWO VARIATIONS WITH THREE SKILL LEVELS ARE AVAILABLE:

PLAYING AGAINST MICROCAT I, II OR III (SELECTED BY PRESSING 1, 2 OR 3). MICROCAT USES A MICRO-SENSOR (REPRESENTED BY A Âµ SIGN) WHICH WILL STOP OVER EACH COLUMN CALCULATING ITS CHANCES. THE DISC WILL BE DROPPED WHERE THE Âµ STOPS. THE HIGHER THE SKILL LEVEL, THE BIGGER THE SENSOR AND CALCULATION TIMES.

PLAYING AGAINST MICRODOG I, II OR III (SELECTED BY PRESSING 5, 6 OR 7) IS SIMILAR TO PLAYING AGAINST MICROCAT (WITH THE SKILL LEVELS AND Âµ SENSOR), BUT THE PLAYER CAN ALSO ASK FOR COMPUTER ASSISTANCE ON MOVES. WHENEVER PLAYER'S PUSSYCAT APPEARS, PRESSING 1, 2 OR 3, DEPENDING ON THE SKILL LEVEL, WILL MAKE THE PRESS ENTER TEXT APPEAR ALONG THE MICRO SENSOR. ONCE PRESSED, THE COMPUTER WILL TAKE OVER AND WILL CONTINUE UNTIL THE PLAYER PRESSES AGAIN 0 AND ENTER WHEN PUSSYCAT APPEARS.</desc>

		<name>Alien Invaders - Plus</name>
		<desc>THIS IS A SPACE INVADERS VARIANT WITH A TWIST. EIGHT ROBOTS WITH LASER CANNONS AND PROTECTED BY A SHIELD WALL ARE ADVANCING IN THE PLAYER'S SECTOR, AND WITH HIS LASER CANNON HE HAS TO DESTROY THEM. THE SHIELD WALL IS INDESTRUCTIBLE, BUT THE ROBOTS AND THE CANNONS AREN'T. THEY'LL GO FROM SIDE TO SIDE OF THE SCREEN IN AN ALTERNATE MOVEMENT SHOOTING DOWN. THREE HIGH DENSITY MOLECULAR LASER SHIELDS ARE PLACED IN DEFENSE OF THE LASER CANNON. EACH ONE OF THEM HOUSES AN EXTRA CANNON.

INSTEAD OF A PASSING FLYING SAUCER AS SEEN IN SPACE INVADERS, THE PLAYER HAS TO FACE THE MERCILESS MONSTROTH, WHICH SHOOTS AGAINST HIM. THE PLAYER CONTROLS A ROBOT DEFENDER INSIDE THE LASER CANNON. IF THE LASER CANNON IS DESTROYED, THE ROBOT WILL BE LEFT UNPROTECTED. THE ROBOT CAN ENTER IN A NEW LASER CANNON HOUSED IN ONE OF THE SHIELDS. ONCE THE NEW LASER CANNON IS ACTIVE, THE SHIELD IS GONE. ONCE THE THREE SHIELDS ARE GONE, THE MERCILESS MONSTROTH WILL COME DOWN TO HUNT THE PLAYER'S CANNON AND ROBOT.

THE PLAYER WINS A BATTLE WHEN DESTROYING ALL ENEMY ROBOTS AND CANNONS ON THE SCREEN. A BATTLE IS LOST WHEN THE PLAYER'S ROBOT IS DESTROYED. THE FIRST SIDE TO WIN TEN BATTLES WINS THE WAR.</desc>

DEPTH CHARGE IS A SINGLE-PLAYER BATTLESHIP VARIANT. THE PLAYER CONTROLS A CANNON IN A TOP-DOWN VIEW TRYING TO DESTROY 7 SUBMARINES HIDDEN IN THE AREA OF WATER SHOWN ON SCREEN. THE AREA IS A 8X8 GRID, AND THE PLAYER CONTROLS A WHITE CROSS-HAIR OVER IT WITH THE JOYSTICK. PRESSING THE ACTION BUTTON WILL SHOOT THE CANNON. IF A SUBMARINE IS HIDDEN IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA, A BLUE SQUARE WILL APPEAR, MARKING IT. IF THERE ARE NO SUBMARINES, THE GAME WILL WARN THE PLAYER WITH A SOUND AND THAT AREA WILL CONTINUE UNMARKED. THERE ARE SUBMARINES OF 4 DIFFERENT SIZES, WITH THERE BEING 3 WITH ONE SECTION EACH, 2 WITH 2 SECTIONS EACH, 1 WITH 3 SECTIONS AND 1 WITH 4 SECTIONS. THE GAME KEEPS TRACK OF THE NUMBER OF SHOTS TRIED BY THE PLAYER, AND THE TOTAL IS SHOWN AT THE END OF THE GAME, WHEN ALL SUBMARINES ARE DESTROYED.

MARKSMAN IS A SHOOTING GALLERY GAME. THE PLAYER CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN 2 GAME DURATIONS: 1 MINUTE OR 3 MINUTES. THE GAME IS PLAYED IN A FIRST PERSON PERSPECTIVE, WITH THE PLAYER SEEING THE RIFLE AND THE TARGETS IN FRONT OF IT. A LINE OF TARGETS WILL SCROLL FROM RIGHT TO LEFT, BOUNCING UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF THE RIFLE AND THE PLAYER HAS TO AIM AT THEM AND SHOOT. THERE ARE 9 DIFFERENT TARGETS WHICH GRANT THE PLAYER SCORES FROM 1 TO 9 POINTS EACH. WHEN THE PLAYER REACHES 100 POINTS, THE TARGETS START TO MOVE FASTER. THE GAME ENDS WHEN THE TIME REACHES 0:00 OR WHEN THE PLAYER RUNS OUT OF SHOTS (STARTING WITH 24).</desc>

		<desc>AS A PILOT OF THE EARTH FEDERATION, THE PLAYER HAS TO RESCUE PRISONERS IN ORBITING CONFINEMENT CRYSTALS, WHILE AVOIDING THE EMPIRE'S PULSAR WARSHIPS ATTACKS.

THE STARSHIP IS CONTROLLED USING BOTH JOYSTICKS. THE LEFT HAND JOYSTICK CONTROLS THE CONVENTIONAL SPACE DRIVE SYSTEM. WHILE IN THIS DRIVE SYSTEM, THE SHIP WILL MOVE ONLY TO THE LIMITS OF THAT SPECIFIC SCREEN. THE RIGHT HAND JOYSTICK CONTROLS THE HYPERSPACE DRIVE SYSTEM. WHEN USING THIS DRIVE SYSTEM, THE SHIP WILL TRAVEL AT A MUCH HIGHER SPEED, AND IT WILL SIDE-SCROLL TO THE DIRECTION GIVEN. FLYING TOWARD THE TOP OR BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN WILL STILL MAKE THE SHIP TRAVEL TO THE POSITION IT IS POSITIONED TOWARD. THE ACTION BUTTON IN BOTH JOYSTICKS CONTROLS THE SHIP'S LASER CANNON.

THE EMPIRE'S PULSAR WARSHIPS ATTACK RELEASING DRONE MINES. ANY CONTACT WITH EITHER THE WARSHIPS OR THE DRONE MINES WILL DISINTEGRATE THE PLAYER'S SHIP.

THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE VARIATIONS TO THIS GAME. IN THE ATTACK MODE, THE LASER CANNON IS ACTIVE AND THE PLAYER SCORE POINTS AS HE DESTROYS THE ENEMY SHIPS (5 POINTS) OR MINES (1) AND AS HE RESCUES THE PRISONERS (20). IN THE EVASION MODE, THE LASER CANNON IS INACTIVE, AND THE LONGER THE PLAYER EVADES THE PULSAR WARSHIPS, THE HIGHER THE SCORE. EXTRA POINTS (20) ARE GIVEN FOR EACH PRISONER RESCUED.

THE GAME CAN BE PLAYED BY ONE OR TWO PLAYERS. IN TWO PLAYERS MODE, PLAYER TWO ACTS AS A COPILOT, CONTROLLING THE SHIP'S HYPERSPACE DRIVE AND CANNON.</desc>

		<name>Interpol</name>
		<desc>INTERPOL IS A GAME FOR TWO PLAYERS, ONE CONTROLS TWO SPIES (RED CHARACTERS) AND THE OTHER CONTROLS TWO POLICE OFFICERS (BLUE CHARACTERS). THE SPIES ARE IN POSSESSION OF SECRET INFORMATION AND MUST TRY TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY WITH THEM, BY AIR OR BY SEA. THE POLICE OFFICERS HAVE TO STOP THEIR PLAN. THE AIRPORT AND THE PORT ARE BLOCKED BY THE POLICE, AND INDIVIDUALS INTERESTED IN TRAVELING MUST PRESENT A CODE WHICH ONLY THE POLICE KNOWS.

THE MAIN SCREEN REPRESENTS A TOWN, WITH U-SHAPED BOXES WITH NUMBERS FROM ONE TO NINE INSIDE REPRESENTING BUILDINGS. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME, THE PLAYER CONTROLLING THE POLICE MUST DEFINE THE CODE WHICH BLOCKS THE AIRPORT AND PORT (REPRESENTED BY AN AIRPLANE AND A SHIP). THE CODE MUST BE A WORD OF FIVE LETTERS. AS THE PLAYER ENTERS EACH LETTER, HE OR SHE MUST ASSIGN A BUILDING TO STORE THAT LETTER, BY ENTERING ITS NUMBER. ONCE ALL LETTERS ARE STORED, THE GAME BEGINS. THE PLAYER CONTROLLING THE SPIES MUST CHOOSE ONE OF THEM AND START MOVING AROUND THE TOWN SEARCHING FOR THE LETTERS. WHILE MOVING, THE SELECTED SPY BECOMES INVISIBLE SO THE POLICE OFFICER WON'T SEE WHICH WAY THE SPY TAKES. AT ONE TURN, MOVEMENT CAN ONLY BE VERTICAL OR HORIZONTAL, SO IF THE PLAYER CHOOSES TO MOVE HORIZONTALLY, HE OR SHE WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO MOVE VERTICALLY IN THE NEXT TURN. AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, A RED CHARACTER WILL BE SHOWN WALKING AND LITTLE GREEN BARS WILL PASS HIM BY, TELLING HOW MANY "SPACES" HE HAS MOVED. EACH TURN MAY LAST FIVE TO 60 SECONDS, DEPENDING ON THE CHOICE THE PLAYERS MADE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME (DIFFERENT DURATIONS CAN BE SET FOR EACH PLAYER). THE TURN ENDS WHEN THE TIME IS OVER OR WHEN THE PLAYER PRESSES A BUTTON. THE PLAYER CONTROLLING THE POLICE OFFICERS CHOOSES ONE OF THEM AND STARTS MOVING, TRYING TO CATCH THE SPIES. WHEN THE PLAYER THINKS THE POLICE CHARACTER IS IN THE SAME SPACE THE SPY IS, HE OR SHE MUST PRESS THE ACTION BUTTON. IF THE SPY IS REALLY THERE, HE IS CAPTURED, IF NOT, THE PLAYER CONTROLLING THE POLICE OFFICERS JUST ENDS HIS OR HER TURN.

THE GAME ENDS WHEN THE POLICE CAPTURES BOTH SPIES OR WHEN ONE OF THE SPIES GETS TO THE AIRPORT OR THE PORT AND ENTERS THE CORRECT WORD.</desc>

THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL SUGGESTS THE FOLLOWING GAMES THAT CAN BE PLAYED:

MOVIE MADNESS!: 1 PLAYER NAMES A MOVIE AND IT'S UP TO THE OTHER PLAYER TO TYPE IN AS MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT MOVIE. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO FILL IN AS MANY CHARACTERS(UP TO 99) OF THE MAIN MESSAGE AS POSSIBLE WITHIN AN AGREED AMOUNT OF TIME. THEN PLAYER 2 TAKES HIS TURN AND THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST CHARACTERS FILLED IN WINS.

SPORTSCASTER!: PLAYED THE SAME WAY AS MOVIE MADNESS, EXCEPT THIS TIME INVOLVES NAMING PLAYERS OF SPORTS TEAMS INSTEAD.

IDENTOGRAMS!: ONE PLAYER ENTERS A SERIES OF CLUES ON A SUBJECT AND THE OTHER PLAYER HAS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME TO IDENTIFY THE SUBJECT. IF THE SUBJECT IS DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN BEFORE THE PLAYER GUESSES IT, THE PLAYER LOSES THE GAME.

SOURCE WORD!: ONE PLAYER NAMES A SOURCE WORD AND THE OTHER PLAYER HAS ONLY 5 MINUTES TO TYPE IN AS MANY WORD VARIATIONS AS THEY CAN  BY USING ONLY THE LETTERS CONTAINED IN THE SOURCE WORD. THE WORDS MAY BE OF ANY LENGTH BUT NO LETTER CAN BE USED MORE THAN IT APPEARS IN THE SOURCE WORD. THEN PLAYER 2 TAKES HIS TURN AND THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST CHARACTERS FILLED IN WINS.

TELL TALE!: PLAYERS TAKE TURNS ENTERING WORDS OF A SENTENCE. A PLAYER COMPLETING THE SENTENCE BEFORE THE 98TH CHARACTER IS OUT OF THE GAME. A PLAYER UNABLE TO COMPLETE A SENTENCE ON EXACTLY THE 98TH SPACE IS OUT OF THE GAME. THE GAME CONTINUES UNTIL ONLY ONE PLAYER IS LEFT. IF A PLAYER ENDS THE SENTENCE ON EXACTLY THE 98TH SPACE, THAT PLAYER IS THE WINNER OF THE GAME.

NINCOMPOOP!: PLAYER 1 NAMES ANY VOWEL THE NINCOMPOOP. THEN PLAYERS TAKE TURNS ENTERING WORDS OF INCREASING LENGTH (FROM 2-5 CHARACTERS, THEN THE CYCLE REPEATS). ANYTIME THE NINCOMPOOP VOWEL IS USED THE PLAYER TYPES NINCOMPOOP IN, INSTEAD OF THE VOWEL THAT WOULD USUALLY BELONG THERE. A PLAYER WHO CANNOT FIT A WORD OF THE REQUIRED LENGTH INTO THE 99TH SPACE IS OUT OF THE GAME. AFTER THAT PLAYER IS ELIMINATED, THE GAME STARTS WITH ANEW. THE LAST SURVIVING PLAYER IS THE WINNER.

CHAIN LETTERS!: ONE PLAYER NAMES A CATEGORY THEN TYPES IN A WORD THAT WOULD FIT IN THAT CATEGORY. THEN THE NEXT PLAYER HAS TO TYPE IN A WORD THAT STARTS WITH THE LAST LETTER OF THAT WORD THAT STILL FITS IN THE CURRENT CATEGORY. A PLAYER BREAKING THE LETTER CHAIN IS OUT OF THE GAME AND THE SURVIVING PLAYERS CONTINUE.UNTIL ONLY ONE PLAYER IS LEFT, OR UNTIL A PLAYER ENDS A CHAIN ON EXACTLY THE 99TH SPACE. IF A PLAYER CANNOT NAME A CATEGORY WORD THAT FITS INTO THE 99TH SPACE, THAT PLAYER LOSES. A NEW CATEGORY IS SELECTED AFTER THAT, WITH THE OTHER SURVIVING PLAYERS CONTINUING ON THE GAME.

THE PLAYER CONTROL THE WHITE BEES SWARM, TRYING TO KILL THE BEEBOTS BY FLYING OVER THEM AND STINGING THEM. THE LONGER THE SWARM FLIES OVER A BEEBOT, THE SLOWER IT MOVES, UNTIL IT FINALLY STOPS AND DIES. WHEN A BEEBOT DIES, A GRAVE MARKER WILL BE RAISED IN ITS PLACE, MAKING THE MOVEMENT OF THE REMAINING BEEBOTS MORE DIFFICULT. THE RED BEEBOTS MOVE CLOCKWISE, THE BLUE ONES MOVE COUNTERCLOCKWISE.

THE BEEBOTS ARE PROTECTED BY SWARMS OF KILLER BEES. IF A SWARM OF KILLER BEES ATTACKS THE PLAYER'S SWARM, IT WILL LOSE ITS BEES GRADUALLY, UNTIL NONE ARE LEFT AND THE GAME IS OVER. THE LONGER THE KILLER BEES STAY ON SCREEN, THE STRONGER THEY GET. THEY'LL CHANGE THEIR COLORS GRADUALLY, FROM GREEN (THE LESS HARMFUL) TO BLUE AND THEN FINALLY TO RED (THE MOST DANGEROUS).

THE ONLY DEFENSE THE PLAYER HAS AGAINST THE KILLER BEES IS THE BUG-ZAPPING ROSHA RAY, RELEASED BY PRESSING THE ACTION BUTTON. IT IS RECHARGED EACH TIME A BEEBOT IS KILLED, AND IT FOLLOWS THE WHITE BEES SWARM VERTICAL MOVEMENT. ONCE ALL BEEBOTS ARE KILLED, THE ROUND ENDS, AND A NEW ONE STARTS WITH A NEW LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY. THERE ARE 26 DIFFICULTY LEVELS.

THE PLAYER SCORES ONE POINT PER STING, TEN POINTS PER ZAPPED SWARM AND 100 POINTS PER BEEBOT KILLED. AT THE END OF EACH ROUND, A BONUS IS ALSO GIVEN, CONSISTING IN TEN POINTS PER EACH SURVIVOR BEE, MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF THE ROUND.</desc>

A LABYRINTH GAME IS EXACTLY WHAT THE TITLE DEFINES. THE PLAYER HAS TO MOVE A PAWN FROM THE LEFT SIDE OF A LABYRINTH TO THE EXIT ON THE RIGHT SIDE. EACH MATCH CONSISTS IN A SERIES OF 10 AND THE LABYRINTH ALWAYS CHANGES WHEN STARTING A NEW GAME. THE PAWN IS CONTROLLED WITH THE JOYSTICK AND THE "ACTION" MAKES IT MOVE FASTER. THERE ARE 16 POSSIBLE VARIATIONS, INCLUDING STATIONARY AND MOVING PATTERNS AND EXITS, FOR ONE PLAYER, TWO PLAYERS OR ONE PLAYER AGAINST THE COMPUTER (A "CAT AND MOUSE" GAME WHERE THE COMPUTER PLAYS A PAWN WHICH TRIES TO CATCH THE PLAYER'S PAWN).

SUPERMIND IS A CODE BREAKING GAME. FOUR QUESTION MARKS WILL BE DISPLAYED, ALONG WITH THE NUMBER OF SYMBOLS LEFT TO BE ENTERED (4 AT THE START). THE PLAYER ENTERS FOUR SYMBOLS OF CHOICE AND IF THEY'RE CORRECT BUT MISPLACED, A RED NUMBER WILL APPEAR IN THE RIGHT OF THE SCREEN (WITH THE NUMBER OF CORRECT SYMBOLS GUESSED). IF THE SYMBOL IS CORRECT AND PLACED IN THE RIGHT ORDER, IT WILL BE DISPLAYED IN WHITE. THE COMPUTER KEEPS TRACK OF THE NUMBER OF TRIES TAKEN AND THE GAME ENDS WHEN ALL SYMBOLS WERE DISCOVERED AND PLACED IN THE RIGHT ORDER.</desc>

		<name>Las Vegas Blackjack!</name>
		<desc>ONE OR TWO PLAYERS CAN PLAY AGAINST THE COMPUTER IN THIS BLACKJACK GAME.

EACH PLAYER STARTS WITH $1000. AFTER PLACING THEIR BETS (THROUGH THE KEYBOARD), THE DEALER SHUFFLES THE CARDS AND DEALS TWO FACE-UP CARDS FOR EACH PLAYER AND ONE FACE-UP CARD AND ONE FACE-DOWN CARD TO HIMSELF. HE THEN ASKS THE PLAYERS TO HIT MORE CARDS OR NOT (UP TO FIVE). AFTER EACH PLAYER HAS BEEN DEALT A FULL HAND, THE DEALER REVEALS HIS FACE-DOWN CARD. HE'LL TAKE A HIT IF HE HAS A TOTAL OF 16 OR LESS.

BLACKJACK OR FIVE CARDS WITHOUT A BUST PAYS DOUBLE. THE NEAREST TO 21 HANDS PAYS EVEN. NO MONEY IS PAID IF THERE IS A TIE.

THE COMPUTER OFFERS AN INSURANCE BET IF THE DEALER'S FIRST CARD IS AN ACE. IF THE PLAYER ACCEPTS AND THE DEALER GOES BLACKJACK, THE PLAYER WILL LOSE NO MONEY. OTHERWISE, HE WILL WIN OR LOSE THE CURRENT BET PLUS A HALF.

SOMETIMES THE COMPUTER WILL ALSO OFFER A DOUBLE DOWN. IF THE PLAYER ACCEPTS, THE BET IS DOUBLED AND HE WILL GET JUST ONE MORE CARD.</desc>

		<name>Le Mur Magique</name>
		<desc>TWO VARIATIONS OF BREAKOUT ARE AVAILABLE IN THIS TITLE.
IN BLOCKOUT!, THE OBJECT IS TO BLAST THROUGH THE BLOCKS IN THE SHORTEST AMOUNT OF TIME. THERE ARE FOUR COLORED LINES OF BLOCKS, AND EACH LINE HAS AN ELECTRONIC DEMON. THE ELECTRONIC DEMONS CAN REPLACE REMOVED BLOCKS WHEN CHARGED. THEY'LL BE CHARGED BY TOUCHING EITHER SIDES OF THE SCREEN. AFTER PLACING A BLOCK, THEY'LL LOSE THE CHARGE, AND IF THEY TRY TO CROSS A GAP UNCHARGED, THEY'LL FALL AND REAPPEAR AFTER A PENALTY TIME.

IN TWO PLAYERS MODE, THE SECOND PLAYER CONTROLS THE ELECTRONIC DEMONS AS THEY TRY TO PREVENT THE FIRST PLAYER TO BLAST THROUGH THE BARRICADE. THE PLAYER HAS 90 SECONDS TO TRY ACHIEVING IT.


IN BREAKDOWN!, THE OBJECT IS TO DESTROY THE MOST BLOCKS THE PLAYER CAN WITHIN 60 SECONDS. UNLIKE IN BLOCKOUT!, THE BALL (CALLED BLOCKBUSTER) WILL NOT RICOCHET WHEN HITTING BLOCKS, ONLY WHEN HITTING THE SCREEN EDGES, DESTROYING ALL THE BLOCKS IT CROSSES ON ITS WAY.

IN TWO PLAYERS MODE THE SECOND PLAYER AGAIN CONTROLS THE ELECTRONIC DEMOS, WHICH NOW MOVE TWICE FASTER THAN IN BLOCKOUT!. A COUNTER AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN MARKS HOW MANY BLOCKS ARE LEFT.
IN BOTH VARIATIONS, THE NUMBER OF BLOCKBUSTERS (BALLS) IS UNLIMITED.</desc>

		<name>Loony Balloon</name>
		<desc>IN LOONY BALLOON, THE PLAYER CONTROLS A KID CARRYING A SWAYING BALLOON CROSSING A PLAYGROUND. TO GET OUT OF THE PLAYGROUND, HE MUST REDUCE THE BALLOON'S SWAY, OR IT WILL BURST WHEN HE CROSSES THE EXIT. TO DO SO, HE MUST EARN 50 POINTS BY PLAYING IN THE VARIOUS AMUSEMENTS OF THE PLAYGROUND.

THERE ARE FOUR KINDS OF AMUSEMENTS: A ROCKING HORSE, A SLIDE, A ROUNDABOUT AND TREES. THE BOY WILL ALSO FIND THREATS TO HIS BALLOON ALONG THE WAY, LIKE BIRDS THAT WILL CROSS THE SCREEN FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, TRYING TO BURST IT, AND SUDDEN GUSTS OF WIND, WHICH WILL TAKE THE BALLOON OUT FROM THE BOY'S GRASP IF HE STANDS STILL FOR TOO LONG.

THE BOY CAN RELEASE THE BALLOON AT ANY TIME AND GRAB IT AGAIN BY ITS STRING (BY PRESSING THE ACTION BUTTON). IF THE BALLOON HITS A WALL, IT WILL BURST AND THE GAME IS OVER. THE LONGER THE GAME IS PLAYED, THE QUICKER THE BALLOON RISES IF RELEASED.

THE PLAYER SCORES:

1. 2 POINTS BY CATCHING THE BALLOON;
2. 5 POINTS BY PLAYING AT A TREE;
3. 7 POINTS BY PLAYING AT THE ROCKING HORSE;
4. 8 POINTS BY EVADING A BIRD;
5. 10 POINTS BY PLAYING AT THE SLIDE;
6. 12 POINTS BY PLAYING AT THE ROUNDABOUT;
7. 25 POINTS BY LEAVING THE PLAYGROUND.

THERE ARE 10 DIFFICULTY LEVELS. FROM LEVELS 0 TO 4, THE PLAYGROUND LAYOUT IS FIXED. FROM LEVELS 5 TO 9, THE WALLS IN THE PLAYGROUND WILL APPEAR, DISAPPEAR AND CHANGE PLACES.</desc>

A MARTIAN SPACE SHIP IS ORBITING THE EARTH AND A BIG LASER CANNON IS BEING BUILT ON EARTH AND IT IS THE PLAYER'S MISSION TO HOLD THE MARTIAN THREAT UNTIL THE LASER CANNON IS COMPLETE. TO DO SO, THE SIDO (SPACE INTRUDER DEFENSE ORGANISATION) INFILTRATED A FIGHTING PROBE INSIDE THE MARTIAN SPACESHIP.

IN MARTIAN THREAT THE PLAYER CONTROLS A FIGHTING PROBE WITH THE JOYSTICK. THE LACK OF GRAVITY WILL MAKE THE PROBE KEEP MOVING UNTIL REVERSE THRUST IS GIVEN. THE PLAYER HAS TO SHOOT MARTIANS AND THEIR ENERGY BOMBS, WHICH WILL APPEAR IN FOUR DIFFERENT SPOTS. THE PROBE CAN ONLY SHOOT DIAGONALLY. AT THE START, THE MARTIAN BOMBS ARE GREEN AND HAVE LITTLE ENERGY ON THEM. AS THE GAME PROCEEDS THE BOMBS TURN BLUE, PURPLE AND FINALLY RED. THE PROBE CAN TAKE UP TO TEN HITS FROM GREEN BOMBS, BUT ONLY THREE HITS FROM RED BOMBS. ADDITIONALLY, THE BOMBS WILL MOVE FASTER AND WHEN THEY HIT THE PROBE THEY'LL PUSH IT AWAY. THE PROBE EXPLODES IF IT HITS THE SPACE SHIP'S WALLS.

THE GAME HAS TWO POSSIBLE ENDINGS. IF THE PLAYER SUCCEEDS IN DEFENDING THE EARTH FOR 64 SECONDS (77 SECONDS IN PAL SYSTEMS), THE LASER DEFENSE WILL BE FINISHED AND EARTH WILL BE SAVED. IF THE PROBE GETS DESTROYED BEFORE THAT, THE MARTIANS WILL RELEASE THEIR VIRUS BOMB AND DESTROY ALL LIFE ON EARTH.</desc>

		<desc>MATH-A-MAGIC! IS AN "ELECTRONIC ARITHMETIC TEACHER". THE PLAYER CAN CHOSE UP TO THREE VARIATIONS OF MATHEMATICAL GAMES.

IN THE FIRST VARIATION, THE PLAYER WILL HAVE TO SOLVE REGULAR MATH PROBLEMS. HE FIRST CHOOSES THE KIND OF OPERATION (ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION OR DIVISION), NEXT THE SKILL LEVEL (1-3) AND THEN IS PRESENTED WITH THE PROBLEMS. HE MUST TYPE IN THE ANSWERS, AND THE COMPUTER WILL REGISTER THE TIME ELAPSED AND THE NUMBER OF CURRENT PROBLEMS SOLVED. IF THE PLAYER FAILS TWICE TO SOLVE A PROBLEM, THE GAME IS OVER.

THE SECOND VARIATION DISPLAYS ALGEBRAIC PROBLEMS. THE PLAYER SELECTS THE DESIRED SKILL LEVEL (1-3) AND HAS TO ENTER THE MISSING VARIABLE TO EACH PROBLEM, AND THE RULES ARE THE SAME TO THE FIRST VARIATION.

THE THIRD VARIATION IS A ADDITION OR MULTIPLICATION TABLE GAME. THE PLAYER CHOOSES ADDITION OR MULTIPLICATION, THEN THE NUMBER HE WISHES TO PRACTICE.

ECHO! IS A BASIC SIMON GAME (AS INVENTED BY RALPH H. BAER). FOUR COLORED NUMBERS (RED, BLUE, GREEN, AND YELLOW) WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN. ONE OF THEM WILL LIGHT UP, AND A TONE WILL BE PLAYED. THEN IT IS THE PLAYER'S TURN: HE HAS TO MATCH THE LIT UP NUMBER. THEN, THE FIRST NUMBER WILL BE LIGHT UP FOLLOWED BY A SECOND ONE. THE PLAYER HAS TO MATCH THE SEQUENCE AND IT WILL KEEP INCREASING INDEFINITELY. IF THE PLAYER FAILS THREE TIMES TO MATCH A SEQUENCE, THE GAME IS OVER.</desc>

		<name>Missao Impossivel</name>
		<desc>TWO TITLES ARE AVAILABLE IN THIS CART:

MISSION IMPOSSIBLE IS AN ACTION GAME. THE PLAYER MUST PROTECT A CARGO SHIP (WHITE CRAFT) WHICH TRAVELS ON A LAY LINES FROM BOUNTY HUNTERS (RED CRAFTS), WHICH WILL DESTROY THE CARGO SHIP IF THEY CROSS ITS WAY. AS THE CARGO SHIP MOVES ALONG THE LAY LINES, THE PLAYER MUST PLACE NGR BOTS (GREEN X SYMBOLS) AT THE LAY LINE INTERSECTIONS TO CHANGE TRAFFIC; THE PLAYER HAS 7 NGR BOTS AND CAN REPLACE THEM. WHEN ANY SHIPS REACHES AN NGR BOT, IT WILL TURN RIGHT IF TRAVELING VERTICALLY OR TURN TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN WHEN TRAVELING HORIZONTALLY. RED MUSHROOM-SHAPED POWER UPS, WHEN PICKED UP ALLOW THE CARGO SHIP TO DESTROY THE BOUNTY HUNTERS; ALTERNATIVELY, BOUNTY HUNTERS CAN BE SIMPLY DIRECTED TO THEM AND WILL BE DESTROYED. WHITE X MARKS WILL SEND THE CARGO SHIP BACK IN THE OPPOSITE WAY IT WAS TRAVELING; IF HIT BY A BOUNTY HUNTER, THEY WILL ALSO SEND THEM BACK, BUT WILL BE DESTROYED. LILAC SQUARES ARE MINES WHICH WILL DESTROY ANY SHIP THAT PASSES OVER THEM. FINALLY, BLUE DOTS WILL GIVE BOUNTY HUNTERS AN EXTRA LIFE IF TAKEN BY THEM. THE PLAYER AND THE BOUNTY HUNTERS START WITH 15 LIVES EACH, THE FIRST TO DROP TO ZERO LOSES.

PROGRAMMED TRIP IS A TURN BASED GAME WHICH SHARES MANY ELEMENTS FROM THE PREVIOUS GAME. AS THE NAME IMPLIES, THE PLAYER HAS TO PROGRAM THE TRIP OF THE CARGO FIELD SO IT PASSES OVER PICKUP POINTS (COLORED + SYMBOLS) IN A SPECIFIC ORDER: FIRST LILAC, THEN RED, THEN BLUE. TO DO SO, NGR BOTS CAN BE PLACED TO REDIRECT THE SHIP, AND SOME FIELDS MAY ALSO HAVE WHITE X MARKS ALREADY PLACED. AFTER ALL DESIRED NGR BOTS ARE PLACED, THE PLAYER CAN RELEASE THE CARGO SHIP BY PLACING THE CURSOR OVER THE UPPER LEFT CORNER AND PRESSING THE ACTION BUTTON. WHEN THE CARGO SHIP IS RELEASED THE PLAYER HAS 30 POINTS. PASSING OVER PICKUP POINTS IN THE CORRECT ORDER ADDS 20 POINTS TO THE SCORE, WHILE PASSING OVER THEM IN THE WRONG ORDER OR HITTING ANY OTHER ITEM (NGR BOTS OR WHITE X MARKS, FOR INSTANCE) SUBTRACTS 10 POINTS FROM THE SCORE. THE GAME IS OVER EITHER WHEN THE SCORE REACHES 0 OR WHEN ALL PICKUP POINTS WERE REACHED IN THE RIGHT ORDER (IN WHICH CASE THEY'LL TURN WHITE).</desc>

THE PLAYER SELECTS THE GAME SPEED (4 TO 30 WORDS PER MINUTE) AND LEVEL (1 TO ALL 36 CHARACTERS AVAILABLE). THE COMPUTER WILL PLAY THE MORSE SIGNAL FOR THE FIRST SYMBOL (Q) AND THE PLAYER HAS TO TYPE IN THE SYMBOL. AFTER LEARNING TWO SIGNALS, THE GAME STARTS PROPERLY BY INTRODUCING A ROW OF TREES IN THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. AN ARROW IS ALSO DISPLAYED NEAR THE 4TH TREE FROM THE LEFT AND A MAN ON THE RIGHT SIDE. FOR EACH 10 CORRECTLY RESPONDED SYMBOLS THE MAN TAKES DOWN ONE TREE. WHEN HE REACHES THE ARROW, A NEW SYMBOL IS INTRODUCED AND THE PROCESS STARTS OVER AGAIN. THE SEQUENCE OF SYMBOLS IS: Q, 7, Z, G, 0, 9, 8, O, 1, J, P, W, L, R, A, M, 6, B, X, D, Y, C, K, N, 2, 3, F, U, 4, 5, V, H, S, I, T AND E.

2. THE SECOND TYPE LETS THE PLAYER TYPE INDIVIDUAL SYMBOLS AND LISTEN TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CODES.

3. THE THIRD TYPE IS SIMILAR TO THE SECOND ONE, BUT IN THIS ONE THE PLAYER TYPES A SEQUENCE OF SYMBOLS AND THEN PRESS "ENTER" TO ASK THE COMPUTER TO PLAY THE RESPECTIVE CODE.

4. IN THE FOURTH TYPE THE PLAYER USES THE "ACTION" BUTTON OF THE JOYSTICK TO ENTER CODES INTO AND THE COMPUTER PLAYS THEM AND SHOWS THE RESPECTIVE SYMBOL ENTERED.</desc>

		<name>Nightmare</name>
		<desc>IN NIGHTMARE THE PLAYER CONTROLS A VISITOR TO A HAUNTED MANSION. THE GOAL IS TO ESCAPE FROM IT THROUGH A CONSTANTLY MOVING HATCH IN THE ATTIC. HIS JOB WILL BE MADE HARDER BY THE GHOSTS WHO ARE STILL LINGERING AROUND THE HOUSE. THE PLAYER HAS TO CLIMB THREE FLOORS TO REACH THE ATTIC, AND THERE IS ONE GHOST FOR EACH FLOOR.

THE GHOSTS BECOME INVISIBLE AS THEY CROSS THE HOUSE'S WALLS. WHILE INVISIBLE THEY ARE HARMLESS, SO THEY HAVE TO MAKE THEMSELVES VISIBLE TO CATCH THE VISITOR. THEY'LL BECOME INVISIBLE AGAIN IF THEY CROSS THE HOUSE WALLS AGAIN. IF THEY CATCH THE VISITOR, HE'LL LOSE ONE OF HIS LIVES. BUT ONCE THE VISITOR HAS PAST THE GHOST'S FLOOR, THE GHOST WILL BE PARALYZED AND CAN BE CAUGHT BY THE VISITOR.

BESIDES THE GHOSTS, OTHER DANGERS THREATEN THE VISITOR. A THUNDERSTORM IS BREAKING OUT AND FLASHES OF LIGHTNING HIT THE MANSION, CREATING LIGHTNING BALLS WHICH WILL ROLL THROUGH THE FLOOR THE VISITOR IS IN. THE FLASHES WILL ALSO MAKE THE INVISIBLE GHOSTS VISIBLE WHILE THE LIGHTNINGS STRIKE. BESIDES, THE VISITOR CAN'T BE STANDING STILL FOR TOO LONG OR A TRAP DOOR WILL OPEN AND HE'LL FALL THROUGH IT, LOSING A LIFE. TO MAKE THINGS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT, THERE WILL BE ALSO A RANDOMLY PLACED OBSTACLE BLOCKING THE VISITOR'S WAY.

THE PLAYER STARTS WITH THREE LIVES AND GAINS ONE EACH TIME HE ESCAPES THE MANSION. AS THE PLAYER GROWS ON POINTS FROM REACHING THE ATTIC OR CAPTURING THE GHOSTS, THE GAME GETS MORE DIFFICULT. THE NUMBER OF OBSTACLES INCREASE AND THE EXIT BECOMES INVISIBLE UNLESS THE PLAYER CAPTURES A GHOST. IN HIGHER DIFFICULTY LEVELS CATCHING A GHOST WON'T BE ENOUGH, AS THE PLAYER WILL HAVE TO ALSO GET THE HOUSE'S GROUND PLAN, WHICH APPEARS ON A CHEST AFTER HE CAPTURES A GHOST.

THE GAME CAN BE PLAYED BY 2 PLAYERS, ONE OF THEM CONTROLLING THE GHOSTS IN THE HOUSE.</desc>

		<desc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desc>

		<name>Skiing</name>
		<desc>ONE OR TWO PLAYERS CAN CHOOSE AMONG THREE KINDS OF SKIING COMPETITIONS TO PLAY: SLALOM, GIANT SLALOM AND DOWN HILL.
IN THE SLALOM EVENT, PLAYERS MUST SKI THROUGH 55 GATES. THE WINNER IS THE FASTEST PLAYER TO CONCLUDE TWO RUNS DOWN THE COURSES. IF A PLAYER MISSES A GATE, THE TIMING STOPS AND THE COUNTER REGISTERS THE NUMBERS OF VIOLATIONS. THE WINNER THEN IS THE PLAYER WITH THE LESSER NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS.

THE GIANT SLALOM EVENT FOLLOWS THE SAME RULES TO THE SLALOM, BUT IS LONGER THAN THE SLALOM, WITH GATES FARTHER APART.

IN THE DOWN HILL EVENT, THE WINNER IS THE PLAYER TO ACHIEVE THE END OF THE MARKED COURSE IN THE SHORTEST AMOUNT OF TIME. IF THE PLAYER GOES OFF-COURSE, THE VIOLATIONS ARE COUNTED INSTEAD, AND THE WINNER IS THE PLAYER WITH THE LESSER NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS.
IN ANY EVENT, CRASHING INTO THE GATES WILL MAKE THE PLAYERS LOSE TIME. EACH PLAYER'S COURSE IS DISPLAYED AT ONE HALF OF THE SCREEN AND SEPARATELY, EVEN THOUGH THEIR PROGRESSES ARE SHOWN SIMULTANEOUSLY. PLAYERS CAN GO OFF-COURSE AND INVADE EACH OTHER'S COURSES, THOUGH.

THE PLAYERS SELECT THE EVENTS BY PULLING DOWN THE STICK WHEN THE DESIRED EVENT'S NAME IS DISPLAYED IN THE SCREEN. THE SKIERS ARE CONTROLLED WITH THE STICK. BY HOLDING THE STICK DOWN, THE SKIER RUNS DOWN IN A STRAIGHT LINE. BY PUSHING UP, THE SKIER STOPS. RIGHT AND LEFT WILL CHANGE THE SKIER DIRECTION AND PRESSING THE ACTION BUTTON WILL ACCELERATE THE SKIER IN 30% OF ITS SPEED.</desc>

		<desc>THREE GAMES ARE AVAILABLE IN THIS COMPILATION:
SPEEDWAY! (SELECTED BY PRESSING "1") IS A VERTICAL SCROLLING RACING GAME AGAINST THE CLOCK. THE PLAYER CONTROLS THE CAR WITH THE JOYSTICK, PUSHING UP TO ACCELERATE IT (THE LONGER, THE FASTER), LEFT AND RIGHT TO CONTROL DIRECTION AND DOWN TO BREAK.

THE FASTER THE CAR GOES, THE HIGHER THE SCORE. COLLISIONS HALT THE SCORE, BUT NOT THE CLOCK. THE PLAYER HAS TWO MINUTES TO RUN, UNTIL THE RACE ENDS.

THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE VARIATIONS: (1) QUALIFYING TIME TRIALS AND (2) THE MAIN EVENT (OPPONENT CARS ARE TWICE FASTER).


SPIN-OUT! (SELECTED BY PRESSING "2" FOR A THREE LAPS EVENT OR "3" FOR A 15 LAPS EVENT) IS A TOP-DOWN CIRCUIT RACING GAME. TWO PLAYERS RACE AGAINST EACH OTHER FOR THE AMOUNT OF TRACKS SELECTED. FOUR SKILL LEVELS ARE AVAILABLE: CLEAR TRACK/SLOW SPEED, CLEAR TRACK/FAST SPEED, BARRIER TRACK/SLOW SPEED AND BARRIER TRACK/FAST SPEED.

THE CAR IS CONTROLLED WITH THE DIRECTIONAL STICK, AND THE ACTION BUTTON DOUBLES THE CAR SPEED IN STRAIGHTAWAYS. IF THE CAR COLLIDES AGAINST THE WALL OR BARRIERS, IT CAN BREAK OR SPIN OUT, LOSING TIME. IF TWO CARS COLLIDE, ONE OF THEM WILL SPIN OUT.


CRYPTO-LOGIC! (SELECTED BY PRESSING "4") IS A PUZZLE GAME. THE OBJECT IS TO DECIPHER A SCRAMBLED WORD ENTERED BY ANOTHER PLAYER.

THE WORD CAN HAVE UP TO 14 LETTERS. AFTER ENTERING THE WORD OR MESSAGE, THE FIRST PLAYER PRESSES THE "ENTER" KEY TO SCRAMBLE IT. THE OTHER PLAYER HAS TO GUESS THE ORIGINAL WORD BY TYPING THE LETTERS IN THE LINE BELOW IT. LETTERS PLACED IN THE RIGHT ORDER WILL STAY, WRONG PLACED LETTERS WILL BE DISPLAYED FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND DISAPPEAR. WHEN THE CRYPTOGRAM IS SOLVED, THE NUMBER OF MISTAKES IS DISPLAYED ON SCREEN.</desc>

YOU'RE A CHOPPER PILOT ON A SURVEILLANCE MISSION IN ENEMY TERRITORY; YOUR GOAL IS TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE VARIOUS OBSTACLE COURSES ALIVE AND SCORE AS MANY POINTS AS POSSIBLE. TALL BUILDINGS, MOUNTAINS, NARROW TUNNELS, AND VARIOUS ENEMIES (SUCH AS TANKS, ROCKETS, MINES, AND MORE) CAN ALL GET IN THE WAY AND DESTROY YOUR CHOPPER IF YOU AREN'T CAREFUL. TO HELP DEFEND YOURSELF, THE CHOPPER IS ARMED WITH A MACHINE GUN AND BOMBS WHICH CAN BE USED TO DESTROY THE ENEMY TANKS AND ROCKETS. TO MAKE THE TASK MORE DIFFICULT, YOUR CHOPPER HAS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF FUEL. THROUGHOUT THE LANDSCAPES ARE FUEL TANKS; IF ONE OF THESE IS SHOT OR BOMBED, YOU WILL BE AWARDED EXTRA FUEL. AS THE LEVELS PROGRESS, THE ENEMIES BECOME MORE AGGRESSIVE, FUEL BECOMES MORE SCARCE, AND THE LANDSCAPE BECOMES TRICKIER TO NAVIGATE.</desc>

		<name>Take the Money and Run</name>
		<desc>AFTER A TIME TRAVEL, THE PLAYERS ARE TRAPPED IN THE LAND OF KEYNESIUM, IN 231,000 A.D. THE KEYNESIANS ARE DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE 20TH CENTURY ECONOMIC LIFE, AND THEY BUILD MORE THAN A TRILLION DIFFERENT MAZES POPULATED BY ROBOTS REPRESENTING THE ECONOMIC FACTORS OF THAT TIME. STARTING WITH $500,000, THE PLAYERS MUST TURN IT INTO A MILLION SO THEY CAN RETURN FOR THEIR TIME, OR ELSE BE DOOMED TO ROAM THE KEYNESIAN MAZES FOREVER!

IN THIS GAME, THE PLAYERS PLAY AGAINST THE KEYNESIAN ROBOTS IN SEVEN KINDS OF MAZES, CALLED INCOME, REWARD, INVESTMENT, EXPENSES, THIEF, TAXES AND INFLATION. IN THE FIRST THREE KINDS OF MAZES, THE PLAYER MUST TRY TO CATCH THE ROBOTS IN ORDER TO GAIN MONEY. IN THE LAST FOUR KINDS OF MAZES, THE PLAYERS MUST RUN FROM THE ROBOTS, AS THEY LOSE MONEY IF CAUGHT.

IN BOTH KINDS OF MAZES, A MONEY COUNTER WILL APPEAR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, SHOWING DIFFERENT VALUES OF MONEY EACH TIME A MAZE IS STARTED. THE COUNTER WILL START TO DECREASE AND THE PLAYERS WILL WIN (IF THEY CATCH THE ROBOTS IN THE THREE FIRST KINDS OF MAZES) OR LOSE (IF THEY ARE CAUGHT BY THE ROBOTS IN THE LAST FOUR KINDS OF MAZES) THE AMOUNT OF MONEY SHOWN.

THE PLAYERS' CHARACTERS ARE TWO TIMES TALLER THAN THE ROBOTS, THUS SOMETIMES THE PLAYERS MUST DUCK TO PASS THROUGH CERTAIN PORTIONS OF THE MAZES (BY PRESSING THE ACTION BUTTON). WHILE DUCKING THE PLAYERS MOVE AT 2/3 THE NORMAL SPEED. IF THEY TRY TO PASS THROUGH A LOW CEILING PORTION WITHOUT DUCKING, THEY'LL MOVE AT HALF THE SPEED. TOUCHING THE WALLS OF A MAZE WILL MAKE IT HARDER TO MOVE, AND TOUCHING THE OPPONENT PLAYER WHILE TOUCHING THE A WILL MAKE HIM LOSE CONTROL.</desc>

		<name>The Blobbers</name>
		<desc>IN BLOBBERS THE PLAYER CONTROLS A MOBILE LASER UNIT TRYING TO DEFEND ITSELF FROM THE BLOBBERS, FEARSOME, GIANT, AMOEBA-LIKE CREATURES THAT WILL DEVOUR ANYTHING THEY ENCOUNTER. THE MOBILE LASER UNIT MOVES GROUNDED TO THE SIDES OF THE SCREEN AREA. THE BLOBBERS WILL ALSO MOVE ALONG THE SAME SIDES, AND AS THE LASER GUN CAN ONLY SHOOT STRAIGHT FORWARD, THE MOBILE LASER UNIT HAS TO BE IN THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE SCREEN TO HIT THE BLOBBERS.

A BLOBBER BORNS AS A HARMLESS SMALL YELLOW SPOT, GROWING TO A BIGGER AND PURPLE MASS, TO A BIGGER AND WHITE ONE UNTIL IT REACHES ITS RED ADULT FORM. ONLY WHEN IT IS RED IT CAN DO HARM TO THE MOBILE LASER UNIT, IF THEY ARE OF ANY OTHER COLOR, THEY WILL ONLY STICK TO THE MOBILE LASER UNIT UNTIL IT MOVES AND RELEASES ITSELF FROM THE BLOBBER. AS THE TIME PASSES, AN ADULT BLOBBER WILL MULTIPLY, RELEASING A NEW SMALL YELLOW SPOT WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY GROW INTO ANOTHER ADULT BLOBBER. WHEN BLOBBERS ARE HIT, THEY ARE REDUCED TO THE IMMEDIATE PREVIOUS STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT (FROM RED TO WHITE, THEN PURPLE, THEN YELLOW, THEN DECEASED).

IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN, MOVING BLOCKS CALLED MAGIC TRANSPORTERS MOVE UP AND DOWN RANDOMLY. THEY ARE CALLED MAGIC TRANSPORTERS BECAUSE THEY CAN BE USED TO TRANSPORT THE MOBILE LASER UNIT FROM ONE SIDE OF THE SCREEN TO THE OTHER, IF THE MOBILE LASER UNIT MOVES ONTO ONE OF THEM WHILE THEY TOUCH THE TOP OR BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. THE BLOBBERS WILL ALSO BE TRANSPORTED BY THEM. ALSO, THEY ARE IMPENETRABLE BY THE LASER GUN, MEANING THE PLAYER WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO HIT ONE BLOBBER WHEN THERE ARE NO MAGIC TRANSPORTERS IN THE LASER'S WAY.

THE BLOBBERS WILL BECOME FASTER EVERY 90 SECONDS UNTIL FINALLY REACHING THE MOBILE LASER UNIT'S SPEED. THE PLAYER HAS ONLY ONE LIFE AND NO CONTINUES.</desc>

		<name>The Great Wall Street Fortune Hunt</name>
		<desc>THE GREAT WALL STREET FORTUNE HUNT IS ANOTHER GAME IN THE MASTER STRATEGY SERIES, A SERIES OF PART CONSOLE, PART BOARD GAMES ON THE ODYSSEY².

THIS IS A STOCK EXCHANGE SIMULATOR. ONE OR TWO PLAYERS (OR GROUPS, IF MORE THAN 2 PEOPLE ARE PLAYING) TAKE THE ROLE OF INVESTORS (OR INVESTMENT SYNDICATES) TRYING TO ANTICIPATE INVESTMENT FLUCTUATIONS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BUYING AND SELLING OPPORTUNITIES WHICH OCCURS DURING THE GAME.

THE MAIN SCREEN IS DIVIDED IN THREE SECTIONS. THE UPPER SECTION DISPLAYS THE INVESTMENT CHOICES AND PRICES PER SHARE SCROLLING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT. THE MIDDLE SECTION DISPLAYS NEWS FLASHES RELATED TO THE MARKET AND THE LOWER SECTION DISPLAYS EACH PLAYER'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND CAPITAL. A GREY BAR CHART TO THE RIGHT DISPLAYS THE OVERALL MARKET PERFORMANCE DURING EACH QUARTER OF A YEAR.

EACH INVESTOR STARTS WITH $100,000 AND CAN ENTER A MAXIMUM OF SEVEN INVESTMENTS INTO THE COMPUTER. THE INVESTMENTS ARE BOUGHT USING THE KEYBOARD BY ENTERING THE LETTERS REPRESENTING IT (IBM, FOR INSTANCE) AND THE NUMBER OF SHARES WANTED. THE SHARES CAN BE SOLD IN LOTS OF 100. ALL INVESTMENTS ENTERED MUST BE SOLD AT THE END OF EACH YEAR (FOUR QUARTERS, EACH QUARTER TAKING ABOUT 5 MINUTES OF REAL TIME). THE COMPUTER WILL SIGNAL THE END OF EACH QUARTER. THE WINNER IS THE INVESTOR ACCUMULATING THE GREATEST NET WORTH AFTER 5 YEARS.

THE GAME CAN BE PLAYED IN FOUR LEVELS OF PROGRESSIVELY INCREASED COMPLEXITY:
STRAIGHT INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
2. STRAIGHT INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS &amp; TREASURY BILLS
3. STRAIGHT INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS &amp; TREASURY BILLS &amp; BUYING ON MARGIN
4. STRAIGHT INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS &amp; TREASURY BILLS &amp; BUYING ON MARGIN &amp; STOCK OPTIONS

THE GAMEBOARD IS USED TO KEEP TRACK OF INFORMATION DEALT WITH OFF-SCREEN. IT IS DIVIDED IN 4 SECTIONS: INVESTMENT POSITIONS, T-BILL MARKET, TIME FRAME INDICATOR AND PRIME RATE INDICATOR.

EACH INVESTOR RECEIVES A SET OF NUMBERED SHARE/MARGIN TOKENS TO BE PLACED IN THE SHARE SECTION OF THE GAMEBOARD FOR EVERY STRAIGHT TRANSACTION DONE. THERE ARE 30 DIFFERENT INVESTMENTS AVAILABLE AND EACH INVESTMENT HAS A DIFFERENT SENSITIVITY TO CHANGING NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CONDITIONS IN THREE AREAS AS SHOWN IN THE GAMEBOARD: GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT, PRIME INTEREST RATE AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY. THE NEWS FLASHES PRESENTED IN THE SCREEN WILL AFFECT THE INVESTMENTS ACCORDING TO THERE THREE INDICATORS.

THE TIME FRAME INDICATOR IS USED TO KEEP TRACK OF WHICH QUARTER THE GAME IS CURRENTLY ON.

THE T-BILL MARKET AND PRIME INTEREST RATE PARTS OF THE GAMEBOARD ARE ONLY USED IN LEVEL 2 GAMES OR HIGHER. THE PRIME INTEREST RATE IS THE INTEREST BANKS QUOTE AS CHARGING THEIR BEST CORPORATE CUSTOMERS. IT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE INTEREST RATE ON TREASURY BILLS. THE PRIME RATE WILL BE REPORTED BY THE NEWS BULLETINS ON THE SCREEN AND MUST BE MARKED WITH THE APPROPRIATE TOKENS ON THE GAMEBOARD.

THE LEVEL 3 ADDS THE OPTION OF BUYING STOCKS ON MARGIN, I.E., WITH MONEY BORROWED FROM THE BROKER. THE COMPUTER ONLY KEEPS TRACK OF INVESTMENTS BOUGHT IN CASH, SO THIS KIND OF TRANSACTION MUST BE TRACKED WITH THE HELP OF A PROPER TOKEN IN THE GAMEBOARD.

THE LEVEL 4 ADDS OPTION TRADES TO THE GAME. OPTIONS GIVE THE INVESTOR THE RIGHT, BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION, TO BUY OR SELL SECURITIES AT CURRENT PRICES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FOLLOWING QUARTER. IT IS BASICALLY A BET ABOUT THE RISE OR FALL OF A SPECIFIC SECURITY PRICE.

BESIDES THE GAMEBOARD, EACH PLAYER HAS HIS/HER OWN INVESTMENT RECORD PAD TO BETTER KEEP TRACK OF HIS/HER TRANSACTIONS.</desc>

THE ONLY PLAYER TO SCORE IS THE MOUSE. HE DOES SO BY EATING THE CHEESE PIECES SCATTERED THROUGH THE ROOM. TO EAT, THE PLAYER CONTROLLING THE MOUSE HAS TO PRESS AND HOLD THE "ACTION" BUTTON. THE LONGER THE BUTTON STAY PRESSED, THE MORE IT EATS. IF THE MOUSE EATS FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME, IT WILL GROW BIGGER THAN THE CAT AND WILL BE IMMUNE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

THE CAT TRIES TO CATCH THE MOUSE BY BUILDING A TRAP AROUND IT. TO DO SO, THE PLAYER CONTROLLING THE CAT HAS TO MOVE THE CAT AROUND THE MOUSE WHILE PRESSING THE "ACTION" BUTTON. THE CAT HAS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TRAP PARTS TO USE AND THE USED ONES CAN BE PICKED UP AGAIN BY BEING WALKED OVER.

THE GAME HAS 7 SKILL LEVELS (WITH LESS TRAP PARTS FOR THE MOUSE AND BOTH CAT AND MOUSE MOVING FASTER THE HIGHER THE LEVEL IS) AND 8 POSSIBLE VARIATIONS (WITH STATIONARY AND MOVING CHEESE AND OBSTACLES FOR THE MOUSE).</desc>

IT TAKES PLACE IN A PACMAN-ESQUE LABYRINTH, WITH TURTLE BOXES IN THE CENTRE AND CORNERS OF THE SCREEN. RUN INTO A BOX TO RELEASE THE TURTLE KID INSIDE. OPENING A BOX MAKES A LITTLE HOUSE SHOW UP, AND YOU MUST GO WITH THE KIDTURTLE TO THE HOUSE BEFORE YOU CAN RELEASE THE NEXT ONE. ALL THE WHILE, YOU MUST AVOID THE BUGS/CARS RUNNING AROUND THE MAZE. IF THEY GET TOO CLOSE, YOU CAN RELEASE A MINE WHICH WILL STUN THEM TEMPORARILY. WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF MINES, YOU MUST RESUPPLY BY PASSING OVER A STAR IN THE CENTRE OF THE SCREEN. BEWARE, THOUGH, BECAUSE THE SIMPLEMINDED BUGS BECOME SMARTER AS TIME PASSES; THIS IS SYMBOLISED BY THEIR CHANGING COLOURS. ON LATER LEVELS, THOSE SNEAKY BEETLES CAN ALSO COME OUT OF THE BOXES SUPPOSED TO HOLD KIDTURTLES. WATCH OUT!

EACH LEVEL IS A FLOOR IN A HOUSE, AND BETWEEN LEVELS YOU CAN SEE THE TURTLE CLIMBING TO THE NEXT FLOOR UNTIL IT REACHES THE TOP.</desc>

		<desc>TYPE &amp; TELL! LETS THE PLAYER TYPE IN A WORD OR A MESSAGE AND THEN HAVE THE WORDS SPOKEN BACK TO THEM BY UTILIZING THE ODYSSEY 2'S VOICE MODULE. THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL SUGGESTS THE FOLLOWING GAMES THAT CAN BE PLAYED: GARBLE! - PLAYERS TAKE TURNS TYPING IN ONE LETTER AT A TIME, THE IDEA IS TO FORM SENTENCES BY JUST USING THE SOUNDS THE INDIVIDUAL LETTERS MAKE. SOUND WAVES! - PLAYERS TYPE IN RANDOM LETTERS TRYING TO CREATE SOUNDS THAT SOUND LIKE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE HEARD IN REAL LIFE. SUPER STAR! - PLAYERS CAN USE THE SOUNDS OR DIALOGUE THE GAME MAKES IN THEIR OWN HOME MOVIE OR RADIO SHOW. WAR OF WORDS! - THIS GAME REQUIRES AT LEAST TWO PLAYERS. PLAYER TAKE TURNS TYPING IN WORDS UNTIL A SENTENCE IS CREATED BY ONE OF THE PLAYERS ADDING A PERIOD. PLAYERS THEN TAKE TURNS INSERTING WORDS INTO THE SENTENCE, WHILE TRYING TO KEEP IT GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT. THE FIRST PLAYER TO EXTEND THE SENTENCE EXACTLY TO THE END OF THE AVAILABLE TYPING SPACE IS THE WINNER. IF A PLAYER EXTENDS THE SENTENCE BEYOND THE END OF THAT AVAILABLE SPACE, THEY LOSE.</desc>

		<desc>DESCRIPTION

COMMANDING OF ONE OF EARTH FEDERATION'S ROBOT-CONTROLLED BATTLE CRUISERS, THE PLAYER MUST PROTECT EARTH FROM AN INVASION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS.

THE SHIP IS EQUIPPED WITH A LASER CANNON AND A FORCE FIELD. THE FORCE FIELD ENERGY IS DRAINED WHEN THE SHIP'S LASERS ARE FIRED (BY PRESSING THE ACTION BUTTON). THE DIRECTION OF THE LASERS IS SHOWN BY A WHITE DOT IN THE FORCE FIELD, WHICH ROTATES TO AIM IN THE DIRECTION THE SHIP IS MOVING.

THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF UFO'S. THE FIRST ONE DRIFTS RANDOMLY IN SPACE. THE SECOND, THE HUNTER-KILLER, CAN DETECT THE PLAYER'S SPACESHIP, LINKING WITH ANOTHER ONE OF THE SAME TYPE WHEN IT HAPPENS. THE THIRD ONE IS A LIGHT-SPEED STARSHIP ARMED WITH COMPUTER-GUIDED MISSILES.

THE UFO'S CAN BE DESTROYED BY LASER BLASTS OR BY ENTERING IN TOUCH WITH THE FORCE FIELD IN THE PLAYER'S SHIP. IF THE LATER HAPPENS, THE FORCE FIELD ENERGY IS ALSO DRAINED.

THE SHIP TRAVELS AT HALF-SPEED WHEN ITS FORCE FIELD IS RECHARGING. IT GOES FROM BLACK (WHEN DEPLETED) TO BLUE (WHEN FULLY CHARGED). THE SHIP IS VULNERABLE UNTIL THE FORCE FIELD IS COMPLETELY RECHARGED.

THE PLAYER WILL EARN 1 POINT FOR EACH RANDOM DRIFTER DESTROYED, 3 POINTS FOR EACH HUNTER-KILLER AND 10 POINTS FOR EACH LIGHT-SPEED STARSHIP.</desc>
