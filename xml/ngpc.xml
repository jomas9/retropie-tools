THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO COLOR THE ENTIRE MAZE-LIKE PLAYING FIELD WITH A PAINT BRUSH. WHILE YOU PAINT, TWO ENEMIES WALK AROUND IN THE MAZE, WHEN THEY HIT YOU, YOU LOSE A LIFE.

A LEVEL HAS ROLLERS WHICH YOU CAN PUSH FORWARD WITH YOUR PAINT BRUSH. IF YOU CAPTURE AN ENEMY IN THE PATH OF THE ROLLER HE DIES AND IS TEMPORARILY TAKEN OUT OF THE GAME. THIS SCORES YOU EXTRA POINTS. EACH SUBSEQUENT ENEMY ROLLED OVER IS WORTH MORE POINTS.

EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE ANOTHER CREATURE WILL POP UP, IT WILL RUN AROUND LEAVING BEHIND TRACK MARKS IN YOUR PAINT. PAINTING OVER THIS CREATURE REMOVES IT FROM THE GAME AND SCORES YOU ADDITIONAL POINTS. HIS TRACKS HAVE TO BE REPAINTED.

WHEN THE ENTIRE MAZE IS PAINTED YOU WIN THE LEVEL. UNLIKE THE ORIGINAL ARCADE VERSION THE NEO GEO POCKET COLOR VERSION HAS MULTIPLE LEVELS.</desc>

		<desc>ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR AND INFLUENTIAL GAMES OF THE 1980'S, PAC-MAN STARS A LITTLE, YELLOW DOT-MUNCHER WHO WORKS HIS WAY AROUND TO CLEAR A MAZE OF THE VARIOUS DOTS AND FRUIT WHICH INHABIT THE BOARD.

PAC-MAN'S GOAL IS CONTINUALLY CHALLENGED BY FOUR GHOSTS: THE SHY BLUE GHOST BASHFUL (INKY), THE TRAILING RED GHOST SHADOW (BLINKY), THE FAST PINK GHOST SPEEDY (PINKY), AND THE FORGETFUL ORANGE GHOST POKEY (CLYDE).  ONE TOUCH FROM ANY OF THESE GHOSTS MEANS A LOSS OF LIFE FOR PAC-MAN.

PAC-MAN CAN TURN THE TABLES ON HIS PURSUERS BY EATING OF THE FOUR ENERGIZERS LOCATED WITHIN THE MAZE.  DURING THIS TIME, THE GHOSTS TURN BLUE, AND PAC-MAN CAN EAT THEM FOR BONUS POINTS.  THIS ONLY LASTS FOR A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME, AS THE GHOST'S EYES FLOAT BACK TO THEIR CENTER BOX, AND REGENERATE TO CHASE AFTER PAC-MAN AGAIN.

SURVIVE A FEW ROUNDS OF GAMEPLAY, AND BE TREATED TO HUMOROUS INTERMISSIONS BETWEEN PAC-MAN AND THE GHOSTS.</desc>

		<name>Picture Puzzle</name>
		<desc>PICTURE PUZZLE (OEKAKI PUZZLE IN JAPAN) IS A PAINT-BY-NUMBERS PUZZLE GAME DEVELOPED BY SUCCESS FOR THE NEO GEO POCKET COLOR. THE GAME PLAYS IDENTICAL TO NINTENDO'S PICROSS SERIES. PICTURE PUZZLE OFFERS A TOTAL OF 200 PUZZLES: 20 5X5 PUZZLES, 105 10X10'S, AND 75 15X15'S. THIS IS BIASED TOWARDS SMALLER PUZZLES BECAUSE THE GRIDS IN ANYTHING LARGER WOULD BE INCREDIBLY TINY ON THE NGPC'S SCREEN. ALSO, LARGER PUZZLES TAKE MUCH LONGER TO SOLVE; SMALLER PUZZLES ALLOWS YOU TO PICK UP THE POCKET FOR 10-20 MINUTES AT A TIME AND, ON A GOOD DAY, SOLVE A COMPLETE PUZZLE.

UPON COMPLETION OF A PUZZLE, THE GAME REPLACES IT WITH A COLORED VERSION OF THE SAME GRID AND GIVES IT A TITLE. ESPECIALLY WITH THE SMALLER PUZZLES, THIS IS HELPFUL IN THAT IT IS SOMETIMES OTHERWISE UNCLEAR AS TO WHAT EXACTLY THE COMPLETED PICTURE IS SUPPOSED TO BE. BECAUSE IT COLORIZES THEM, THE GAME REQUIRES THE NEO GEO POCKET COLOR, I.E, IT WON'T RUN ON A MONOCHROME NEO GEO POCKET.</desc>
