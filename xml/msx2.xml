		<name>Akumajyo Drakyula</name>
		<desc>YOU ARE YOUNG SIMON, WHO HAS JUST ENTERED DRACULA'S SATANIC CASTLE.
THE WORLD OF DRANSYLVANIA IS IN TROUBLE, AND YOU ARE THE ONE TO SET IT RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO FIGHT YOUR WAY THROUGH 18 STAGES OF DEMONS TO WHERE DRACULA IS HIDING. ONCE YOU HAVE DESTROYED DRACULA, THE EVIL FORCE BEHIND ALL THE TROUBLE WILL SHOW UP, ATTEMPTING TO DESTROY YOU! DESTROY THIS MENACE, AND DRANSYLVANIA WILL RETURN TO IT'S HAPPY DAYS AFTER A WAIT OF HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

VAMPIRE KILLER FOLLOWS THE SAME PLOT AS CASTLEVANIA, BUT WITH A DIFFERENT GAMEPLAY. AT EACH STAGE, SIMON HAS TO FIND A WHITE KEY TO OPEN THE EXIT DOOR WHICH LEADS TO THE NEXT STAGE. THE KEYS ARE USUALLY HIDDEN IN THE CASTLE'S WALLS, IN WHICH HE WILL ALSO FIND USEFUL ITEMS. ITEMS CAN ALSO BE FOUND BY WHIPPING CANDLES AND OTHER SOURCES OF LIGHT INSIDE THE CASTLE.

AMONG THE ITEMS WHICH CAN BE FOUND ARE:
GOLD CROSS: WIPES OUT ALL ENEMIES;
SILVER CROSS: PREVENT ENEMIES FROM APPEARING FOR A SHORT TIME;
SAPPHIRE RING: RENDERS SIMON INVINCIBLE FOR A SHORT TIME;
BLUE CRYSTAL: RENDERS SIMON INVISIBLE FOR A SHORT TIME;
YELLOW KEY: IS USED TO OPEN CHESTS CONTAINING ITEMS;
CANDLE: HIGHLIGHTS DESTRUCTIBLE WALLS; 
MAP: CAN BE USED UP TO THREE TIMES AND SHOWS SIMON LOCATION N THE CASTLE;
RED BOOK: INCREASES ITEM'S PRICES;
WHITE BOOK: DECREASES ITEM'S PRICES
TAN SHIELD: BLOCKS ENEMY ATTACKS;
RED SHIELD: REDUCES DAMAGE UPON ENEMY CONTACT;
BOOTS: MAKE SIMON WALK FASTER;
WINGS: MAKE SIMON JUMP HIGHER;
HOLY WATER: A SECONDARY WEAPON, WHICH USES HEARTS AS AMMUNITION;
HOURGLASS: STOPS ENEMY MOVEMENT FOR A SHORT TIME, CONSUMING HEARTS.
HEARTS ARE BOTH A KIND OF AMMUNITION AND CURRENCY IN THE GAME. THEY CAN BE FOUND BY WHIPPING CANDLES OR KILLING ENEMIES. THEY ARE USED FOR BUYING ITEMS FROM THE OLD CRONE AND AS AMMO FOR THE HOLY WATER AND THE HOURGLASS.

SIMON CAN ALSO FIND SEVERAL PRIMARY WEAPONS IN THE GAME, SUCH AS WHIP UPGRADES, A THROWING DAGGER, AN AXE AND A CROSS. DIFFERENTLY FROM CASTLEVANIA, THE DAGGER, AXE AND CROSS REPLACE THE WHIP AND DO NOT USE HEARTS AS AMMO.</desc>

UNLIKE ALESTE 1, YOU ARE NOT CONTROLLING A SPACESHIP, BUT INSTEAD YOU'RE CONTROLLING A ROBOT. HOWEVER, LIKE ALESTE, YOU CAN SHOOT ENEMIES, ENEMIES CAN SHOOT YOU, COLLECT POWER UPS, AND DEFEAT BOSSES AT THE END OF A LEVEL. HOWEVER, NEW TO THIS GAME IS THE ABILITY TO JUMP OVER HOLES IN THE GROUND. THIS ADDS A NEW CHALLENGE TO THE GAME. IN SOME LEVELS, THERE ARE EVEN OBSTACLES LIKE CARS THAT YOU HAVE TO AVOID. POWER UPS RANGE FROM ONE THAT CLONES YOURSELF AND CAN FIRE LASERS WITH YOU, ONE THAT REPLACES YOUR DEFAULT LASER WITH SHURIKENS. ONE REPLACES YOUR DEFAULT WEAPON AND INSTEAD SHOOTS RED TARGETS THAT GO IN A ZIG-ZAG. THIS LASER HAS A POSSIBLITY OF SHOOTING ENEMIES. THE KINDS OF POWER-UPS ARE MARKED BY THE COLOR OF THEIR BOX-CONTAINERS AND THE JAPANESE LETTER ON THEM.</desc>

		<desc>IN OUR UNIVERSE MATTER AND ANTI-MATTER CO-EXIST WITH EACH OTHER. HOWEVER, PREVALENCE OF ANTI-MATTER MAY CREATE CHAOS AND EVENTUALLY DISRUPT THE NORMAL FLOW OF THINGS. IN A CORNER OF A UNIVERSE, A CONCENTRATION OF ANTI-MATTER LED TO THE CREATION OF AN ENTIRE STAR, BREEDING FORMS OF LIFE THREATENING TO DESTROY THE WORLD. HUMAN BEINGS, IN AN EFFORT TO SAVE THE UNIVERSE, CREATED THE POWERFUL ANDOROGYNUS - A LIFE FORM CAPABLE OF BEING MALE AND FEMALE AT ONCE - AND SENT IT ON A MISSION TO DESTROY THE CREATION OF ANTI-MATTER.

ANDOROGYNUS (SIC) IS A TOP-DOWN SHOOT-EM-UP. THE PLAYER CONTROLS THE TITULAR HERO(INE), SHOOTING AT CONSTANTLY ATTACKING ENEMIES. UNLIKE IN MOST GAMES OF THE TYPE, THE SCREEN SCROLLS DOWN RATHER THAN UP. THE PROTAGONIST IS EQUIPPED WITH A DEFAULT SINGLE SHOT AND HAS PROTECTIVE ORBS REVOLVING AROUND THAT DAMAGE NEARBY ENEMIES. THE WEAPON CAN BE ENHANCED (RAPID FIRE, THREE-WAY FIRE, ETC.) BY COLLECTING RANDOMLY DESCENDING POWER-UPS. THE PLAYER CONTROLS THE MALE INCARNATION OF THE PROTAGONIST INITIALLY, BUT LATER SWITCHES TO THE FEMALE ONE.</desc>

		<name>Arctic</name>
		<desc>ARCTIC IS AN ACTION PUZZLE GAME THAT DESCRIBES ITSELF AS "ACTIVE RAIL PLAYING". EACH OF MORE THAN TWO-DOZEN STAGES CONSISTS OF A SET OF RAILS IN VARIOUS ARRANGEMENTS, OFTEN LOOPING AROUND EACH OTHER AND SPLITTING IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS. EACH STAGE CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COLORED BALLS WHICH BEGIN IN CORRESPONDING SLOTS, AND AFTER LAUNCHING THEM THE GOAL IS TO RETURN THE BALLS TO THE MATCHING-COLORED SLOTS. THE ONLY INTERACTION THE PLAYER HAS WITH THE BOARD IS SWITCHING TWO SETS OF SPLITS; THERE ARE YELLOW AND BLUE SPLITS, WHICH WILL REDIRECT ANY BALLS MOVING THROUGH THEM, AND THE PLAYER CAN ONLY TURN ALL OF ONE COLOR AS A GROUP. MANY STAGES ALSO CONTAIN BUMPERS AND GATES WHICH WILL AFFECT THE SPEED AND DIRECTION OF THE BALLS. COMPLETING A PUZZLE OFTEN REQUIRES STRATEGIC USE OF THE STAGE'S FEATURES TO BOUNCE BALLS ONTO THE CORRECT PATHS.</desc>

BUBBLE BOBBLE IS A PLATFORM GAME, WITH EACH LEVEL BEING A SINGLE SCREEN. THE ENEMIES MUST BE CLEARED FROM A LEVEL TO GO TO THE NEXT ONE. WITH ONE PLAYER CONTROLLING BUB AND THE OTHER CONTROLLING BOB, THE PLAYER CAN JUMP AND COLLECT ITEMS FOR POINTS (SUCH AS FRUIT). THE REAL POWER BUB AND BOB HAVE HOWEVER IS THE ABILITY TO BLOW BUBBLES. THESE BUBBLES CAN BE AS PLATFORMS TO LEAP ON, OR TO TRAP ENEMIES. ENEMIES TRAPPED IN A BUBBLE MUST BE POPPED BY JUMPING INTO THEM, WHEREIN THEY'LL TURN TO FRUIT. ADDITIONALLY, POWER-UPS SOMETIMES FLOAT BY IN BUBBLES. THEY INCLUDE LIGHTNING, WHICH FLIES OUT HORIZONTALLY AT ENEMIES, AND WATER, WHICH DRAGS THE PLAYER AND ENEMIES STRAIGHT DOWN FLOWING OVER PLATFORMS. TAKING TOO LONG TO COMPLETE ANY LEVEL WILL SUMMON BARON VON BLUBBA, WHO WILL FLOAT AROUND THE SCREEN TRYING TO DESTROY THE PLAYER.</desc>

		<desc>THE GAME TAKES PLACE WITHIN A GIGANTIC SPACESHIP WHICH HAS VIRTUALLY INFINITE CAPACITY BECAUSE OF ITS ABILITY TO MANIPULATE TIME AND SPACE. THE PLAYER MUST DEAL WITH ENIGMATIC CREATURES CALLED EVOL, WHICH CONSIST ONLY OF PURE ENERGY AND NEED TO KEEP THEMSELVES IN CAPSULES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEIR EXISTENCE IN THE WORLD.
ALL OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE GAME ARE DESIGNED TO RESEMBLE MICROSCOPIC ORGANISMS, BOTH IN THEIR APPEARANCE AND THEIR QUICK, TRICKY MOVEMENTS. THE PLAYER'S SHIP UNDERGOES OVER 10 TYPES OF TRANSFORMATIONS THROUGHOUT THE GAME, EACH WITH OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE MANEUVERS SPECIFIC TO THEIR DESIGN. THE SOUND EFFECTS USED ARE MINIMAL, BUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOUNDS ARE USED ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF SHOTS OR THEIR SPEED. A SOUND RESEMBLING A LONG SCREAM RESULTS WHEN THE PLAYER'S SHIP IS HIT AND RETURNS TO ITS WEAKEST EVOLUTIONARY STATE. THE GAME'S DESIGNER, GRAPHIC DESIGNER, AND MUSIC COMPOSER, TOMO FURUKAWA, WOULD GO ON TO BECOME THE VOCALIST OF THE BAND GUNIW TOOLS.THE GAME CONTROLS LIKE A REGULAR SHOOT-'EM-UP: A AND C SHOOT BULLETS, B DROPS BOMBS; THERE IS RAPIDFIRE. HOWEVER, UNLIKE REGULAR SHOOT-'EM-UPS WHERE WEAPONS ARE UPGRADED THROUGH POWERUPS, YOUR SHIP "EVOLVES" TO SURVIVE SITUATIONS AND GET PAST OBSTACLES. EVOLUTION OCCURS WITH THE EVOL (SMALL FACES WITH AN E ON THEM) AND B-EVOL (DARKER EVOLS). EACH PICKUP ADDS A NEW EVOLUTION STATE TO THE LIST. AFTER A PARTICULAR AMOUNT OF TIME, ONE EVOLUTION WEARS OFF AND THE NEXT EVOLUTION IS CHOSEN. THE DNA POWERUP DOES PROVIDE A MORE PERMANENT WEAPON UPGRADE, BUT WILL MERELY JUST MAKE THE EXISTING WEAPONS STRONGER. YOU CAN HOLD UP TO NINE DNA POWERUPS.</desc>

THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO ENTER THE LARGE DUNGEON, ITSELF DIVIDED INTO 5 AREAS, COLLECTING A VARIETY OF ITEMS (WHICH AS MENTIONED, CAN ONLY BE USED BY PARTICULAR CHARACTERS) AND USE THEM TO PROGRESS THROUGH THE DUNGEON, DEFEATING MONSTERS. POWER-UPS DROPPED BY MONSTERS INCLUDE GOLD, KEYS, HEALTH-RESTORING BREAD, MAGIC-RESTORING POTIONS AND HEALTH-DAMAGING POISON. GOLD CAN BE SPENT ON ITEMS AND OTHER POWER-UPS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AT VARIOUS SHOPS HIDDEN INSIDE THE DUNGEON.

		<desc>DRUID IS AN ACTION GAME INSPIRED BY THE ARCADE HIT GAUNTLET. AS THE EPONYMOUS HERO, YOUR JOB IS TO DESTROY FOUR MAGIC SKULLS HIDDEN OVER EIGHT LEVELS. 

THE GAME IS PRESENTED IN A TOP-DOWN VIEW. THE DRUID WALKS AROUND THE TERRAIN SEEKING OUT THE STAIRCASE THAT LEADS TO THE NEXT LEVEL. ON THE WAY, HE IS HARASSED BY HORDES OF MONSTERS THAT COME OUT OF EVERY DIRECTION AND ATTACK HIM, DECREASING HIS HEALTH. TO DEFEND HIMSELF, THE DRUID CAN USE THE SPELLS OF WATER, FIRE OR ELECTRICITY TO TOSS PROJECTILES. HOWEVER, THESE MAGICAL WEAPONS HAVE LIMITED AMMO. 

THE DRUID ALSO HAS THREE OTHER MAGICAL SPELLS AT HIS DISPOSAL - AN INVISIBILITY SPELL WHICH PREVENTS THE MONSTERS FROM AUTOMATICALLY APPROACHING HIM, A GOLEM SPELL WHICH SUMMONS A HELPFUL GOLEM (WHICH CAN BE CONTROLLED BY A SECOND PLAYER), AND A SKULL SPELL WHICH DESTROYS ALL ON-SCREEN ENEMIES. THE DRUID ALSO CARRIES AROUND KEYS WHICH OPEN LOCKED DOORS. BUT ALL THESE HAVE VERY LIMITED SUPPLIES. 

ON HIS WAY, THE DRUID FINDS MANY SHOPS. EACH SUCH SHOP CONTAINS SOME KEYS OR CHARGES FOR THE DRUID'S SPELLS, BUT THE DRUID CAN ONLY PICK ONE ITEM FROM EACH SHOP. 

THE DRUID CAN ALSO COME ACROSS A PENTAGRAM ON THE GROUND WHICH WILL RESTORE HIS LOST HEALTH.</desc>

EACH PUNCH WEAKENS YOUR OPPONENT'S STRENGTH WHICH CAN SLIGHTLY RECOVER DURING A ROUND BREAK. A RAIN OF WELL PLACED BLOWS CAN PRODUCE A QUICK KNOCKOUT, BUT NORMALLY YOU MUST HIT YOUR OPPONENT MANY TIMES BEFORE HE GOES DOWN.

THE GAME HAS THREE PLAY MODES. THERE IS TRAINING MODE TO TRAIN YOUR PLAYER BEFORE YOU ENTER A TOURNAMENT. A RANKING MODE WHERE YOU CAN SELECT ONE OF THE THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS, ROOKIE, JAPAN AND WORLD. EACH CHAMPIONSHIP CAN BE PLAYED AT FIVE DIFFICULTY LEVELS. THE THIRD MODE IS THE TOURNAMENT MODE. TO REACH THE NUMBER ONE SPOT IN THE RANKING OR TOURNAMENT MODE YOU MUST TRAIN YOUR BOXER WELL.

BEFORE YOU START YOU MUST CREATE YOUR CHARACTER AND SET HIS INITIAL ABILITIES, STRENGTH, SPEED AND STAMINA. EACH WON BOUT INCREASES THESE ABILITIES SLIGHTLY. THE ABILITIES OF YOUR OPPONENT AND YOU ARE VISIBLE IN THE STATUS BAR AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN DURING THE GAME. STRENGTH IS REPRESENTED WITH A BOXING GLOVE, SPEED WITH A SHOE AND STAMINA WITH A DUMB BELL.

THIS GAME CAN BE PLAYED BY ONE PLAYER AGAINST THE COMPUTER OR BY TWO PLAYERS AGAINST EACH OTHER. A PASSWORD IS GIVEN AFTER EACH WON BOUT AND IT ENABLES YOU TO CONTINUE WITH THE NEXT MATCH IN A TOURNAMENT AT A LATER TIME.</desc>

		<name>Fantasy Zone II - The Tears of Opa-Opa</name>
		<desc>IN THE PAST, THE COURAGEOUS HERO OPA-OPA SAVED THE FANTASY ZONE FROM THE INVADING NENON FORCES, BUT HIS VICTORY CAME AT A PRICE AS HE WAS FORCED TO FIGHT HIS OWN FATHER WHO LED THE INVASION. IT IS NOW SPACE YEAR 1432, 10 YEARS AFTER THAT BATTLE, AND THE NENON FORCES ARE ONCE AGAIN SPREADING CHAOS THROUGH THE FANTASY ZONE. OPA-OPA MUST ONCE AGAIN FLY INTO THE FANTASY ZONE TO ROUT THE INVASION. SIMILAR TO DEFENDER, THE PLAYER OCCUPIES A SIDE-SCROLLING LEVEL THAT REPEATS INDEFINITELY, AND IN WHICH THE PLAYER CAN FREELY TRAVEL LEFT OR RIGHT. EACH ZONE CONTAINS SEVERAL "BASES" THAT SERVE AS PRIMARY TARGETS. NEW TO THE SEQUEL ARE "WARPS" HIDDEN BEHIND CERTAIN BASES THAT ALLOW THE PLAYER TO TRAVEL BETWEEN DIFFERENT ZONES. EACH LEVEL HAS AT LEAST THREE ZONES, AND WHEN ALL OF THE BASES HAVE BEEN CLEARED IN ALL OF THE ZONES OF A LEVEL, THE PLAYER CAN TRAVEL THROUGH THE WARP TO THE BOSS. BOSS FIGHTS DO NOT ALLOW FOR FREE TRAVEL AS THE MAIN STAGES DO, AND FORCE THE PLAYER TO FACE THE BOSS OR FACE A PARTICULAR DIRECTION. BOSSES ARE GENERALLY VERY LARGE AND CHANGE COLOR TO REFLECT DAMAGE TAKEN. THE FINAL STAGE IS A "BOSS RUSH" IN WHICH THE PLAYER MUST FIGHT A SUCCESSION OF PREVIOUS BOSSES BEFORE FIGHTING THE FINAL BOSS. THERE ARE TWO ACTION BUTTONS THAT CORRESPOND TO TWO TYPES OF ATTACKS, "FIRE" AND "BOMB". THE FIRE ATTACKS SHOOT HORIZONTALLY, AS IN A TYPICAL SHOOTER, AND DIFFERENT VARIANTS CAN BE PURCHASED AT SHOPS. THE BOMB ATTACKS ARE MORE POWERFUL, AND THE BASIC BOMB DROPS DOWNWARD. OTHER VARIANTS HAVE OTHER BEHAVIORS AND ARE LIMITED IN QUANTITY. SHOPS, UNCOVERED AT KEY POINTS, ALLOW THE PLAYER TO PURCHASE UPGRADED WEAPONS, BOMBS, AND SPEED, AS WELL AS EXTRA LIVES.[8] UPGRADES TO OPA-OPA'S SPEED (SUCH AS LARGER WINGS, OR JET ENGINES) ARE PERMANENT AS LONG AS THE PLAYER DOES NOT LOSE A LIFE, BUT WEAPON UPGRADES ARE TIME-LIMITED, AND BOMBS LIMITED IN QUANTITY. ITEMS BECOME INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE WITH SUBSEQUENT PURCHASES, ENCOURAGING THE PLAYER TO VARY THEIR PURCHASES.</desc>

IN COMBAT, THE PROTAGONIST USES MELEE OR LONG-RANGED WEAPONS OR CASTS MAGIC SPELLS. UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS GAMES IN THE SERIES, THE PLAYER IS REQUIRED TO PRESS THE ATTACK BUTTON DURING MELEE COMBAT, INSTEAD OF SIMPLY "BUMPING" INTO THE ENEMIES. THERE IS AN INTERNAL CLOCK IN THE GAME, WHICH MAKES IT NECESSARY FOR THE PROTAGONIST TO SLEEP PERIODICALLY AND REGAIN HIS STRENGTH. THE MAIN CHARACTER ALSO HAS TO EAT FROM TIME TO TIME, OTHERWISE HIS HIT POINTS WILL GRADUALLY DECREASE. THE MORALITY SYSTEM FROM THE PREVIOUS GAME RETURNS: KILLING FRIENDLY CREATURES WILL REDUCE THE PLAYER'S MORALITY LEVEL, WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE AN EFFECT ON ONE OF THE GAME'S MOST DECISIVE BATTLES.</desc>

THE ANCIENTS ABANDONED THE PLANET, LEAVING BEHIND MANY DIFFERENT ARTIFACTS AND SHIPS, WHICH YOU CAN LOOT. SEND YOUR DROID TO RETRIEVE MODULES AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE ANCIENT TECHNOLOGY IS FOR. IT COULD BE BATTERIES, SHIELDS OR EVEN WEAPONS, TO HELP YOU FIGHT THE TRIGGER-HAPPY SAUCERS THAT WANT YOU DEAD.

THE GAME USES FRACTAL GRAPHICS, THE TERRAIN IS VAST AND DETAILED, AND THE STORY BEHIND IT IS QUITE COMPLEX, CONSIDERING THE TYPE OF GAME.</desc>

THERE ARE TWO TASKS ALTERNATING THROUGH LEVELS: YOU ARE REQUIRED EITHER TO KILL EVERY ENEMY IN THE LEVEL (AS IN THE PREVIOUS GAMES) OR SIMPLY TO REACH THE EXIT. RUNNING INTO ENEMIES USUALLY WONÂT KILL YOU, HOWEVER IF YOU ARE HIT BY A SINGLE PROJECTILE, YOUÂLL HAVE TO START FROM A CHECKPOINT. ENEMIES VARY FROM PLAIN NINJAS TO GIANT SKELETONS OR KILLER FISH. EACH LEVEL HAS A TIME LIMIT, AND WHEN THIS LIMIT IS CLOSE TO AN END A FIRE WHEEL OF DEATH WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN, CHASING NINJA-KUN.

NINJA-KUN HAS SOME TECHNIQUES FOR SUCCESSFUL PROGRESSION THOUGH THE LEVELS: MANY ENEMIES CAN BE TEMPORARILY STUNNED BY JUMPING ON THEM OR HITTING THEM FROM BELOW; AND NINJA CAN OBTAIN SOME POWER-UPS INCLUDING BOOMERANG, BOMBS, A DEVASTATING FIRE ATTACK OR INVINCIBILITY. NINJA-KUN IS CAPABLE OF WALL CLIMBING AND WALL JUMPING, THE LATTER REQUIRING SOME PRACTICE FROM THE PLAYER.

THE LEVELS (CALLED ÂSCENESÂ IN-GAME) ARE SCATTERED THROUGH MOUNTAINS, CAVES, BEACHES AND UNDERWATER LOCATIONS. YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH SET OF LEVELS YOUÂLL START IN BY PLAYING A MINI-GAME AT THE BEGINNING.</desc>

		<desc>IT IS THE 22ND CENTURY. EARTH IS INVADED BY A ALIENS, LED BY A GIGANTIC ROBOTIC SNAKE. TO REPEL THE ATTACK, EARTH'S SCIENTISTS CONSTRUCT THE REPLICART MACHINE, A DEADLY ROBOT SNAKE. THE PLAYER TAKES THE ROLE OF THE PILOT OF THE REPLICART.

REPLICART IS A SINGLE-PLAYER ONLY SNAKE GAME VARIANT. IN EACH OF THE 300 STAGES YOU HAVE TO COLLECT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF A SUBSTANCE CALLED 'BITESLIME'. ONCE YOU FULFILL YOUR QUOTA YOU CAN ENTER THE NEXT STAGE THROUGH AN EXIT THAT OPENS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN. COLLECTING BITESLIME INCREASES THE LENGTH OF YOUR SNAKE. IF THE HEAD OF YOUR SNAKE HITS A WALL, AN ENEMY OR PART OF ITS BODY YOU LOSE A LIFE.  REPLICART ENHANCES THE BASIC SNAKE GAME FORMULA BY ADDING POWER UPS LIKE A TIME STOP, WHICH FREEZES ENEMIES, SPEED INCREASE/DECREASE OR LEVEL WARPS.

THE FAMICOM DISK SYSTEM VERSION HAS UNDERGONE A FEW CHANGES. THERE ARE ONLY 100 STAGES AND AFTER EACH 10 STAGES YOU HAVE TO FACE A BOSS, WHICH MUST BE SHOT DOWN BEFORE CONTINUING TO THE NEXT SET OF STAGES.</desc>

THE GAME IS BROKEN UP INTO FOUR ZONES THAT ARE COMPOSED OF EIGHT AREAS EACH. IN EACH AREA PLAYERS HAVE TO COLLECT ALL THE VISIBLE ITEMS LAYING AROUND TO COMPLETE THAT AREA. ONCE ALL THE ITEMS ARE COLLECTED IN THE SEVEN AREAS OF A ZONE, PLAYERS CAN THEN ENTER THE EIGHTH AREA WHERE THEY WILL FIND ONE OF THEIR BANDMATES LOCKED INSIDE A CAGE. WHILE COLLECTING ALL THE VISIBLE ITEMS, PLAYERS WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY ATTACKED BY ENEMIES THAT THEY CAN EITHER TRY TO JUMP AND DODGE OR SHOOT THEIR PROJECTILE WEAPON AT THEM. GETTING HIT BY AN ENEMY WILL DECREASE THE PLAYERS LIFE, WHICH IS ALREADY CONSTANTLY DRAINING.

ONE OF THE ITEMS THE PLAYER COLLECTS ARE MONEYBAGS. COLLECTED MONEYBAGS EARN THE PLAYER MONEY WHICH CAN IN TURN BE SPENT AT THE VARIOUS SHOPS FOUND THROUGHOUT THE GAME. SHOPS SELL LIFE POTIONS, STRONGER WEAPONS, AND ALSO MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS FOR EACH BAND MEMBER.</desc>

PLAYS OUT PRETTY MUCH LIKE A BONKERS LIVE ACTION ANIME MOVIE. ITS A CAMP SCIENCE FICTION FANTASY COMEDY ABOUT A GIRL WHOSE SECRETLY THE LONE FIGHTER OF JUSTICE STAR VIRGIN, ITS HER PURSUIT TO STOP THE PLANET BEING ATTACKED FROM ROBOTIC &amp; PUPPET MONSTERS, GIANT SPIDERS AND WHATEVER ELSE WOULD WARRANT AS BEING AN END OF LEVEL BOSS IN AN 80S VIDEO GAME... AT LEAST I THINK THATS THE OVERALL IDEA, BECAUSE ITS OBVIOUSLY NEVER BEEN TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH ITS HARD TO TOTALLY FATHOM OUT WHAT THE HELLS GOING ON, BUT HEY THATS THE BEAUTY OF THE JAPANESE MOVIES RIGHT.

STAR VIRGIN HERSELF IS EVERY JAPANORAMA FANBOYS WETDREAM, SHES A CUTE PINK POWER RANGER WITH HER OWN SPACECRAFT &amp; POWERBIKE AND SHE KICKS ASS WITH A BAZOOKA. THE WHOLE THING WOULD HAVE MADE AN AWESOME MUSIC VIDEO FOR THE FLAMING LIPS - YOSHIMI BATTLES THE PINK ROBOTS (WHAT I'M ODDLY PLAYING WHILE WRITING THIS). SURE ITS NONE ESSENTIAL THROWAWAY STUFF, BUT ITS A FUN HOUR EVEN WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

[PERSONAL REASONS FOR REMEMBERING]
REALLY LOVED THE SPACECRAFT SCENES COMPLETE WITH THEIR ROBOTIC BUTLER DRIVERS AND ITS NOT EVERY DAY I GET TO SEE A MOVIE FEATURING A ROBOTIC STATUE OF LIBERTY AND AN EVIL GENIUS WHO LIVES ON A FLOATING VOLCANIC ISLAND.</desc>

		<desc>SUPER DAISENRYAKU IS ONE OF THE MANY TITLES IN SYSTEMSOFT'S LONG-RUNNING WAR STRATEGY SERIES. THE GAME MECHANICS ARE BASED ON DAISENRYAKU II, BUT MANY OF THE INCLUDED MAPS ARE UNIQUE TO THIS RELEASE, INCLUDING SEVERAL BASED ON PHANTASY STAR IN SEGA'S CONSOLE VERSION. THERE IS NO CAMPAIGN MODE, AND ANY OF THE INCLUDED MAPS CAN BE PLAYED. SOME MAPS ARE FOR TWO PLAYERS, SOME FOR FOUR, AND ANY MAP CAN BE PLAYED WITH ANY COMBINATION OF HUMAN AND COMPUTER PLAYERS. THE COMPUTER VERSIONS ALSO FEATURE AN EDITOR.

THE GAME IS PLAYED ON A LARGE MAP MADE UP OF HEXAGONAL SPACES, EACH OF WHICH CONSISTS OF ONE OF THE INCLUDED  TERRAIN TYPES. EACH PLAYER CONTROLS A NUMBER OF UNITS (BOUGHT WITH MONEY), WHICH EACH TAKE UP ONE SPACE ON THE GRID. THE UNIT TYPES ARE FOR THE MOST PART BASED ON REAL-LIFE MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM AROUND THE TIME THE GAME WAS RELEASED, WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE PLAYER DEPENDS ON THE CHOSEN FACTION. THE CHOICES RANGE FROM SINGLE NATIONS, SUCH AS CHINA OR THE USA (THE CD PORT BY MICROCABIN IN PARTICULAR ADDS A LOT OF SMALLER ONES, LIKE SWEDEN AND LIBYA),  TO ALLIANCES AND BLOCS, FOR EXAMPLE NATO, WHICH USES A MIXTURE OF EQUIPMENT OF IT'S MEMBERS. 

DIFFERENT UNITS HAVE DIFFERENT STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES, WHICH AFFECT THEIR PERFORMANCE IN COMBAT AND THEIR GENERAL ROLE ON THE BATTLEFIELD. THE CHEAP INFANTRY UNITS FOR EXAMPLE ARE NOT VERY STRONG AND MOBILE, BUT MAY CAPTURE FACILITIES AND CITIES, UNLIKE BATTLE TANKS. TERRAIN ALSO AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF BATTLES. THE GOAL OF EACH GAME IS TO CAPTURE THE OTHER PLAYERS' CAPITALS.</desc>

THE GAME ALSO KEPT THE INNOVATION FROM THE ARCADE GAMES OF THE TWO-PLAYER MODE AND BROUGHT IN 15 STAGES FOR SIMULTANEOUS ACTION.

THE GAME KEEPS THE TYPICAL GAMEPLAY OF THE LODE RUNNER SERIES. PLAYERS HAVE TO COLLECT ALL THE GOLD ON THE STAGE, WHILE EITHER AVOIDING OR TRAPPING THE ROBOTIC GUARDS WHO ARE CONSTANTLY GIVING THEM CHASE. THE GAME ALSO FEATURES A LEVEL EDITOR SO PLAYERS CAN CREATE THEIR OWN STAGES TO PLAY ON.

A FEW MONTHS AFTER THIS GAME WAS RELEASED, SUPER LODE RUNNER II WAS RELEASED WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THIS GAME, ONLY IT INCLUDED DIFFERENT STAGES FROM THE ARCADE GAMES. ALSO, THIS GAME SHOULDN'T BE CONFUSED WITH THE MSX GAME WITH THE SAME TITLE. WHILE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION AS THIS GAME, IT CONTAINS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SET OF STAGES TO PLAY.</desc>

MON MON MONSTER IS AN ARCADE PLATFORM GAME WITH SOME TOUCHES OF ADVENTURE. WITH YOUR MONSTER, YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH A MAZE OF SCREENS. YOUR PATH IS BLOCKED AT ALL TIMES BY BOULDERS AND ANNOYING CREATURES. THE ACTION TAKES PLACE OVER THE ENTIRE SCREEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME INFORMATION AT THE BOTTOM. IN THE FIELDS YOU CAN FIND LOTS OF USEFUL OBJECTS SUCH AS "ROCKS", THE NORMAL METHOD OF DEFEATING AN OPPONENT IS SIMPLY DONE WITH THE FIRE BUTTON. WITH THIS YOU REACH THE EFFECT OF A PUNCH STROKE OR WHEN YOU ARE STANDING AT A DISTANCE, YOU SHOOT A PROJECTILE. YOU THROW THE BOULDERS USING A COMBINATION OF THE STICK AND 2ND FIRE BUTTON. NOT REALLY EASY BUT PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT. YOU CAN ALSO FIND EXTRA LIFE OR SUPPLEMENT THE REMAINING ENERGY. EVEN SECRET PASSAGES ARE NOT LACKING IN THIS GAME NOR ARE DIFFICULT PASSAGES SUCH AS WATER FOUNTAINS. WITH A PRESS OF THE STOP KEY YOU PAUSE THE GAME AND A CARD IS ALSO PLACED ON THE SCREEN. ON THAT CARD YOU CAN READ YOUR CURRENT POSFTY AS WELL AS THE SCREENS YOU HAVE ALREADY VIEWED AND ALSO THE POSITION OF THE BOSS IS INDICATED. HOWEVER, THIS CARD DOES NOT HELP YOU MUCH, SINCE YOU STILL HAVE TO REACH YOUR GOAL THROUGH SECRET PASSAGES. I HAVE NOT YET FINISHED THE FIRST INTERNSHIP. HAVE YOU LOST ALL YOUR LIVES YOU CAN CONTINUE TO PLAY THROUGH A CONTINUOUS OPTION. HOWEVER, YOU WILL STILL START AT THE BEGINNING OF THE INTERNSHIP, BUT ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN RETAINED WILL BE RETAINED. MON MON MONSTER LOOKS GRAPHICALLY WELL-CARED FOR THE MUSIC IS WELCOME, THANKS TO THE FACT THAT THE MUSICAL POSSIBILITIES OF THE FM-PAC ARE USED. THE MOVEMENTS ARE SMOOTH AND "FRANKIE1" LETS YOU STEER WELL THE IDEA IS NOT VERY INTERESTING, BUT STILL FASCINATING.</desc>

THE GAME'S SCRAMBLE MODE ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO CONTROL THREE OTHER AIRCRAFTS IN ADDITION TO THE SERIS' TRADEMARK SOLVALOU, EACH POSSESSING UNIQUE WEAPONS.

A SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT CAN BE ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THE PLAYER'S "LIVES". THE AMOUNT OF POINTS NEEDED TO GATHER AN EXTRA LIFE INCREASES IF THE PLAYER SELECTS MORE POWERFUL SHIPS.

PLAYS OUT PRETTY MUCH LIKE A BONKERS LIVE ACTION ANIME MOVIE. ITS A CAMP SCIENCE FICTION FANTASY COMEDY ABOUT A GIRL WHOSE SECRETLY THE LONE FIGHTER OF JUSTICE STAR VIRGIN, ITS HER PURSUIT TO STOP THE PLANET BEING ATTACKED FROM ROBOTIC &amp; PUPPET MONSTERS, GIANT SPIDERS AND WHATEVER ELSE WOULD WARRANT AS BEING AN END OF LEVEL BOSS IN AN 80S VIDEO GAME... AT LEAST I THINK THATS THE OVERALL IDEA, BECAUSE ITS OBVIOUSLY NEVER BEEN TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH ITS HARD TO TOTALLY FATHOM OUT WHAT THE HELLS GOING ON, BUT HEY THATS THE BEAUTY OF THE JAPANESE MOVIES RIGHT.

STAR VIRGIN HERSELF IS EVERY JAPANORAMA FANBOYS WETDREAM, SHES A CUTE PINK POWER RANGER WITH HER OWN SPACECRAFT &amp; POWERBIKE AND SHE KICKS ASS WITH A BAZOOKA. THE WHOLE THING WOULD HAVE MADE AN AWESOME MUSIC VIDEO FOR THE FLAMING LIPS - YOSHIMI BATTLES THE PINK ROBOTS (WHAT I'M ODDLY PLAYING WHILE WRITING THIS). SURE ITS NONE ESSENTIAL THROWAWAY STUFF, BUT ITS A FUN HOUR EVEN WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

		<desc>IN THE PAST, THE COURAGEOUS HERO OPA-OPA SAVED THE FANTASY ZONE FROM THE INVADING NENON FORCES, BUT HIS VICTORY CAME AT A PRICE AS HE WAS FORCED TO FIGHT HIS OWN FATHER WHO LED THE INVASION. IT IS NOW SPACE YEAR 1432, 10 YEARS AFTER THAT BATTLE, AND THE NENON FORCES ARE ONCE AGAIN SPREADING CHAOS THROUGH THE FANTASY ZONE. OPA-OPA MUST ONCE AGAIN FLY INTO THE FANTASY ZONE TO ROUT THE INVASION. SIMILAR TO DEFENDER, THE PLAYER OCCUPIES A SIDE-SCROLLING LEVEL THAT REPEATS INDEFINITELY, AND IN WHICH THE PLAYER CAN FREELY TRAVEL LEFT OR RIGHT. EACH ZONE CONTAINS SEVERAL "BASES" THAT SERVE AS PRIMARY TARGETS. NEW TO THE SEQUEL ARE "WARPS" HIDDEN BEHIND CERTAIN BASES THAT ALLOW THE PLAYER TO TRAVEL BETWEEN DIFFERENT ZONES. EACH LEVEL HAS AT LEAST THREE ZONES, AND WHEN ALL OF THE BASES HAVE BEEN CLEARED IN ALL OF THE ZONES OF A LEVEL, THE PLAYER CAN TRAVEL THROUGH THE WARP TO THE BOSS. BOSS FIGHTS DO NOT ALLOW FOR FREE TRAVEL AS THE MAIN STAGES DO, AND FORCE THE PLAYER TO FACE THE BOSS OR FACE A PARTICULAR DIRECTION. BOSSES ARE GENERALLY VERY LARGE AND CHANGE COLOR TO REFLECT DAMAGE TAKEN. THE FINAL STAGE IS A "BOSS RUSH" IN WHICH THE PLAYER MUST FIGHT A SUCCESSION OF PREVIOUS BOSSES BEFORE FIGHTING THE FINAL BOSS. THERE ARE TWO ACTION BUTTONS THAT CORRESPOND TO TWO TYPES OF ATTACKS, "FIRE" AND "BOMB". THE FIRE ATTACKS SHOOT HORIZONTALLY, AS IN A TYPICAL SHOOTER, AND DIFFERENT VARIANTS CAN BE PURCHASED AT SHOPS. THE BOMB ATTACKS ARE MORE POWERFUL, AND THE BASIC BOMB DROPS DOWNWARD. OTHER VARIANTS HAVE OTHER BEHAVIORS AND ARE LIMITED IN QUANTITY. SHOPS, UNCOVERED AT KEY POINTS, ALLOW THE PLAYER TO PURCHASE UPGRADED WEAPONS, BOMBS, AND SPEED, AS WELL AS EXTRA LIVES.[8] UPGRADES TO OPA-OPA'S SPEED (SUCH AS LARGER WINGS, OR JET ENGINES) ARE PERMANENT AS LONG AS THE PLAYER DOES NOT LOSE A LIFE, BUT WEAPON UPGRADES ARE TIME-LIMITED, AND BOMBS LIMITED IN QUANTITY. ITEMS BECOME INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE WITH SUBSEQUENT PURCHASES, ENCOURAGING THE PLAYER TO VARY THEIR PURCHASES.</desc>

		<desc>NEAR THE END OF THE 20TH CENTURY, A SMALL FORTIFIED NATION NAMED OUTER HEAVEN (FOUNDED BY A MYSTERIOUS WAR HERO WHOSE NAME AND IDENTITY ARE SHROUDED IN SECRECY) IS THREATENING THE NATIONS OF THE "WEST" WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW PROTOTYPE WEAPON NAMED METAL GEAR, A WALKING TANK WHICH IS CAPABLE OF LAUNCHING NUCLEAR WARHEADS FROM ANYWHERE ON THE GLOBE. AS FOX-HOUND'S (AN ELITE BLACK OPS UNIT) NEWEST RECRUIT, GOING BY THE CODENAME OF SOLID SNAKE, YOUR MISSION IS TO INFILTRATE OUTER HEAVEN AND RESCUE YOUR MISSING COMRADE, GREY FOX (WHO WAS CAPTURED AFTER A FAILED INFILTRATION), WHILE GATHERING INTELLIGENCE ON METAL GEAR. 

IN ORDER TO FULFILL THIS OBJECTIVE, THE PLAYER MUST COLLECT VARIOUS WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENTS (INCLUDING KEYCARDS FOR FURTHER ACCESS INTO THE FORTRESS), WHILE AVOIDING VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE ENEMY. THE PLAYER MUST ALSO CONFRONT BOSSES IN THE FORM OF OUTER HEAVEN'S ELITE MERCENARY FORCE AND RESCUE HOSTAGES HIDDEN WITHIN THE FORTRESS IN ORDER TO INCREASE PLAYER RANK, WHICH GIVES SNAKE AN EXTENDED LIFE BAR AND INCREASED STORAGE CAPACITY FOR REPLENISHABLE ITEMS AND AMMO. THE PLAYER CAN USE A WIRELESS TRANSCEIVER TO COME IN TOUCH WITH THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER, BIG BOSS, TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR CURRENT MISSION OBJECTIVES OR CONTACT ONE OF THE LOCAL RESISTANCE MEMBERS OPERATING COVERTLY WITHIN THE FORTRESS TO GAIN USEFUL TIPS AND INSIGHTS.</desc>

EACH OF MORE THAN TWO-DOZEN STAGES CONSISTS OF A SET OF RAILS IN VARIOUS ARRANGEMENTS, OFTEN LOOPING AROUND EACH OTHER AND SPLITTING IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS. EACH STAGE CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COLORED BALLS WHICH BEGIN IN CORRESPONDING SLOTS, AND AFTER LAUNCHING THEM THE GOAL IS TO RETURN THE BALLS TO THE MATCHING-COLORED SLOTS. THE ONLY INTERACTION THE PLAYER HAS WITH THE BOARD IS SWITCHING TWO SETS OF SPLITS; THERE ARE YELLOW AND BLUE SPLITS, WHICH WILL REDIRECT ANY BALLS MOVING THROUGH THEM, AND THE PLAYER CAN ONLY TURN ALL OF ONE COLOR AS A GROUP. MANY STAGES ALSO CONTAIN BUMPERS AND GATES WHICH WILL AFFECT THE SPEED AND DIRECTION OF THE BALLS. COMPLETING A PUZZLE OFTEN REQUIRES STRATEGIC USE OF THE STAGE'S FEATURES TO BOUNCE BALLS ONTO THE CORRECT PATHS.</desc>

		<desc>IN MOST GAMES YOU HAVE TO ATTACK MONSTERS AS A HERO. IN THIS CASE YOU ARE THE REINCARNATION OF THE CREATURE OF DR. FRANKENSTEIN. THE OPPONENTS, HOWEVER, REMAIN MONSTROUS. MON MON MONSTER IS AN ARCADE PLATFORM GAME WITH SOME TOUCHES OF ADVENTURE. WITH YOUR MONSTER, YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH A MAZE OF SCREENS. YOUR PATH IS BLOCKED AT ALL TIMES BY BOULDERS AND ANNOYING CREATURES. THE ACTION TAKES PLACE OVER THE ENTIRE SCREEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME INFORMATION AT THE BOTTOM. IN THE FIELDS YOU CAN FIND LOTS OF USEFUL OBJECTS SUCH AS "ROCKS", THE NORMAL METHOD OF DEFEATING AN OPPONENT IS SIMPLY DONE WITH THE FIRE BUTTON. WITH THIS YOU REACH THE EFFECT OF A PUNCH STROKE OR WHEN YOU ARE STANDING AT A DISTANCE, YOU SHOOT A PROJECTILE. YOU THROW THE BOULDERS USING A COMBINATION OF THE STICK AND 2ND FIRE BUTTON. NOT REALLY EASY BUT PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT. YOU CAN ALSO FIND EXTRA LIFE OR SUPPLEMENT THE REMAINING ENERGY. EVEN SECRET PASSAGES ARE NOT LACKING IN THIS GAME NOR ARE DIFFICULT PASSAGES SUCH AS WATER FOUNTAINS. WITH A PRESS OF THE STOP KEY YOU PAUSE THE GAME AND A CARD IS ALSO PLACED ON THE SCREEN. ON THAT CARD YOU CAN READ YOUR CURRENT POSFTY AS WELL AS THE SCREENS YOU HAVE ALREADY VIEWED AND ALSO THE POSITION OF THE BOSS IS INDICATED. HOWEVER, THIS CARD DOES NOT HELP YOU MUCH, SINCE YOU STILL HAVE TO REACH YOUR GOAL THROUGH SECRET PASSAGES. I HAVE NOT YET FINISHED THE FIRST INTERNSHIP. HAVE YOU LOST ALL YOUR LIVES YOU CAN CONTINUE TO PLAY THROUGH A CONTINUOUS OPTION. HOWEVER, YOU WILL STILL START AT THE BEGINNING OF THE INTERNSHIP, BUT ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN RETAINED WILL BE RETAINED. MON MON MONSTER LOOKS GRAPHICALLY WELL-CARED FOR THE MUSIC IS WELCOME, THANKS TO THE FACT THAT THE MUSICAL POSSIBILITIES OF THE FM-PAC ARE USED. THE MOVEMENTS ARE SMOOTH AND "FRANKIE1" LETS YOU STEER WELL THE IDEA IS NOT VERY INTERESTING, BUT STILL FASCINATING.</desc>

		<desc>THE GAME TELLS ANOTHER STORY IN NINJA-KUN SERIES. THIS TIME ITÂS A PLATFORM GAME WITH SOME TWISTS. THERE ARE TWO TASKS ALTERNATING THROUGH LEVELS: YOU ARE REQUIRED EITHER TO KILL EVERY ENEMY IN THE LEVEL (AS IN THE PREVIOUS GAMES) OR SIMPLY TO REACH THE EXIT. RUNNING INTO ENEMIES USUALLY WONÂT KILL YOU, HOWEVER IF YOU ARE HIT BY A SINGLE PROJECTILE, YOUÂLL HAVE TO START FROM A CHECKPOINT. ENEMIES VARY FROM PLAIN NINJAS TO GIANT SKELETONS OR KILLER FISH. EACH LEVEL HAS A TIME LIMIT, AND WHEN THIS LIMIT IS CLOSE TO AN END A FIRE WHEEL OF DEATH WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN, CHASING NINJA-KUN.

NINJA-KUN HAS SOME TECHNIQUES FOR SUCCESSFUL PROGRESSION THOUGH THE LEVELS: MANY ENEMIES CAN BE TEMPORARILY STUNNED BY JUMPING ON THEM OR HITTING THEM FROM BELOW; AND NINJA CAN OBTAIN SOME POWER-UPS INCLUDING BOOMERANG, BOMBS, A DEVASTATING FIRE ATTACK OR INVINCIBILITY. NINJA-KUN IS CAPABLE OF WALL CLIMBING AND WALL JUMPING, THE LATTER REQUIRING SOME PRACTICE FROM THE PLAYER.

THE LEVELS (CALLED ÂSCENESÂ IN-GAME) ARE SCATTERED THROUGH MOUNTAINS, CAVES, BEACHES AND UNDERWATER LOCATIONS. YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH SET OF LEVELS YOUÂLL START IN BY PLAYING A MINI-GAME AT THE BEGINNING.</desc>

THE PLAYER'S GOAL IN EVERY LEVEL IS TO REACH THE FINAL STAGE WHERE THE PROTAGONIST FACES THE LEVEL BOSS. THERE ARE OFTEN SEVERAL WAYS TO REACH THE FINAL STAGES, AND NOT ALL STAGES ARE NECESSARY TO VISIT. EQUIPPED WITH A SWORD, THE PLAYER CHARACTER MOVES THROUGH PLATFORM STAGES, CLEARING THEM OF DIVERSE MONSTERS, COLLECTING POWER-UPS AND TRYING TO STAY IN GOOD HEALTH UNTIL THE LEVEL BOSS, SINCE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAL BETWEEN THE STAGES. THE HERO'S LIFE METER (CALLED "VITALITY" IN THE GAME) IS THE FIRST INTRODUCTION OF SUCH A FEATURE TO ACTION GAMES.</desc>

REPLICART IS A SINGLE-PLAYER ONLY SNAKE GAME VARIANT. IN EACH OF THE 300 STAGES YOU HAVE TO COLLECT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF A SUBSTANCE CALLED 'BITESLIME'. ONCE YOU FULFILL YOUR QUOTA YOU CAN ENTER THE NEXT STAGE THROUGH AN EXIT THAT OPENS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN. COLLECTING BITESLIME INCREASES THE LENGTH OF YOUR SNAKE. IF THE HEAD OF YOUR SNAKE HITS A WALL, AN ENEMY OR PART OF ITS BODY YOU LOSE A LIFE.  REPLICART ENHANCES THE BASIC SNAKE GAME FORMULA BY ADDING POWER UPS LIKE A TIME STOP, WHICH FREEZES ENEMIES, SPEED INCREASE/DECREASE OR LEVEL WARPS.

THE FAMICOM DISK SYSTEM VERSION HAS UNDERGONE A FEW CHANGES. THERE ARE ONLY 100 STAGES AND AFTER EACH 10 STAGES YOU HAVE TO FACE A BOSS, WHICH MUST BE SHOT DOWN BEFORE CONTINUING TO THE NEXT SET OF STAGES.</desc>

		<desc>THE GAME TAKES PLACE WITHIN A GIGANTIC SPACESHIP WHICH HAS VIRTUALLY INFINITE CAPACITY BECAUSE OF ITS ABILITY TO MANIPULATE TIME AND SPACE. THE PLAYER MUST DEAL WITH ENIGMATIC CREATURES CALLED EVOL, WHICH CONSIST ONLY OF PURE ENERGY AND NEED TO KEEP THEMSELVES IN CAPSULES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEIR EXISTENCE IN THE WORLD.
ALL OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE GAME ARE DESIGNED TO RESEMBLE MICROSCOPIC ORGANISMS, BOTH IN THEIR APPEARANCE AND THEIR QUICK, TRICKY MOVEMENTS. THE PLAYER'S SHIP UNDERGOES OVER 10 TYPES OF TRANSFORMATIONS THROUGHOUT THE GAME, EACH WITH OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE MANEUVERS SPECIFIC TO THEIR DESIGN. THE SOUND EFFECTS USED ARE MINIMAL, BUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOUNDS ARE USED ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF SHOTS OR THEIR SPEED. A SOUND RESEMBLING A LONG SCREAM RESULTS WHEN THE PLAYER'S SHIP IS HIT AND RETURNS TO ITS WEAKEST EVOLUTIONARY STATE. THE GAME'S DESIGNER, GRAPHIC DESIGNER, AND MUSIC COMPOSER, TOMO FURUKAWA, WOULD GO ON TO BECOME THE VOCALIST OF THE BAND GUNIW TOOLS.THE GAME CONTROLS LIKE A REGULAR SHOOT-'EM-UP: A AND C SHOOT BULLETS, B DROPS BOMBS; THERE IS RAPIDFIRE. HOWEVER, UNLIKE REGULAR SHOOT-'EM-UPS WHERE WEAPONS ARE UPGRADED THROUGH POWERUPS, YOUR SHIP "EVOLVES" TO SURVIVE SITUATIONS AND GET PAST OBSTACLES. EVOLUTION OCCURS WITH THE EVOL (SMALL FACES WITH AN E ON THEM) AND B-EVOL (DARKER EVOLS). EACH PICKUP ADDS A NEW EVOLUTION STATE TO THE LIST. AFTER A PARTICULAR AMOUNT OF TIME, ONE EVOLUTION WEARS OFF AND THE NEXT EVOLUTION IS CHOSEN. THE DNA POWERUP DOES PROVIDE A MORE PERMANENT WEAPON UPGRADE, BUT WILL MERELY JUST MAKE THE EXISTING WEAPONS STRONGER. YOU CAN HOLD UP TO NINE DNA POWERUPS.</desc>

DOING SO WILL ALLOW THE PLAYER TO COLLECT A PORT KEY WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO SET ANCHOR ON ONE OF THE TITULAR SEVEN ISLANDS. THE PLAYER MUST THEN REMOVE THE BOSS OF THAT ISLAND AND RECOVER THE TREASURE.

THE GAME IS BROKEN UP INTO FOUR ZONES THAT ARE COMPOSED OF EIGHT AREAS EACH. IN EACH AREA PLAYERS HAVE TO COLLECT ALL THE VISIBLE ITEMS LAYING AROUND TO COMPLETE THAT AREA. ONCE ALL THE ITEMS ARE COLLECTED IN THE SEVEN AREAS OF A ZONE, PLAYERS CAN THEN ENTER THE EIGHTH AREA WHERE THEY WILL FIND ONE OF THEIR BANDMATES LOCKED INSIDE A CAGE. WHILE COLLECTING ALL THE VISIBLE ITEMS, PLAYERS WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY ATTACKED BY ENEMIES THAT THEY CAN EITHER TRY TO JUMP AND DODGE OR SHOOT THEIR PROJECTILE WEAPON AT THEM. GETTING HIT BY AN ENEMY WILL DECREASE THE PLAYERS LIFE, WHICH IS ALREADY CONSTANTLY DRAINING.

ONE OF THE ITEMS THE PLAYER COLLECTS ARE MONEYBAGS. COLLECTED MONEYBAGS EARN THE PLAYER MONEY WHICH CAN IN TURN BE SPENT AT THE VARIOUS SHOPS FOUND THROUGHOUT THE GAME. SHOPS SELL LIFE POTIONS, STRONGER WEAPONS, AND ALSO MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS FOR EACH BAND MEMBER.</desc>

IN ORDER TO FULFILL THIS OBJECTIVE, THE PLAYER MUST COLLECT VARIOUS WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENTS (INCLUDING KEYCARDS FOR FURTHER ACCESS INTO THE FORTRESS), WHILE AVOIDING VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE ENEMY. THE PLAYER MUST ALSO CONFRONT BOSSES IN THE FORM OF OUTER HEAVEN'S ELITE MERCENARY FORCE AND RESCUE HOSTAGES HIDDEN WITHIN THE FORTRESS IN ORDER TO INCREASE PLAYER RANK, WHICH GIVES SNAKE AN EXTENDED LIFE BAR AND INCREASED STORAGE CAPACITY FOR REPLENISHABLE ITEMS AND AMMO. THE PLAYER CAN USE A WIRELESS TRANSCEIVER TO COME IN TOUCH WITH THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER, BIG BOSS, TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR CURRENT MISSION OBJECTIVES OR CONTACT ONE OF THE LOCAL RESISTANCE MEMBERS OPERATING COVERTLY WITHIN THE FORTRESS TO GAIN USEFUL TIPS AND INSIGHTS.</desc>

UNLIKE ALESTE 1, YOU ARE NOT CONTROLLING A SPACESHIP, BUT INSTEAD YOU'RE CONTROLLING A ROBOT. HOWEVER, LIKE ALESTE, YOU CAN SHOOT ENEMIES, ENEMIES CAN SHOOT YOU, COLLECT POWER UPS, AND DEFEAT BOSSES AT THE END OF A LEVEL. HOWEVER, NEW TO THIS GAME IS THE ABILITY TO JUMP OVER HOLES IN THE GROUND. THIS ADDS A NEW CHALLENGE TO THE GAME. IN SOME LEVELS, THERE ARE EVEN OBSTACLES LIKE CARS THAT YOU HAVE TO AVOID. POWER UPS RANGE FROM ONE THAT CLONES YOURSELF AND CAN FIRE LASERS WITH YOU, ONE THAT REPLACES YOUR DEFAULT LASER WITH SHURIKENS. ONE REPLACES YOUR DEFAULT WEAPON AND INSTEAD SHOOTS RED TARGETS THAT GO IN A ZIG-ZAG. THIS LASER HAS A POSSIBLITY OF SHOOTING ENEMIES. THE KINDS OF POWER-UPS ARE MARKED BY THE COLOR OF THEIR BOX-CONTAINERS AND THE JAPANESE LETTER ON THEM.</desc>

BUBBLE BOBBLE IS A PLATFORM GAME, WITH EACH LEVEL BEING A SINGLE SCREEN. THE ENEMIES MUST BE CLEARED FROM A LEVEL TO GO TO THE NEXT ONE. WITH ONE PLAYER CONTROLLING BUB AND THE OTHER CONTROLLING BOB, THE PLAYER CAN JUMP AND COLLECT ITEMS FOR POINTS (SUCH AS FRUIT). THE REAL POWER BUB AND BOB HAVE HOWEVER IS THE ABILITY TO BLOW BUBBLES. THESE BUBBLES CAN BE AS PLATFORMS TO LEAP ON, OR TO TRAP ENEMIES. ENEMIES TRAPPED IN A BUBBLE MUST BE POPPED BY JUMPING INTO THEM, WHEREIN THEY'LL TURN TO FRUIT. ADDITIONALLY, POWER-UPS SOMETIMES FLOAT BY IN BUBBLES. THEY INCLUDE LIGHTNING, WHICH FLIES OUT HORIZONTALLY AT ENEMIES, AND WATER, WHICH DRAGS THE PLAYER AND ENEMIES STRAIGHT DOWN FLOWING OVER PLATFORMS. TAKING TOO LONG TO COMPLETE ANY LEVEL WILL SUMMON BARON VON BLUBBA, WHO WILL FLOAT AROUND THE SCREEN TRYING TO DESTROY THE PLAYER.</desc>

		<desc>SUPER DAISENRYAKU IS ONE OF THE MANY TITLES IN SYSTEMSOFT'S LONG-RUNNING WAR STRATEGY SERIES. THE GAME MECHANICS ARE BASED ON DAISENRYAKU II, BUT MANY OF THE INCLUDED MAPS ARE UNIQUE TO THIS RELEASE, INCLUDING SEVERAL BASED ON PHANTASY STAR IN SEGA'S CONSOLE VERSION. THERE IS NO CAMPAIGN MODE, AND ANY OF THE INCLUDED MAPS CAN BE PLAYED. SOME MAPS ARE FOR TWO PLAYERS, SOME FOR FOUR, AND ANY MAP CAN BE PLAYED WITH ANY COMBINATION OF HUMAN AND COMPUTER PLAYERS. THE COMPUTER VERSIONS ALSO FEATURE AN EDITOR.

THE GAME IS PLAYED ON A LARGE MAP MADE UP OF HEXAGONAL SPACES, EACH OF WHICH CONSISTS OF ONE OF THE INCLUDED  TERRAIN TYPES. EACH PLAYER CONTROLS A NUMBER OF UNITS (BOUGHT WITH MONEY), WHICH EACH TAKE UP ONE SPACE ON THE GRID. THE UNIT TYPES ARE FOR THE MOST PART BASED ON REAL-LIFE MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM AROUND THE TIME THE GAME WAS RELEASED, WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE PLAYER DEPENDS ON THE CHOSEN FACTION. THE CHOICES RANGE FROM SINGLE NATIONS, SUCH AS CHINA OR THE USA (THE CD PORT BY MICROCABIN IN PARTICULAR ADDS A LOT OF SMALLER ONES, LIKE SWEDEN AND LIBYA),  TO ALLIANCES AND BLOCS, FOR EXAMPLE NATO, WHICH USES A MIXTURE OF EQUIPMENT OF IT'S MEMBERS. 

DIFFERENT UNITS HAVE DIFFERENT STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES, WHICH AFFECT THEIR PERFORMANCE IN COMBAT AND THEIR GENERAL ROLE ON THE BATTLEFIELD. THE CHEAP INFANTRY UNITS FOR EXAMPLE ARE NOT VERY STRONG AND MOBILE, BUT MAY CAPTURE FACILITIES AND CITIES, UNLIKE BATTLE TANKS. TERRAIN ALSO AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF BATTLES. THE GOAL OF EACH GAME IS TO CAPTURE THE OTHER PLAYERS' CAPITALS.</desc>

		<desc>DRUID IS AN ACTION GAME INSPIRED BY THE ARCADE HIT GAUNTLET. AS THE EPONYMOUS HERO, YOUR JOB IS TO DESTROY FOUR MAGIC SKULLS HIDDEN OVER EIGHT LEVELS. 

THE GAME IS PRESENTED IN A TOP-DOWN VIEW. THE DRUID WALKS AROUND THE TERRAIN SEEKING OUT THE STAIRCASE THAT LEADS TO THE NEXT LEVEL. ON THE WAY, HE IS HARASSED BY HORDES OF MONSTERS THAT COME OUT OF EVERY DIRECTION AND ATTACK HIM, DECREASING HIS HEALTH. TO DEFEND HIMSELF, THE DRUID CAN USE THE SPELLS OF WATER, FIRE OR ELECTRICITY TO TOSS PROJECTILES. HOWEVER, THESE MAGICAL WEAPONS HAVE LIMITED AMMO. 

THE DRUID ALSO HAS THREE OTHER MAGICAL SPELLS AT HIS DISPOSAL - AN INVISIBILITY SPELL WHICH PREVENTS THE MONSTERS FROM AUTOMATICALLY APPROACHING HIM, A GOLEM SPELL WHICH SUMMONS A HELPFUL GOLEM (WHICH CAN BE CONTROLLED BY A SECOND PLAYER), AND A SKULL SPELL WHICH DESTROYS ALL ON-SCREEN ENEMIES. THE DRUID ALSO CARRIES AROUND KEYS WHICH OPEN LOCKED DOORS. BUT ALL THESE HAVE VERY LIMITED SUPPLIES. 

ON HIS WAY, THE DRUID FINDS MANY SHOPS. EACH SUCH SHOP CONTAINS SOME KEYS OR CHARGES FOR THE DRUID'S SPELLS, BUT THE DRUID CAN ONLY PICK ONE ITEM FROM EACH SHOP. 

THE DRUID CAN ALSO COME ACROSS A PENTAGRAM ON THE GROUND WHICH WILL RESTORE HIS LOST HEALTH.</desc>

THE WORLD OF DRANSYLVANIA IS IN TROUBLE, AND YOU ARE THE ONE TO SET IT RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO FIGHT YOUR WAY THROUGH 18 STAGES OF DEMONS TO WHERE DRACULA IS HIDING. ONCE YOU HAVE DESTROYED DRACULA, THE EVIL FORCE BEHIND ALL THE TROUBLE WILL SHOW UP, ATTEMPTING TO DESTROY YOU! DESTROY THIS MENACE, AND DRANSYLVANIA WILL RETURN TO IT'S HAPPY DAYS AFTER A WAIT OF HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

VAMPIRE KILLER FOLLOWS THE SAME PLOT AS CASTLEVANIA, BUT WITH A DIFFERENT GAMEPLAY. AT EACH STAGE, SIMON HAS TO FIND A WHITE KEY TO OPEN THE EXIT DOOR WHICH LEADS TO THE NEXT STAGE. THE KEYS ARE USUALLY HIDDEN IN THE CASTLE'S WALLS, IN WHICH HE WILL ALSO FIND USEFUL ITEMS. ITEMS CAN ALSO BE FOUND BY WHIPPING CANDLES AND OTHER SOURCES OF LIGHT INSIDE THE CASTLE.

AMONG THE ITEMS WHICH CAN BE FOUND ARE:
GOLD CROSS: WIPES OUT ALL ENEMIES;
SILVER CROSS: PREVENT ENEMIES FROM APPEARING FOR A SHORT TIME;
SAPPHIRE RING: RENDERS SIMON INVINCIBLE FOR A SHORT TIME;
BLUE CRYSTAL: RENDERS SIMON INVISIBLE FOR A SHORT TIME;
YELLOW KEY: IS USED TO OPEN CHESTS CONTAINING ITEMS;
CANDLE: HIGHLIGHTS DESTRUCTIBLE WALLS; 
MAP: CAN BE USED UP TO THREE TIMES AND SHOWS SIMON LOCATION N THE CASTLE;
RED BOOK: INCREASES ITEM'S PRICES;
WHITE BOOK: DECREASES ITEM'S PRICES
TAN SHIELD: BLOCKS ENEMY ATTACKS;
RED SHIELD: REDUCES DAMAGE UPON ENEMY CONTACT;
BOOTS: MAKE SIMON WALK FASTER;
WINGS: MAKE SIMON JUMP HIGHER;
HOLY WATER: A SECONDARY WEAPON, WHICH USES HEARTS AS AMMUNITION;
HOURGLASS: STOPS ENEMY MOVEMENT FOR A SHORT TIME, CONSUMING HEARTS.
HEARTS ARE BOTH A KIND OF AMMUNITION AND CURRENCY IN THE GAME. THEY CAN BE FOUND BY WHIPPING CANDLES OR KILLING ENEMIES. THEY ARE USED FOR BUYING ITEMS FROM THE OLD CRONE AND AS AMMO FOR THE HOLY WATER AND THE HOURGLASS.

SIMON CAN ALSO FIND SEVERAL PRIMARY WEAPONS IN THE GAME, SUCH AS WHIP UPGRADES, A THROWING DAGGER, AN AXE AND A CROSS. DIFFERENTLY FROM CASTLEVANIA, THE DAGGER, AXE AND CROSS REPLACE THE WHIP AND DO NOT USE HEARTS AS AMMO.</desc>

THE GAME IS BROKEN UP INTO FOUR ZONES THAT ARE COMPOSED OF EIGHT AREAS EACH. IN EACH AREA PLAYERS HAVE TO COLLECT ALL THE VISIBLE ITEMS LAYING AROUND TO COMPLETE THAT AREA. ONCE ALL THE ITEMS ARE COLLECTED IN THE SEVEN AREAS OF A ZONE, PLAYERS CAN THEN ENTER THE EIGHTH AREA WHERE THEY WILL FIND ONE OF THEIR BANDMATES LOCKED INSIDE A CAGE. WHILE COLLECTING ALL THE VISIBLE ITEMS, PLAYERS WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY ATTACKED BY ENEMIES THAT THEY CAN EITHER TRY TO JUMP AND DODGE OR SHOOT THEIR PROJECTILE WEAPON AT THEM. GETTING HIT BY AN ENEMY WILL DECREASE THE PLAYERS LIFE, WHICH IS ALREADY CONSTANTLY DRAINING.

ONE OF THE ITEMS THE PLAYER COLLECTS ARE MONEYBAGS. COLLECTED MONEYBAGS EARN THE PLAYER MONEY WHICH CAN IN TURN BE SPENT AT THE VARIOUS SHOPS FOUND THROUGHOUT THE GAME. SHOPS SELL LIFE POTIONS, STRONGER WEAPONS, AND ALSO MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS FOR EACH BAND MEMBER.</desc>

		<desc>XEVIOUS: FARDRAUT SAGA IS A VERTICALLY-SCROLLING SHOOTER THAT CONTAINS TWO MODES: RECON AND SCRAMBLE. THE RECON MODE IS A PORT OF THE ARCADE GAME XEVIOUS; THE SCRAMBLE MODE CAN BE CONSIDERED ITS SEQUEL, ADDING SIXTEEN NEW STAGES, ENEMIES, AND BOSS BATTLES, AS THE BRAVE FIGHTER PILOTS CONTINUE TO DEFEND THE EARTH AGAINST ITS FORMER INHABITANTS, WHO MIGRATED TO THE PLANET XEVIOUS THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO AND ARE NOW DETERMINED TO RE-CAPTURE THEIR ANCESTRAL HOMELAND.

THE GAME'S SCRAMBLE MODE ALLOWS THE PLAYER TO CONTROL THREE OTHER AIRCRAFTS IN ADDITION TO THE SERIS' TRADEMARK SOLVALOU, EACH POSSESSING UNIQUE WEAPONS. THESE AIRCRAFTS INCLUDE SOLGRADO (ARMED WITH SPREAD SHOT), ZEODALLEY (TWIN BACK FIRE), AND GAMPMISSION, A LARGE SHIP THAT IS ALSO A COMBINATION OF THE PREVIOUS THREE, WITH MASSIVE FIREPOWER AND ENHANCED LOCK-ON ABILITIES. A SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT CAN BE ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THE PLAYER'S "LIVES". THE AMOUNT OF POINTS NEEDED TO GATHER AN EXTRA LIFE INCREASES IF THE PLAYER SELECTS MORE POWERFUL SHIPS. ALSO, ENEMIES BECOME PROGRESSIVELY HARDER AS THE CONTROLLED AIRCRAFT COLLECTS POWER-UPS.</desc>

THE GAME CONSISTS OF SIX PYRAMIDS EACH WITH ITS OWN WALL ENGRAVINGS AND COLOR PATTERN; EVERY PYRAMID CONTAINS 10 LEVELS. THE IDEA OF THE GAME IS TO COLLECT CRYSTALS CALLED SOUL STONES IN EACH LEVEL BY SOLVING THE DIFFERENT PUZZLES AND EVADING OR KILLING THE ENEMIES USING THE MANY TOOLS AND WEAPONS AVAILABLE TO UNLOCK THE EXIT DOOR THAT WILL TAKE YOU TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

THE GAME WAS RELEASED BOTH FOR THE MSX1 AND MSX2 SYSTEMS. THE MSX2 VERSION ONLY SAW A RELEASE IN JAPAN. THE MSX 2 VERSION WAS THE SAME GAME EXCEPT MINOR CHANGES LIKE THE MUSIC WAS REMIXED AND SOME OF THE ITEMS AND BACKGROUNDS RECOLORED.</desc>

BUBBLE BOBBLE IS A PLATFORM GAME, WITH EACH LEVEL BEING A SINGLE SCREEN. THE ENEMIES MUST BE CLEARED FROM A LEVEL TO GO TO THE NEXT ONE. WITH ONE PLAYER CONTROLLING BUB AND THE OTHER CONTROLLING BOB, THE PLAYER CAN JUMP AND COLLECT ITEMS FOR POINTS (SUCH AS FRUIT). THE REAL POWER BUB AND BOB HAVE HOWEVER IS THE ABILITY TO BLOW BUBBLES. THESE BUBBLES CAN BE AS PLATFORMS TO LEAP ON, OR TO TRAP ENEMIES. ENEMIES TRAPPED IN A BUBBLE MUST BE POPPED BY JUMPING INTO THEM, WHEREIN THEY'LL TURN TO FRUIT. ADDITIONALLY, POWER-UPS SOMETIMES FLOAT BY IN BUBBLES. THEY INCLUDE LIGHTNING, WHICH FLIES OUT HORIZONTALLY AT ENEMIES, AND WATER, WHICH DRAGS THE PLAYER AND ENEMIES STRAIGHT DOWN FLOWING OVER PLATFORMS. TAKING TOO LONG TO COMPLETE ANY LEVEL WILL SUMMON BARON VON BLUBBA, WHO WILL FLOAT AROUND THE SCREEN TRYING TO DESTROY THE PLAYER.</desc>

		<desc>THE GAME TAKES PLACE WITHIN A GIGANTIC SPACESHIP WHICH HAS VIRTUALLY INFINITE CAPACITY BECAUSE OF ITS ABILITY TO MANIPULATE TIME AND SPACE. THE PLAYER MUST DEAL WITH ENIGMATIC CREATURES CALLED EVOL, WHICH CONSIST ONLY OF PURE ENERGY AND NEED TO KEEP THEMSELVES IN CAPSULES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEIR EXISTENCE IN THE WORLD.
ALL OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE GAME ARE DESIGNED TO RESEMBLE MICROSCOPIC ORGANISMS, BOTH IN THEIR APPEARANCE AND THEIR QUICK, TRICKY MOVEMENTS. THE PLAYER'S SHIP UNDERGOES OVER 10 TYPES OF TRANSFORMATIONS THROUGHOUT THE GAME, EACH WITH OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE MANEUVERS SPECIFIC TO THEIR DESIGN. THE SOUND EFFECTS USED ARE MINIMAL, BUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOUNDS ARE USED ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF SHOTS OR THEIR SPEED. A SOUND RESEMBLING A LONG SCREAM RESULTS WHEN THE PLAYER'S SHIP IS HIT AND RETURNS TO ITS WEAKEST EVOLUTIONARY STATE. THE GAME'S DESIGNER, GRAPHIC DESIGNER, AND MUSIC COMPOSER, TOMO FURUKAWA, WOULD GO ON TO BECOME THE VOCALIST OF THE BAND GUNIW TOOLS.THE GAME CONTROLS LIKE A REGULAR SHOOT-'EM-UP: A AND C SHOOT BULLETS, B DROPS BOMBS; THERE IS RAPIDFIRE. HOWEVER, UNLIKE REGULAR SHOOT-'EM-UPS WHERE WEAPONS ARE UPGRADED THROUGH POWERUPS, YOUR SHIP "EVOLVES" TO SURVIVE SITUATIONS AND GET PAST OBSTACLES. EVOLUTION OCCURS WITH THE EVOL (SMALL FACES WITH AN E ON THEM) AND B-EVOL (DARKER EVOLS). EACH PICKUP ADDS A NEW EVOLUTION STATE TO THE LIST. AFTER A PARTICULAR AMOUNT OF TIME, ONE EVOLUTION WEARS OFF AND THE NEXT EVOLUTION IS CHOSEN. THE DNA POWERUP DOES PROVIDE A MORE PERMANENT WEAPON UPGRADE, BUT WILL MERELY JUST MAKE THE EXISTING WEAPONS STRONGER. YOU CAN HOLD UP TO NINE DNA POWERUPS.</desc>

MON MON MONSTER IS AN ARCADE PLATFORM GAME WITH SOME TOUCHES OF ADVENTURE. WITH YOUR MONSTER, YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH A MAZE OF SCREENS. YOUR PATH IS BLOCKED AT ALL TIMES BY BOULDERS AND ANNOYING CREATURES. THE ACTION TAKES PLACE OVER THE ENTIRE SCREEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME INFORMATION AT THE BOTTOM. IN THE FIELDS YOU CAN FIND LOTS OF USEFUL OBJECTS SUCH AS "ROCKS", THE NORMAL METHOD OF DEFEATING AN OPPONENT IS SIMPLY DONE WITH THE FIRE BUTTON. WITH THIS YOU REACH THE EFFECT OF A PUNCH STROKE OR WHEN YOU ARE STANDING AT A DISTANCE, YOU SHOOT A PROJECTILE. YOU THROW THE BOULDERS USING A COMBINATION OF THE STICK AND 2ND FIRE BUTTON. NOT REALLY EASY BUT PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT. YOU CAN ALSO FIND EXTRA LIFE OR SUPPLEMENT THE REMAINING ENERGY. EVEN SECRET PASSAGES ARE NOT LACKING IN THIS GAME NOR ARE DIFFICULT PASSAGES SUCH AS WATER FOUNTAINS. WITH A PRESS OF THE STOP KEY YOU PAUSE THE GAME AND A CARD IS ALSO PLACED ON THE SCREEN. ON THAT CARD YOU CAN READ YOUR CURRENT POSFTY AS WELL AS THE SCREENS YOU HAVE ALREADY VIEWED AND ALSO THE POSITION OF THE BOSS IS INDICATED. HOWEVER, THIS CARD DOES NOT HELP YOU MUCH, SINCE YOU STILL HAVE TO REACH YOUR GOAL THROUGH SECRET PASSAGES. I HAVE NOT YET FINISHED THE FIRST INTERNSHIP. HAVE YOU LOST ALL YOUR LIVES YOU CAN CONTINUE TO PLAY THROUGH A CONTINUOUS OPTION. HOWEVER, YOU WILL STILL START AT THE BEGINNING OF THE INTERNSHIP, BUT ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN RETAINED WILL BE RETAINED. MON MON MONSTER LOOKS GRAPHICALLY WELL-CARED FOR THE MUSIC IS WELCOME, THANKS TO THE FACT THAT THE MUSICAL POSSIBILITIES OF THE FM-PAC ARE USED. THE MOVEMENTS ARE SMOOTH AND "FRANKIE1" LETS YOU STEER WELL THE IDEA IS NOT VERY INTERESTING, BUT STILL FASCINATING.</desc>

		<name>Replicart</name>
		<desc>IT IS THE 22ND CENTURY. EARTH IS INVADED BY A ALIENS, LED BY A GIGANTIC ROBOTIC SNAKE. TO REPEL THE ATTACK, EARTH'S SCIENTISTS CONSTRUCT THE REPLICART MACHINE, A DEADLY ROBOT SNAKE. THE PLAYER TAKES THE ROLE OF THE PILOT OF THE REPLICART.

REPLICART IS A SINGLE-PLAYER ONLY SNAKE GAME VARIANT. IN EACH OF THE 300 STAGES YOU HAVE TO COLLECT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF A SUBSTANCE CALLED 'BITESLIME'. ONCE YOU FULFILL YOUR QUOTA YOU CAN ENTER THE NEXT STAGE THROUGH AN EXIT THAT OPENS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN. COLLECTING BITESLIME INCREASES THE LENGTH OF YOUR SNAKE. IF THE HEAD OF YOUR SNAKE HITS A WALL, AN ENEMY OR PART OF ITS BODY YOU LOSE A LIFE.  REPLICART ENHANCES THE BASIC SNAKE GAME FORMULA BY ADDING POWER UPS LIKE A TIME STOP, WHICH FREEZES ENEMIES, SPEED INCREASE/DECREASE OR LEVEL WARPS.

THE FAMICOM DISK SYSTEM VERSION HAS UNDERGONE A FEW CHANGES. THERE ARE ONLY 100 STAGES AND AFTER EACH 10 STAGES YOU HAVE TO FACE A BOSS, WHICH MUST BE SHOT DOWN BEFORE CONTINUING TO THE NEXT SET OF STAGES.</desc>

IN ORDER TO FULFILL THIS OBJECTIVE, THE PLAYER MUST COLLECT VARIOUS WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENTS (INCLUDING KEYCARDS FOR FURTHER ACCESS INTO THE FORTRESS), WHILE AVOIDING VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE ENEMY. THE PLAYER MUST ALSO CONFRONT BOSSES IN THE FORM OF OUTER HEAVEN'S ELITE MERCENARY FORCE AND RESCUE HOSTAGES HIDDEN WITHIN THE FORTRESS IN ORDER TO INCREASE PLAYER RANK, WHICH GIVES SNAKE AN EXTENDED LIFE BAR AND INCREASED STORAGE CAPACITY FOR REPLENISHABLE ITEMS AND AMMO.

THERE ARE TWO TASKS ALTERNATING THROUGH LEVELS: YOU ARE REQUIRED EITHER TO KILL EVERY ENEMY IN THE LEVEL (AS IN THE PREVIOUS GAMES) OR SIMPLY TO REACH THE EXIT. RUNNING INTO ENEMIES USUALLY WONÂT KILL YOU, HOWEVER IF YOU ARE HIT BY A SINGLE PROJECTILE, YOUÂLL HAVE TO START FROM A CHECKPOINT. ENEMIES VARY FROM PLAIN NINJAS TO GIANT SKELETONS OR KILLER FISH. EACH LEVEL HAS A TIME LIMIT, AND WHEN THIS LIMIT IS CLOSE TO AN END A FIRE WHEEL OF DEATH WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN, CHASING NINJA-KUN.

NINJA-KUN HAS SOME TECHNIQUES FOR SUCCESSFUL PROGRESSION THOUGH THE LEVELS: MANY ENEMIES CAN BE TEMPORARILY STUNNED BY JUMPING ON THEM OR HITTING THEM FROM BELOW; AND NINJA CAN OBTAIN SOME POWER-UPS INCLUDING BOOMERANG, BOMBS, A DEVASTATING FIRE ATTACK OR INVINCIBILITY. NINJA-KUN IS CAPABLE OF WALL CLIMBING AND WALL JUMPING, THE LATTER REQUIRING SOME PRACTICE FROM THE PLAYER.

THE LEVELS (CALLED ÂSCENESÂ IN-GAME) ARE SCATTERED THROUGH MOUNTAINS, CAVES, BEACHES AND UNDERWATER LOCATIONS. YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH SET OF LEVELS YOUÂLL START IN BY PLAYING A MINI-GAME AT THE BEGINNING.</desc>

		<desc>SUPER DAISENRYAKU IS ONE OF THE MANY TITLES IN SYSTEMSOFT'S LONG-RUNNING WAR STRATEGY SERIES. THE GAME MECHANICS ARE BASED ON DAISENRYAKU II, BUT MANY OF THE INCLUDED MAPS ARE UNIQUE TO THIS RELEASE, INCLUDING SEVERAL BASED ON PHANTASY STAR IN SEGA'S CONSOLE VERSION. THERE IS NO CAMPAIGN MODE, AND ANY OF THE INCLUDED MAPS CAN BE PLAYED. SOME MAPS ARE FOR TWO PLAYERS, SOME FOR FOUR, AND ANY MAP CAN BE PLAYED WITH ANY COMBINATION OF HUMAN AND COMPUTER PLAYERS. THE COMPUTER VERSIONS ALSO FEATURE AN EDITOR.

THE GAME IS PLAYED ON A LARGE MAP MADE UP OF HEXAGONAL SPACES, EACH OF WHICH CONSISTS OF ONE OF THE INCLUDED  TERRAIN TYPES. EACH PLAYER CONTROLS A NUMBER OF UNITS (BOUGHT WITH MONEY), WHICH EACH TAKE UP ONE SPACE ON THE GRID. THE UNIT TYPES ARE FOR THE MOST PART BASED ON REAL-LIFE MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM AROUND THE TIME THE GAME WAS RELEASED, WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE PLAYER DEPENDS ON THE CHOSEN FACTION. THE CHOICES RANGE FROM SINGLE NATIONS, SUCH AS CHINA OR THE USA (THE CD PORT BY MICROCABIN IN PARTICULAR ADDS A LOT OF SMALLER ONES, LIKE SWEDEN AND LIBYA),  TO ALLIANCES AND BLOCS, FOR EXAMPLE NATO, WHICH USES A MIXTURE OF EQUIPMENT OF IT'S MEMBERS. 

DIFFERENT UNITS HAVE DIFFERENT STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES, WHICH AFFECT THEIR PERFORMANCE IN COMBAT AND THEIR GENERAL ROLE ON THE BATTLEFIELD. THE CHEAP INFANTRY UNITS FOR EXAMPLE ARE NOT VERY STRONG AND MOBILE, BUT MAY CAPTURE FACILITIES AND CITIES, UNLIKE BATTLE TANKS. TERRAIN ALSO AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF BATTLES. THE GOAL OF EACH GAME IS TO CAPTURE THE OTHER PLAYERS' CAPITALS.</desc>

		<desc>DRUID IS AN ACTION GAME INSPIRED BY THE ARCADE HIT GAUNTLET. AS THE EPONYMOUS HERO, YOUR JOB IS TO DESTROY FOUR MAGIC SKULLS HIDDEN OVER EIGHT LEVELS. 

THE GAME IS PRESENTED IN A TOP-DOWN VIEW. THE DRUID WALKS AROUND THE TERRAIN SEEKING OUT THE STAIRCASE THAT LEADS TO THE NEXT LEVEL. ON THE WAY, HE IS HARASSED BY HORDES OF MONSTERS THAT COME OUT OF EVERY DIRECTION AND ATTACK HIM, DECREASING HIS HEALTH. TO DEFEND HIMSELF, THE DRUID CAN USE THE SPELLS OF WATER, FIRE OR ELECTRICITY TO TOSS PROJECTILES. HOWEVER, THESE MAGICAL WEAPONS HAVE LIMITED AMMO. 

THE DRUID ALSO HAS THREE OTHER MAGICAL SPELLS AT HIS DISPOSAL - AN INVISIBILITY SPELL WHICH PREVENTS THE MONSTERS FROM AUTOMATICALLY APPROACHING HIM, A GOLEM SPELL WHICH SUMMONS A HELPFUL GOLEM (WHICH CAN BE CONTROLLED BY A SECOND PLAYER), AND A SKULL SPELL WHICH DESTROYS ALL ON-SCREEN ENEMIES. THE DRUID ALSO CARRIES AROUND KEYS WHICH OPEN LOCKED DOORS. BUT ALL THESE HAVE VERY LIMITED SUPPLIES. 

ON HIS WAY, THE DRUID FINDS MANY SHOPS. EACH SUCH SHOP CONTAINS SOME KEYS OR CHARGES FOR THE DRUID'S SPELLS, BUT THE DRUID CAN ONLY PICK ONE ITEM FROM EACH SHOP. 

THE DRUID CAN ALSO COME ACROSS A PENTAGRAM ON THE GROUND WHICH WILL RESTORE HIS LOST HEALTH.</desc>

		<desc>IN THE PAST, THE COURAGEOUS HERO OPA-OPA SAVED THE FANTASY ZONE FROM THE INVADING NENON FORCES, BUT HIS VICTORY CAME AT A PRICE AS HE WAS FORCED TO FIGHT HIS OWN FATHER WHO LED THE INVASION. IT IS NOW SPACE YEAR 1432, 10 YEARS AFTER THAT BATTLE, AND THE NENON FORCES ARE ONCE AGAIN SPREADING CHAOS THROUGH THE FANTASY ZONE. OPA-OPA MUST ONCE AGAIN FLY INTO THE FANTASY ZONE TO ROUT THE INVASION. SIMILAR TO DEFENDER, THE PLAYER OCCUPIES A SIDE-SCROLLING LEVEL THAT REPEATS INDEFINITELY, AND IN WHICH THE PLAYER CAN FREELY TRAVEL LEFT OR RIGHT. EACH ZONE CONTAINS SEVERAL "BASES" THAT SERVE AS PRIMARY TARGETS. NEW TO THE SEQUEL ARE "WARPS" HIDDEN BEHIND CERTAIN BASES THAT ALLOW THE PLAYER TO TRAVEL BETWEEN DIFFERENT ZONES. EACH LEVEL HAS AT LEAST THREE ZONES, AND WHEN ALL OF THE BASES HAVE BEEN CLEARED IN ALL OF THE ZONES OF A LEVEL, THE PLAYER CAN TRAVEL THROUGH THE WARP TO THE BOSS. BOSS FIGHTS DO NOT ALLOW FOR FREE TRAVEL AS THE MAIN STAGES DO, AND FORCE THE PLAYER TO FACE THE BOSS OR FACE A PARTICULAR DIRECTION. BOSSES ARE GENERALLY VERY LARGE AND CHANGE COLOR TO REFLECT DAMAGE TAKEN. THE FINAL STAGE IS A "BOSS RUSH" IN WHICH THE PLAYER MUST FIGHT A SUCCESSION OF PREVIOUS BOSSES BEFORE FIGHTING THE FINAL BOSS. THERE ARE TWO ACTION BUTTONS THAT CORRESPOND TO TWO TYPES OF ATTACKS, "FIRE" AND "BOMB". THE FIRE ATTACKS SHOOT HORIZONTALLY, AS IN A TYPICAL SHOOTER, AND DIFFERENT VARIANTS CAN BE PURCHASED AT SHOPS. THE BOMB ATTACKS ARE MORE POWERFUL, AND THE BASIC BOMB DROPS DOWNWARD. OTHER VARIANTS HAVE OTHER BEHAVIORS AND ARE LIMITED IN QUANTITY. SHOPS, UNCOVERED AT KEY POINTS, ALLOW THE PLAYER TO PURCHASE UPGRADED WEAPONS, BOMBS, AND SPEED, AS WELL AS EXTRA LIVES.[8] UPGRADES TO OPA-OPA'S SPEED (SUCH AS LARGER WINGS, OR JET ENGINES) ARE PERMANENT AS LONG AS THE PLAYER DOES NOT LOSE A LIFE, BUT WEAPON UPGRADES ARE TIME-LIMITED, AND BOMBS LIMITED IN QUANTITY. ITEMS BECOME INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE WITH SUBSEQUENT PURCHASES, ENCOURAGING THE PLAYER TO VARY THEIR PURCHASES.</desc>

		<desc>LONG AGO, AN EVIL DRAGON NAMED KEELA WAS IMPRISONED INSIDE A MAGICAL DUNGEON. HOWEVER TIME HAS PASSED AND THE MAGIC THAT SEALED THE DRAGON AWAY IS WEAKENING. THE DRASLE FAMILY DECIDES THAT IT'S TIME TO DESTROY THE DRAGON ONCE AND FOR ALL. HOWEVER ONLY ONE WEAPON IS CAPABLE OF DOING THIS, THE DRAGON SLAYER, WHICH IS ITSELF SEALED AWAY BY FOUR MAGICAL CROWNS. THE DRASLE FAMILY DECIDES TO TAKE ON THIS QUEST, AND WILL USE EVERY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH IT.
THE PLAYER CHOOSES A CHARACTER FROM AMONG FIVE DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE DRASLE FAMILY. THE CHOICES ARE: XEMM THE FATHER AND WOODCUTTER, MAYNA THE MAGIC-USING MOTHER, ROAS THE BRAVE WARRIOR SON, LYLL THE ATHLETIC DAUGHTER AND POCHI THE DOMESTICATED MONSTER-PET. EACH CHARACTER HAS UNIQUE ABILITIES (INCLUDING ATTACK AND JUMPING ABILITIES) AND CAN ONLY USE CERTAIN ITEMS FROM THOSE COLLECTED. PLAYERS CAN TRAVEL BACK TO THE DRASLE HOUSEHOLD AT ANY POINT TO CHANGE CHARACTERS.

THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO ENTER THE LARGE DUNGEON, ITSELF DIVIDED INTO 5 AREAS, COLLECTING A VARIETY OF ITEMS (WHICH AS MENTIONED, CAN ONLY BE USED BY PARTICULAR CHARACTERS) AND USE THEM TO PROGRESS THROUGH THE DUNGEON, DEFEATING MONSTERS. POWER-UPS DROPPED BY MONSTERS INCLUDE GOLD, KEYS, HEALTH-RESTORING BREAD, MAGIC-RESTORING POTIONS AND HEALTH-DAMAGING POISON. GOLD CAN BE SPENT ON ITEMS AND OTHER POWER-UPS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AT VARIOUS SHOPS HIDDEN INSIDE THE DUNGEON. THE PLAYER MUST EVENTUALLY DEFEAT THE FOUR BOSSES GUARDING THE CROWNS THAT SEAL THE DRAGON SLAYER AND THEN USE THAT WEAPON TO DEFEAT THE KRESS.</desc>

THE WORLD OF DRANSYLVANIA IS IN TROUBLE, AND YOU ARE THE ONE TO SET IT RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO FIGHT YOUR WAY THROUGH 18 STAGES OF DEMONS TO WHERE DRACULA IS HIDING. ONCE YOU HAVE DESTROYED DRACULA, THE EVIL FORCE BEHIND ALL THE TROUBLE WILL SHOW UP, ATTEMPTING TO DESTROY YOU! DESTROY THIS MENACE, AND DRANSYLVANIA WILL RETURN TO IT'S HAPPY DAYS AFTER A WAIT OF HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

VAMPIRE KILLER FOLLOWS THE SAME PLOT AS CASTLEVANIA, BUT WITH A DIFFERENT GAMEPLAY. AT EACH STAGE, SIMON HAS TO FIND A WHITE KEY TO OPEN THE EXIT DOOR WHICH LEADS TO THE NEXT STAGE. THE KEYS ARE USUALLY HIDDEN IN THE CASTLE'S WALLS, IN WHICH HE WILL ALSO FIND USEFUL ITEMS. ITEMS CAN ALSO BE FOUND BY WHIPPING CANDLES AND OTHER SOURCES OF LIGHT INSIDE THE CASTLE.

AMONG THE ITEMS WHICH CAN BE FOUND ARE:
GOLD CROSS: WIPES OUT ALL ENEMIES;
SILVER CROSS: PREVENT ENEMIES FROM APPEARING FOR A SHORT TIME;
SAPPHIRE RING: RENDERS SIMON INVINCIBLE FOR A SHORT TIME;
BLUE CRYSTAL: RENDERS SIMON INVISIBLE FOR A SHORT TIME;
YELLOW KEY: IS USED TO OPEN CHESTS CONTAINING ITEMS;
CANDLE: HIGHLIGHTS DESTRUCTIBLE WALLS; 
MAP: CAN BE USED UP TO THREE TIMES AND SHOWS SIMON LOCATION N THE CASTLE;

SIMON CAN ALSO FIND SEVERAL PRIMARY WEAPONS IN THE GAME, SUCH AS WHIP UPGRADES, A THROWING DAGGER, AN AXE AND A CROSS. DIFFERENTLY FROM CASTLEVANIA, THE DAGGER, AXE AND CROSS REPLACE THE WHIP AND DO NOT USE HEARTS AS AMMO.</desc>

EACH OF MORE THAN TWO-DOZEN STAGES CONSISTS OF A SET OF RAILS IN VARIOUS ARRANGEMENTS, OFTEN LOOPING AROUND EACH OTHER AND SPLITTING IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS. EACH STAGE CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COLORED BALLS WHICH BEGIN IN CORRESPONDING SLOTS, AND AFTER LAUNCHING THEM THE GOAL IS TO RETURN THE BALLS TO THE MATCHING-COLORED SLOTS. THE ONLY INTERACTION THE PLAYER HAS WITH THE BOARD IS SWITCHING TWO SETS OF SPLITS; THERE ARE YELLOW AND BLUE SPLITS, WHICH WILL REDIRECT ANY BALLS MOVING THROUGH THEM, AND THE PLAYER CAN ONLY TURN ALL OF ONE COLOR AS A GROUP. MANY STAGES ALSO CONTAIN BUMPERS AND GATES WHICH WILL AFFECT THE SPEED AND DIRECTION OF THE BALLS.

PLAYS OUT PRETTY MUCH LIKE A BONKERS LIVE ACTION ANIME MOVIE. ITS A CAMP SCIENCE FICTION FANTASY COMEDY ABOUT A GIRL WHOSE SECRETLY THE LONE FIGHTER OF JUSTICE STAR VIRGIN, ITS HER PURSUIT TO STOP THE PLANET BEING ATTACKED FROM ROBOTIC &amp; PUPPET MONSTERS, GIANT SPIDERS AND WHATEVER ELSE WOULD WARRANT AS BEING AN END OF LEVEL BOSS IN AN 80S VIDEO GAME... AT LEAST I THINK THATS THE OVERALL IDEA, BECAUSE ITS OBVIOUSLY NEVER BEEN TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH ITS HARD TO TOTALLY FATHOM OUT WHAT THE HELLS GOING ON, BUT HEY THATS THE BEAUTY OF THE JAPANESE MOVIES RIGHT.

STAR VIRGIN HERSELF IS EVERY JAPANORAMA FANBOYS WETDREAM, SHES A CUTE PINK POWER RANGER WITH HER OWN SPACECRAFT &amp; POWERBIKE AND SHE KICKS ASS WITH A BAZOOKA.

		<desc>LONG AGO, AN EVIL DRAGON NAMED KEELA WAS IMPRISONED INSIDE A MAGICAL DUNGEON. HOWEVER TIME HAS PASSED AND THE MAGIC THAT SEALED THE DRAGON AWAY IS WEAKENING. THE DRASLE FAMILY DECIDES THAT IT'S TIME TO DESTROY THE DRAGON ONCE AND FOR ALL. HOWEVER ONLY ONE WEAPON IS CAPABLE OF DOING THIS, THE DRAGON SLAYER, WHICH IS ITSELF SEALED AWAY BY FOUR MAGICAL CROWNS. THE DRASLE FAMILY DECIDES TO TAKE ON THIS QUEST, AND WILL USE EVERY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH IT.
THE PLAYER CHOOSES A CHARACTER FROM AMONG FIVE DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE DRASLE FAMILY. THE CHOICES ARE: XEMM THE FATHER AND WOODCUTTER, MAYNA THE MAGIC-USING MOTHER, ROAS THE BRAVE WARRIOR SON, LYLL THE ATHLETIC DAUGHTER AND POCHI THE DOMESTICATED MONSTER-PET. EACH CHARACTER HAS UNIQUE ABILITIES (INCLUDING ATTACK AND JUMPING ABILITIES) AND CAN ONLY USE CERTAIN ITEMS FROM THOSE COLLECTED. PLAYERS CAN TRAVEL BACK TO THE DRASLE HOUSEHOLD AT ANY POINT TO CHANGE CHARACTERS.

THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO ENTER THE LARGE DUNGEON, ITSELF DIVIDED INTO 5 AREAS, COLLECTING A VARIETY OF ITEMS (WHICH AS MENTIONED, CAN ONLY BE USED BY PARTICULAR CHARACTERS) AND USE THEM TO PROGRESS THROUGH THE DUNGEON, DEFEATING MONSTERS. POWER-UPS DROPPED BY MONSTERS INCLUDE GOLD, KEYS, HEALTH-RESTORING BREAD, MAGIC-RESTORING POTIONS AND HEALTH-DAMAGING POISON. GOLD CAN BE SPENT ON ITEMS AND OTHER POWER-UPS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AT VARIOUS SHOPS HIDDEN INSIDE THE DUNGEON. THE PLAYER MUST EVENTUALLY DEFEAT THE FOUR BOSSES GUARDING THE CROWNS THAT SEAL THE DRAGON SLAYER AND THEN USE THAT WEAPON TO DEFEAT THE KRESS.</desc>

		<desc>NEAR THE END OF THE 20TH CENTURY, A SMALL FORTIFIED NATION NAMED OUTER HEAVEN (FOUNDED BY A MYSTERIOUS WAR HERO WHOSE NAME AND IDENTITY ARE SHROUDED IN SECRECY) IS THREATENING THE NATIONS OF THE "WEST" WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW PROTOTYPE WEAPON NAMED METAL GEAR, A WALKING TANK WHICH IS CAPABLE OF LAUNCHING NUCLEAR WARHEADS FROM ANYWHERE ON THE GLOBE. AS FOX-HOUND'S (AN ELITE BLACK OPS UNIT) NEWEST RECRUIT, GOING BY THE CODENAME OF SOLID SNAKE, YOUR MISSION IS TO INFILTRATE OUTER HEAVEN AND RESCUE YOUR MISSING COMRADE, GREY FOX (WHO WAS CAPTURED AFTER A FAILED INFILTRATION), WHILE GATHERING INTELLIGENCE ON METAL GEAR. 

IN ORDER TO FULFILL THIS OBJECTIVE, THE PLAYER MUST COLLECT VARIOUS WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENTS (INCLUDING KEYCARDS FOR FURTHER ACCESS INTO THE FORTRESS), WHILE AVOIDING VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE ENEMY. THE PLAYER MUST ALSO CONFRONT BOSSES IN THE FORM OF OUTER HEAVEN'S ELITE MERCENARY FORCE AND RESCUE HOSTAGES HIDDEN WITHIN THE FORTRESS IN ORDER TO INCREASE PLAYER RANK, WHICH GIVES SNAKE AN EXTENDED LIFE BAR AND INCREASED STORAGE CAPACITY FOR REPLENISHABLE ITEMS AND AMMO. THE PLAYER CAN USE A WIRELESS TRANSCEIVER TO COME IN TOUCH WITH THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER, BIG BOSS, TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR CURRENT MISSION OBJECTIVES OR CONTACT ONE OF THE LOCAL RESISTANCE MEMBERS OPERATING COVERTLY WITHIN THE FORTRESS TO GAIN USEFUL TIPS AND INSIGHTS.</desc>

		<name>Super Lode Runner</name>
		<desc>BETWEEN 1984 TO 1986, IREM RELEASED FOUR MORE DIFFERENT LODE RUNNER ARCADE GAMES IN JAPAN AFTER THE ORIGINAL ARCADE GAMES RELEASE.  55 STAGES WERE CULLED FROM THESE ARCADE GAMES AND WERE PACKAGED INTO SUPER LODE RUNNER FOR THE FAMICOM DISK SYSTEM. THE GAME ALSO KEPT THE INNOVATION FROM THE ARCADE GAMES OF THE TWO-PLAYER MODE AND BROUGHT IN 15 STAGES FOR SIMULTANEOUS ACTION.

THE GAME KEEPS THE TYPICAL GAMEPLAY OF THE LODE RUNNER SERIES. PLAYERS HAVE TO COLLECT ALL THE GOLD ON THE STAGE, WHILE EITHER AVOIDING OR TRAPPING THE ROBOTIC GUARDS WHO ARE CONSTANTLY GIVING THEM CHASE. THE GAME ALSO FEATURES A LEVEL EDITOR SO PLAYERS CAN CREATE THEIR OWN STAGES TO PLAY ON.

A FEW MONTHS AFTER THIS GAME WAS RELEASED, SUPER LODE RUNNER II WAS RELEASED WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THIS GAME, ONLY IT INCLUDED DIFFERENT STAGES FROM THE ARCADE GAMES. ALSO, THIS GAME SHOULDN'T BE CONFUSED WITH THE MSX GAME WITH THE SAME TITLE. WHILE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION AS THIS GAME, IT CONTAINS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SET OF STAGES TO PLAY.</desc>
